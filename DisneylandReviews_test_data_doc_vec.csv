"Typical Disneyland except the small area. Very accessible by train from all corners of HK. Very crowded and some adults fight with kids to get ahead in Q. Please hold on tight to your young kids to avoid being pushed over by over zealous adults.","Neutral"
"This Disney is a smaller version of the other Disney parks with a smaller amount of rides. The Jungle cruise is different from the Florida park and Its a Small World is longer. No Tom Sawyer island and no Liberty Square. The parade is very good. There are many Asian dishes on restaurant menus. It is easy to get to on the direct Disneyland MTR line. I thought the entrance price should be $10 $15 lower than it was. ","Positive"
"Hope this is helpful.If travelling by Eurostar dont bother with the advance check in service offered by Disney. Simply use the free shuttle buses from outside the train station and check yourself in and save money.The breakfast is pretty poor so dont waste time booking a slot. Use the magic hours to get in the park before the masses and have breakfast in the park. The longest queue is for Thunder Mountain so do this first. When the queue splits take the right queue as this moves quicker. The food and drink in the Disney Village is overpriced, however, Cafe Mickey is a great laugh with full on interaction with the characters. Stay at your table though as you will be ushered away if you approach the characters. Avoid McDonalds, they haven't got a clue. Service in Planet Hollywood is appalling. Bon Voyage!","Neutral"
"Too much of a crowd makes it a hassle to wait for your turns at the rides. Though flushed with great rides, the disneyland visit requires a lot of patience and time to cover the rides","Positive"
"It was an amazing place to be with all our favourite Disney characters but it's very small which is quite of a bit disappointment. We completed the place from 11am to 4pm with several coaster trips and musical shows. We waited for the fireworks which was good. Food was not too good though for a place like this. I don't think I will be back again unless there are something new to it. ","Neutral"
"My 3rd trip in life, 1st time for the girl I am dating. We spent the day being kids. I strongly urge purchasing the TWO PARK tickets. Magic Kingdom PLUS California Adventure (Keep turning right). California Adventure is like a Coney Island Boardwalk with great rides and a superfast looped roller coaster. It's Disney's answer to Magic Mountain, Six Flags or Knotts Berry farm.","Positive"
"We went in May to celebrate for the 25 Anniversary and my 30th Birthday, 10th wedding anniversary and our daughters birthdays.We were disappointed to find many rides shut down to be repaired. Then it rained so many more ended up closing also. It isn't fair to compare it to Disneyworld or Disneyland. I did a lot of research and heard about the economic woes. They do show. We overall enjoyed the trip because we went with the mindset that we got what we paid for. We were privileged that they offered a Military discount to military from all countries. I recommend if you are military to request it and save money. It is more compared to a amusement park such as Six Flags, Gardaland, or the likes than Disneyworld. It was overall enjoyable and more affordable however. I will say I loved the dragon in the castle and the stained glass display! I also did get to attend one show which was also enjoyable. There transportation to and from the park was tremendously helpful and the lines were bearable.","Neutral"
"I was REALLY excited to go to HK Disneyland as it would be my first Disney Experience. However, all I ended up with was disappointment.  The bad:  * Lack of rides   as stated by previous members, there is really only 1 good ride for...More","Negative"
"This was our 10th visit to disneyland paris , everytime we've been here we've always enjoyed it.This time , the attitude of the people has changed , we found the people whether serving in shops , or at dinner or the public in general all very rude. I don't know whether it's the Austerity cuts getting people down , but their attitude this time stank . And they don't like to give you change for a note , I asked one shop assistant for my change and he actually shoved it in my hand , how rude is that . As always the rides are great , as are the parades and characters. But I seriously would like disney to employ better manord staff , this ruined the whole disney experience for me this time , and I for one won't be going back again.We stayed in what I regard as the best hotel Sequoia Lodge , which has been refurbished and as always top notch , atmosphere excellent , food excellent as was the pool for the kids. Well worth it .","Neutral"
"For someone who has a deep love for the Disney brands, and who has been to both parks located in the United States (numerous times), this Disney Park was a huge disappointment. Every thing was wrong   even the half complete palace! Children were out of control. Parent were too busy playing on their mobile phones to pay attention to their children. I wouldn't recommend this Hong Kong Disneyland to you if you have been to any of the other company's parks.","Negative"
"The rides are great as Disney   s quality and It is not too crowded so there is no long wait time. However, cast members are below par. Anytime I asked for something, they either tell me to ask other guys or try to answer as quick as possible and walk away. When you are in the line and not pay attention enough, someone will pass you and cut you in front.","Neutral"
"During a recent stay in England we took our daughter and her family to Euro Disney. Our grandchildren are two and four. The park is extremely expensive, example: four sandwiches and five drinks were fifty Euros or the equivalent of $75 CDN. The park itself was dirty and run down. Since the park is situated out in the country away from any town of any size, you pretty well have to stay at one of their hotels. It was rated as three stars....I would say it was greatly over rated. Faulty bathroom fixtures, broken telephone and heat blasting away on a 28 degree C. day. Calls to maintenance were ignored. I would suggest avoiding this Disney...go to one in the US, there is no comparison.","Negative"
"Disneyland is more like a Six Flags theme park. People kept telling us that it's not like DisneyWorld and I agree, it's missing the DisneyWorld Magic. The staff is not as friendly and the Park overall is outdated, with the exception of Cars Land which was amazing.","Neutral"
"What's not to love about Disneyland. A few hints. Go on the weekdays for less people. Download the Disney app and use the information as for times of special events and DO THE MAX PASS. Well worth the $10 a day. Do it on your phone it's much easier than having to find a Max pass booth. Plan a head and make a couple of food reservations you can always cancel but good luck trying to get into one if there very good restaurants without a reservation. Make reservations a head for Downtown Disney also. ","Positive"
"We stayed recently for Feb half term in the Davy Crockett hotel, whilst the accommodation was superb we were left disapointed by the park itself and the subsequent attempts to contact Disneyland. For our final day and on many of the previous days we had lots of rides breaking down, this was on top of many rides already being closed for refurbshment. The queues were then long due to the lower number of available rides. I have now e mailed Disneyland three times since my stay with no reply and through Facebook they have relayed that they answer e mails within 2 5 weeks!!","Negative"
"We had an easy journey from Kings Cross to Marne la Valee. The security was thorough and made us feel very safe. We stayed at the Newport Bay Hotel, thus allowing us to take advantage of 'magic hours' from 8am   10am. During this period, only Disneyland hotel guests may use the park. In one day, we enjoyed 6 rides (4 during magic hours and 2 with a fast pass). The Peter Pan ride was charming and imaginative   traditional Disney. So too was Small World. Buzz Lightyear was fun and I highly recommend the Mickey and the Magician show in the Walt Disney Studios   it was a lavish West End standard show which the whole family would love.This was the 25th anniversary year but large sections were closed off and there were long queues everywhere. Our express breakfast vouchers (offering a croissant, pain au chocolat, omelette burger, orange juice or hot drink) stated they were valid in 3 restaurants, but we were informed that only one restaurant (next to the Buzz Lightyear ride) was opened. We had to walk 10 minutes to the other side of the park. 6 tills were opened, all doing fast food and the same range of drinks, but we were restricted to the last 3 tills. It took half an hour to get our breakfast. The omelette burger (with egg and bacon) was ok but there were no veggie options till after 11am. Food options all over the resort are greasy and toxic. Fortunately the Star Wars themed seating area was spacious and imaginatively laid out like a lunar landscape   this cheered me up a bit.Several rides were functional, charmless and unimaginative e.g. Teacups and carousel. The atmosphere that I'd found on visits to US theme parks was lacking. I got the sense that the Disney charm found in US theme parks was being downplayed to cater to more 'sophisticated' French tastes. It gave the park a drab atmosphere   functional and mundane.During these summer holidays my family have visited Drayton Manor (inc Thomas Land and amazing zoo) theme park and CBeebies land at Alton Towers. We stayed at the child friendly resort hotels in both cases and had a wonderful experience at both. Both places had manageable queues for small children, an excellent variety of food, plenty of staff to help you and short distances between rides.I'd strongly recommend visiting the UK resorts. I can't understand why Disney didn't choose Spain (better weather and food and more child friendly).The Disney magic has been subdued in 'stylish' Paris.","Negative"
"I went to the Disney world in Tokyo and LA., which you can stay few days for these two, but for the Hong Kong one, sorry to tell you that you can finish it in 3 to 4 hours. It is extremely small and the worst is the Cinderella castle, they scare it down to a smaller scale which make it looks really ridiculous. If you had never been to a Disney world, well you can give it a go, but if you tried other Disney world, don't bother and go to ocean park please","Neutral"
"Great for all ages, with kids rides, rollercoasters and a lovely evening street parade with all the classic Disney characters. It even has its own train and train station. Expensive but worth it for families.   Try going during the week to avoid the bigger crowds.","Positive"
"We had a lovely day at Disneyland Paris   it was very easy to get to from the city center and it had all of the fixings to be a really fun park. The attention to detail was good but it just wasn't quite as good as Disney World Florida   so don't quite expect that. Definitely worth the visit though! We were able to see everything we wanted to see in one day but the restaurants did close pretty early the day we were there which we didn't realize would happen so that was a tad disappointing. The fireworks show, though, was absolutely spectacular   highly recommend staying for it! It was wonderful!","Positive"
"We went to into Eurodisney for 2 days with young children and teenagers during school purely for less queues and a cheaper break. We all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and the rides were great! The parade was fab. The only thing was queuing to see the characters but it was worth it! Lots of shops, the food is expensive in there, so take snacks if you can! Your never to old for Disney even for the adults","Positive"
"We were at the Santa Fe Hotel for 2 nights which were the worst experiance that we ever had. It felt like you were living in the Geto ! There was no heat , 1 2 roll of toilet paper in the bathroom every day. Furniture looked like is was bought at a 2nd hand shop. There is no Air condition which they do advertise in there adds, but no heat either . It also looked like it was old and shot. The key system did not work right and whenI went to get another key ,that did not work at all. When I took it back and was discusted the manager went back to my room with a master key and gave me 2 more new ones and said that they must update the hotel . The parks are very clean and fun , up to Disney standards. The hotel was lousey and dirty . Whe you pay about $ 200.00 a night to stay in a hotel you don't expect this kind of treatment . I have stayed at Disney in the states about 10 times and was always satisfied above my expectation. On a scale of 1 to 10 our experiance is 1. Stayed there 10 20 and 10 21 name is James Clements","Negative"
"A fun for kids easy to reach and return booking on line may save you from the long queue the food outlets were pretty much expensive those who have been to other Disney lands may find this very small and not worth. the staff looked as f they were miffed by the atmosphere. They should be well trained in order to avoid unfriendliness; since it ought to be the happiest place.","Positive"
"I was excited to go to disney or so i thought till i got there and was sorely disappointed for all the hype they have on tv it was to much for what was there even though you got free rides and had to pay for eating which was outragoues also. my 4 year old grandson was to old for the rides for 0 3 no fun and was not old enough or tall enoough for the other rides so got to do very little and so disappointed i waited with him while the others had fun on rides they need to change that. I would not go agian even though i did not pay this time i would not pay to go agian very disapointed in the overall of disney would go to san diego sea world and zoo then disney land","Negative"
"Pirates of The Carribbean and Its a Small World are such old rides, maybe an upgrade would help.  The Indiana Jones ride was closed as were a couple of others.  At 20th September, Disneyland was already set up for Halloween!!!  A bit early for me.","Neutral"
"Too many etiquette challenged guests added to stress of queuing in hot weather. My young 4 year old was treated to a couple of shouting matches, swearing and shoving. Staff preferred not to get involved most cases.  Overall stressful and unpleasant.","Negative"
"This is definitely the happiest place on earth for kids. As an adult, stay at the Disneyland Hotel so that you can access the park early and stay late. You can then go hang out in the pool during the crazy afternoon time. I have never seen that many strollers in one place ever, it was similar to seeing the line up of bikes at Sturgis. The restrooms were very gross, and not just one. The standards have declined significantly over the last few years. The rides were just like I remembered and we had a great time! Pirates of the Caribbean is always great! Fantasmic was awesome along with the parade.","Neutral"
"We felt that this Disney is quite overrated, as the rides are not at all thrilling, and we did not encounter a single Disney character during the entire day there. The parade and the light show were also cancelled due to impending weather. I feel that the place is best suited for family with small children, maybe 7 years or less, as the elder kids will look for better rides in which case the Ocean Park is a better option.","Neutral"
"I made my first trip to Disneyland nearly 40 years ago and have been 4 or 5 times since then, as recently as 10 years ago. I've also been to Disney World 3 or 4 times. This most recent trip brought back some fond memories, but I though some of the original Disney esqe touches have been lost. Other's have spoken of the crowds, lines and cost. Disney's PR department seemed to blow it by dramatically raising the park hopper prices three weeks before a new section of California Adventure Park was to open. Seemed greedy. Also there website information was spotty (how do parking shuttles work?), and to have not warned about Grad Night's mobs was very inconsiderate.But I found myself disappointment in the cross marketing of virtually everything. Woody and Jessie show up in Small World. Swiss Family Robinson's tree house is not Tarzan's treehouse and not nearly as whimsical. Even the  Jack Sparrow  additions to Pirates of the Caribbean seemed cheezy. Plus, we experienced several ride breakdowns.No doubt, many of the rides are still spectacular. Our family loved Space Mountain, the Haunted Mansion, Thunder Mtn Railroad, even the cheesy Jungle Cruise, plus we enjoyed the newer rides at CA Park, California Screaming, Soaring over California, among others.I think I would recommend Disney World over Disneyland. One person told us that with the annual passes for locals, it's become a  teen hangout  like the mall, so it's always crowded. Also Disney World, being larger, seems to absorb the crowds better. (Best DL advice, go early in the morning and hit as much as possible as fast as possible, then slow down and accept that there will be lines later in the day.)If you can't make Disney World and want the Disney experience, by all means, go to Disneyland. But know what you are getting into. And for goodness sake, avoid Grad Nights.","Neutral"
"We love the holidays decoration at the Disneyland Park, we purchased the 4 day park hopper tickets to make sure we have enough time to do everything at the park. Due to the technical difficulties, no fireworks for the first 2 days such a disappointment! They do have firework on the Christmas Day   better than expected. During the holidays, over 60,00 people inside the park, need plenty of time for rides, food and even in the restrooms!Don't miss the Aladdin musical show, and also must see World of Color, make sure to get the fast pass early as they run out fast.","Positive"
"Just come back from a weeks trip to France and spent 2 days a Disneyland and I was very disappointed.It was bad enough that you had to wait for ages to get on anything but some of the staff were very rude or unhelpful unless your an attractive female and then they very helpful.Also never saw any of the Disney Characters which I thought was a bit strange.All in all not a very good experience and would recommend Parc Asterix instead.","Neutral"
"Prolly i went at the wrong time but this disneyland is wayyyy too hot and majority of the crowd wasn't too friendly with their incessant pushing and shoving. Generally find it too plain as well and wasn't too impressed versus other disneylands like the one in torcy, france or in japan.Just my 2 cents worth","Neutral"
"as far as Disney land goes . This was a very disorganised park . I have been to the one in Hong Kong where every one was friendly and played their part well. People looked grumpy here and like they did not want to be there. Half the rides were closed as well when we went in and I spent an entire day looking for a popcorn cart with no luck , so it was not as good as my other Disney experience. However in saying that , the grounds were lovely, the castle was beautiful and it's Disney land after all how can you not have fun.","Neutral"
"We go to Disneyland every time we go to Hong Kong, so the kids love it there. As we haven't been to Hong Kong for a couple of years, this time there were new things to see, most notably the Manor (can't remember the full name) and the runaway mine train (Bear something, why couldn't they just call it the runaway mine train?)We went in the Easter holidays, which was great as there were fewer people and virtually no queues (people on mainland China don't get Easter holidays, so there were very few tourists from there). We could go on the rides straight after coming off, so we went on Space Mountain twice and the runaway mine train four times   it was so much fun!My kids being a bit bigger (6 and 8) meant that they had no interest in meeting the characters any more, seeing as we did all that when they were much smaller   this saved us lots of time for the rides. This was probably the most enjoyable time I've had in Hong Kong Disneyland.Disney are really strict about bringing your own food in, they search all your bags at the entrance gates. You are only allowed a small amount of snacks for the children. The food inside is quite good for a theme park, but being Disney of course the price is more than what you would pay outside of the park.Disney Hong Kong are building another extension to the park (something to do with Iron Man), but that won't be open for a couple of years. I look forward to going again in the future, and I'm sure my kids do too.","Positive"
"Flew here from NC for Spring Break. Bee to Disney World several times and loved it. Daughter diagnosed I with Type 1 Diabetes last year. Been to Dollywood and Carowinds, both gave us a sheet to take around to attractions where we would be given a time to return to keep her from standing in long lines. Thought it would be same at The Magical Place on Earth. Stood in line at first services to be told no, Disbetes is not a disability they recognize at Disney. Was asked how we typically manage blood sugar, explained process of counting carbs and injecting insulin. Was told too just give more insulin. Was told standing in line would be good for her. Spoke to supervisor and given same bad info. I also called Disney dining ahead of time and made reservations. I was told the chefs could help us with carb counts. Our chef looked at me like I was speaking a different language. Thet turned it I to a challenging vacation where my daughter was exhausted by 2 each day so we left the park.","Negative"
"We travelled here for the halloween party which wasn't a disappointment. We were at disneyland for 4 days which we found was just long enough to fit everything we wanted to do in, there was plenty other stuff to do we could have spent longer there. The disney parades and disney dreams light show was amazing and lived up to what I had been told before we went. All the staff were friendly and helpful. One of our highlights were meeting the characters who made a effort and tried there best to see everyone in the time they had. We didn't have any bad experiences. The halloween party was really good which kept the park open till 01:00 in the morning with rides staying open and buzz and other characters being the dj. With staying in a disneyland hotel the parks open at 8:00 instead of 10:00 for people who aren't I the hotels which allows you to get on bigger rides with smaller queues.","Positive"
"Just arrived at Disneyland Paris. We are a family of 7 with 4 small children. Hotel   fine and friendly. Ventured in to the park to get something to eat. We are in the self service pizza restaurant. We have been standing in a queue for 45 minutes and we are still 10 from the front! They have just 2 tills open out of a total of 10 available. The supervisor Valerie is embarrassed and apologetic but explained that this is the best she can do with the people she has available. I'm not sure whether she means quantity, quality or both. There is zero evidence of management let alone leadership. Whoever is heading up this part of the Disney operation needs either to 1. Be fired or 2. Have a strong word with themself. There are thousands of catering establishments around the world to learn how to serve delicious food quickly and efficiently (for example ski resorts, airports, Eataly). I suggest someone from Disneyland Paris urgently gets themselves on a research mission or recruits an expert. We are now 3 from the front of the queue. I hope the food is better than the service!","Negative"
"We visited a few years ago and had fond memories. Yesterday was just lines.Has Disney run out money that they need the full the place with people so there are endless lines.Place opens to the public at 10:00. We were there just before with pre bought tickets.First attraction we lined up at 10:10 and it was an 80 minutes wait.Would not recommend to anyone till Disney sort themselves out.Don't waste your time. There are much better places to go, spend time and money (very expensive for what you get in return, lines...)","Negative"
"Nice park, littered with cigarette butts, its like London but made by disney,most of the rides and food places where cold, half the staff were pretty rude and just wanted to get you out the wayQueues were horrific even for disney, some of the staff where greatKids love the characters they are fantastic and so good with childrenBut for what you get and what you'll end up paying on food hotels etc your better off paying a little extra and going to florida.Harder and longer but much more worth itAlso getting pushed out the way by Spanish people everywhere does tend to get on your nerves...","Positive"
"Coming from a person who has been to Disney Land more than ten times, Epicot more than 3 times, and Animal Kingdom once; this park was horrifically horrible. This was not a theme park built with the intention of you going to have fun time on roller coaster and playing games. This was a park built only to have you spend money because the entry way was a line of stores. The rides, there are very few and they were not anywhere near the caliber of the rides in the states. No one would go to the parks In Florida and California with those rides. The characters were barely there, you would wait in line to take a photo, and the courtesy wasn   t even there to inform you that someone would be the last or that the character was leaving. The colors of the costumes are drab; the staff people were not friendly. It just left a sour taste in your mouth. If you have never been to a Disney amusement park you might think this park is ok or wonder why people enjoy going to the park multiple times. If you have been to a Disney Park and are one of those people who want to visit each and every one of the parks, skip this one! I usually go to the park when it open and stays until it closes but I was in and out in less than 3 hours!","Negative"
"Bought a combo ticket for 2 days. Well worth due to new attractions like ironman and toy story. 2 days is still not enough especially with kids. There were long que especially after lunch. Advisable to be there early. Not much difference whether you visit weekday or weekend. ","Positive"
"As my title says...Last year my family and I went to DisneyWorld in Orlando and we just recently got back from our 10 day Disneyland trip and, sadly, I gotta say, it has seen better days. Everything seemed dated and worn out. At least 6 major rides were closed and while we were there the Haunted Mansion broke down and the main Disney Train that goes around the outside of the park broke down. The traffic inside and outside the park was unbearable. An hour and a half to drive 2 blocks and the crowds were crazy so they rope off the center of the walkway and if you want to get to the other side you have to walk all the way to the other end and make your way back and this was in February.When we first got there and started walking down main street...the wife and I looked at each other and said.... Is that really the Castle  It is so small compared to DisneyWorld.I realize that this was the very first Disney and I appreciate it for what it is was...If you are going to Disney for the first time, you will probably enjoy it....but if you have a choice, you will get better dollar value and a better experience if you go to DisneyWorld in Orlando.","Neutral"
"This was my first time going to a disneyland and I never expected it to be that bad. Firstly, HKD is way too overcrowded and they don't limit the amount of visitors there is a day, I believe that 200 people should be the maximum since I only went to a couple of rides: space mountain ( fast track ticket ) , Buzz lightyear astro blasters, jungle river cruise, Autopia, It's a small world, stitch encounter and slinky dog spin. For me, the stitch encounter and the slinky dog spin was the worst because the stitch encounter was basically watching Stitch talk and having a chance of talking to him ( on screen, for children ) and I thought it was a ride, the que was horribly long ( 1 hour on a hot day ) The slinky dog ride was very bad either, 45  minute que to go on a dog ride ( 3 4 laps of a a circle ) which made the ride less than 1 hour. However, I do recommend Autopia, space mountain, astro blastersand the jungle river cruise. On the other hand, the food there was disgusting and dry which costed 98 hong kong dollars ( equivilent to   9.80 uk money ) What a rip off       . The staff had bad manners, the one i experienced was the one in the jungle river cruise. Somehow, they show disrespect to mainland China people since my family and I split the group in half because half of us wanted to rest and half of us wanted to go on rides, so they found a ride and they called us to go and when we reached there they didn't let us through since they thought we were que cutting but my family was at the front of the que and they were talking disrespectfully to my uncle as his first language is mandarin but his cantonese is good. But, when my mum came and spoke cantonese they went silent and let us through. Here we can the see the discrimination between hongkongese and chinese mainlanders. Also, people from south west china have better manners than mainlanders so I don't understand why they think we are mainlanders. Im from the UK and find this a rasict. In conclusion, I found HKD terrible, I do not reccomend HKD to people because of the overcrowded visitors. The positive thing about this trip is that you get to watch the 9:00pm fireworks and get to LEARN YOUR LESSON. The park opens at 8:00 or 9:00 and closes at 10:00 but when my family arrived, there were a bunch of people already there. Also, be careful since you are at risk of having your children lost. From a review of a teenager from the UK.","Negative"
"This is our second year doing the Disney Family 5K Fun Run. It is a great activity for families who love Disneyland and want to experience a different aspect. We visited the day before, got up and ran the 5K, went back to the park for the next two days. You would expect it to be crowded over the Labor Day weekend, but surprisingly it was only crowded on Saturday. Friday and Sunday were perfect, lines were short and it ended up being a perfect weekend. This is now a family tradition, maybe next year we'll try the half marathon (walking not running :)","Positive"
"Seems the cast members at the park are not enjoying their jobs as they used to?? We have visited Disneyland almost every other year since we were children (and now have our own kids) and the service was always  magical , however, in this last visit, there seems to be an obvious change. Cast members were not as friendly or helpful. In fact at times, they were not friendly to the park goers... at lines for the rides, some cast members just wave people along without saying anything (not even a hello) or at the parade, cast members were yelling at guests to move (like, yelling in a rude manner). Maybe it was the heat?? We visited Disney World in Florida last year and the cast members there are still the authentic Disney magic type who greet everyone with a smile and are helpful all around. Sad to see the original Disneyland may be losing its magic. Hopefully, this was a one off. Its not just the rides and attractions that make the visit, the way guests are treated by staff makes a world of difference.","Neutral"
"We had already pre booked our tickets which was handy as I saved 17    each pp and also saved us queuing up.park doesnt open until 10am and if it does then the rides are not open. Toilets are far and few between and hidden.also drinking fountains were very hard find. Not enough shade for kids ,food and drink very over priced no cheap alternative s unless u leave the park (basically mc donalds food).fast track was really good and saved us alot of time as we did other things and then went back, buzz lighter ride was good ,parade and night show was awesome! Highly recommend that.","Positive"
"We have no kids  we are big kids  even so , this side of the park is very geared towards little kids. Lots of kiddie rides and princess hoopla, etc. We are grateful that we went 5 Dec 9 Dec. We hardly had to wait for anything. 15 minutes was the longest due to not a ton of people and FAST PASSES. Seriously  BEST time of year to go. Our favorite thing was the Jedi Training Camp; it was the cutest thing ever and very well done. Even though we don't have kids, we almost went back to see it again, because it was so entertaining! The main guy was charismatic and funny. Our favorite ride was Star Tours  that was pretty fun, we went twice and got a different  adventure.  I learned later there are 54 different ones. We did one where we almost fell into a snowy mountain gorge and one with a pod race...well done! (I always wanted to know what it would be like to be in a pod race! ;) )","Neutral"
"As Disney fans we had to go to Hong Kong Disneyland to see how it compared to the others we have visited. It was so quiet compared to WDW in Florida, walking straight onto rides. Indeed many rides only opened an hour after the park opened. It was clean and just like WDW. It isn't as big as WDW and there is only 1 park but is definitely better than Paris.","Positive"
"We were so disappointed with Disney.  Just one big line (queue) designed to force everyone to spend as much time (and therefore money) in the park.  Walt would feel let down.","Negative"
"Everyone complains about this place not being like Disney in Orlando. It isn't, and it's not supposed to be. If you want Disney like in Orlando, you should head there. This is very quaint and cute. The rides were decent enough. Restaurants were decent as well. great light and water show in the evenings at the magic palace. Kids were thrilled to see that. We had just been to Disney Orlando in Fall 2011 and my kids didn't once mentioned that Disney Paris wasn't as cool Disney Orlando. Don't think they even noticed.","Positive"
"Best place on earth, we had so much fun our dreams finally came true.  Lots to see & fun to be had for any age group.","Positive"

"We visited DLP over 4 days in August 2013 with 3 boys aged 14, 12 and 5. The boys enjoyed the rides immensely although due to time constraints caused by long queues we didn't quite manage to get on all the ones they wanted to.The whole experience was hard work as the park opens at 10am and closes at 11pm, and at this time of year the queues are long for every ride. Expect to walk long distances, and be on your feet a lot. The advertised wait times are consistently over 60 minutes (and occasionally 2 hours !) for most of the popular rides, and we discovered that the advertised times were a guide only as often we had to wait even longer.With hindsight we could have had a more productive visit if we had planned our days out with military precision and used the fast pass system more.The other shock to the system was the price of everything. Over 3 Euro for a bottle of coke and a hot dog costs nearly 7 Euro. We at at a couple of restaurants in Disney Village and it works out at around 35 Euro a head for a main course, dessert plus a soft drink. With a bit of planning you could get stuff cheaper from the supermarket and take it in but technically, you aren't supposed to take picnics in with you and we were on holiday so opted to buy food on site.Stayed at Davy Crocketts ranch which absolutely fine, only about 10 mins away from the DLP site.Overall, we felt the sheer number of people they let into the park really lets it down. It means the queues are allowed to get ridiculously long and the cleanliness of the park suffers (e.g. the toilets are a disgrace). Also be warned that you won't see many characters in the park unless you queue at the designated places, and that despite the no smoking policy, loads of people ignore it and puff away in open spaces and occasionally, in the line for the ride ! We last visited in May 2006 and at that time of year it was much less busy and a much more enjoyable experience.","Negative"
"We took our 3.5 year old for the first time. We booked a three day pass with one park per day. We did not book the MaxPass on any day, and I   m glad. She was only able to ride the little kid rides, and it wouldn   t have been worth it. Our daughter is shy, but after the first day wanted to meet all of the characters. This was surprising to us, so I would advise you to be flexible with your plans. We did two days in the Magic Kingdom Park, and one day in California Adventure. This truly seemed like the right call for our family. The park is delightful, and there is something for everyone. I would HIGHLY advise you to read all Disney blogs you can find before you go. There are people who spent a LOT of time in Disneyland and California Adventure who have a lot of great advise. There is a blog for everything you have a question about.","Positive"
"We were very excited to be taking our young child to Disneyland Park, Paris. We had been to many theme parks and were expecting at least the same value, quality and experience. Given the price of entry to the Park, we thought that this alone reflected the quality. Unfortunately, we got none of those. First impressions are that the line to get in moved too slow. It took us almost an hour just to get in the park???!! Our first stop   bathroom. Oh Boy ... the smell was atrocious. I doubt that the plumbing was adequate to keep up with the number of tourists that visit the park. It was so disgusting that I reported it to staff   thinking that a sewerage pipe had broken. Even the staff member told me that nothing was broken, just a lot of people visit the bathroom???? Most of the rides in the park required at least a 95 minute wait and as you can imagine, young children can't wait in line that long. We went in the middle of the week; no school holidays and apparently on a  better day  than normal. Long story short, we couldn't wait to get back to Paris city away from the dreadful smells and queues. On a positive note, the grounds themselves, were very well kept & nice and green and full of flowers. In the middle of Paris City, near La Place de la Concorde, there is a little amusement park open and our child and many children we knew had more joy at this little amusement park  free entry, just pay for rides  than they did at Disneyland. Should have stayed in Paris city. But you have to try it to know.","Negative"
"I am from the 2nd most populated country in the world and yet I have never seen so many people crammed together in one place.May be It could have been a good experience had there been a limited crowd. I hated it. I strongly think there should be a limit to admitance in the park. Else there is no point visiting this place.","Negative"
"Our family visited Disneyland on 3 29. We purchased 2 day passes but decided not to return the second day. It was extremely crowded. Even with fast passes the waits were long. In 6 1 2 hours we were able to ride 4 rides. Would it kill Disney to provide some sort of entertainment while you are waiting in long lines? Maybe have some cast members visit with the children while they are in line? We saw lots of stressed out parents and children during our visit. Is Disneyland really the happiest place on earth?","Negative"
"This visit was 2 adults with no kids, so remember that as you read this. We were in and out in 3 hours and half of that was standing in line for the Nemo Submarine ride. I've been to Disney World hundreds of times, so when you see Cinderella's castle here it just seems sad. If you have kids, I'm sure you would enjoy it because of all the princesses and characters you can visit, and it's a just a good family park. I would probably go back to California Adventures before I came here again.","Neutral"
"No more to say really... This is a great park for kids and teenagers, but the overwhelming popularity along with lack of substantial skip the queue options make it quite frustrating! U will be waiting for an hour on average for most rides and on most days, and because if the sheer size, the fast pass does not help much. I have been to Paris and HK Disney, and did not find this one any better than either... Having said that, the fireworks and Fantasmic show do make the price worthwhile, as you may not have seen anything like them before... $75000 for each show of fireworks as well as each show of Fantasmic that they spend really shows! Please do not go here for a day or 2, you would probably come back dejected.","Negative"
"We visited Disneyland Paris in mid July and were surprised at how quiet the park was. Having visited here many years ago and having loved it I was a little apprehensive considering recent press and reviews stating that the park is in need of refurbishment. That is indeed the case as the park is looking a bit tired and throughout the day multiple rides broke down. We were lucky that we managed to get on the majority of the rides we had planned on and they are still loads of fun. Space Mountain especially is fantastic. The food is very much overpriced and the magic of Orlando is indeed missing here but all things aside we had an enjoyable day and were able to see the funny side of the parks shortcomings. I would hesitate recommending a visit until the park is updated. Being in my 30s and going with a friend we could manage our expectations and make the most of it but I can't help but feel sorry for families having to spend a fortune to bring their kids here and being short changed due to poor maintenance, worse food, demoralised and uncaring staff and rude patrons. Poor show, Disney. Take some of the ridiculous amount of revenue generated by Frozen and spend it on giving this park a lick of paint.","Negative"
"I would have 5 starred it except for the crowds of prams and endless kids   but it's Disneyland so I get it. My kids are 11 12 and while we all enjoyed it our preference was California Adventure Park   less crowded more thrill rides for their (and adults) liking. Flawless Disney execution and really amazing design. Easy entry and many great memories.","Positive"
"We booked to go to Paris from 12th 14th, arriving in the morning and flying home in the evening so we had 3 full days at the parks. We also booked the half board meal plan, so we did not have to worry about searching for somewhere to eat our evening meals. Things started to go wrong once we got to the hotel, where we discovered work was being done on our lodge, right outside our bedroom window, the workmen   s faces were right at our window, so we felt we had no privacy. The keys given to us were very temperamental and at one point we were locked outside our room for over half an hour, eventually we were given new keys. The bath and shower did not work, so we were unable to bath shower the whole time we were there, which was very uncomfortable and there were no drinks facilities or anywhere to store cold drinks either. I have never been in a hotel that does not offer either a fridge or kettle, and for the amount it costs to stay at Disney, to not have basics was unsatisfactory. In the brochure and at the hotel it says that there are Disney channels for the children to watch in the rooms, the English Disney channel did not work in our room, much to the disappointment of our children, only the news and the information channel worked.On our second night I mentioned my thoughts to the concierge hoping that some of this may be sorted out for us, especially the bath water, however nothing was done and we received no apology from management, we were just given a booklet to fill in for internal use only asking about our stay in Disney and what we liked best.As I mentioned earlier we booked the half board menu, which I deeply regretted. In the past I had heard that the food was fantastic, I now realise that they were talking about Disney land in America! Paris may share the name Disney, however I feel that the standards are extremely miles apart. Our children did not enjoy their meals and the only fresh items on my husbands and my plate were the meat. The vegetables were either out of a tin or had previously been cooked and re heated, they were soft and soggy, the service in the hotel was good though. For the second meal we decided to eat in the Disney Village to see if the food was any better, yet another reget! We went to the Steakhouse, which looked to be of a high standard. Table booked for 9.15, seated at 9.30 and were brought our drinks at 10.10pm. The kids were served their main meal before we were even served our starter. Both our daughters left their meals, one was raw in the middle the other was just horrible to taste and when our starters arrived, Cesar salad, we were extremely let down, lettuce which was old and the leaves were brown, half a cherry tomato and parmesan shavings with a little dressing. We sat and waited ages for them to be taken away, the waiter looked at the plates and could see we were not happy and not eating but did nothing to care why? My husband and I ordered steak, as we were in a steakhouse we had thought that it should be good, how wrong we were. The waiters decided to serve the table next to us their steaks even though they had arrived much after us, they saw we were looking and not too happy so they brought two of the steaks to us, as my husband started to cut the steak, he saw it was well done, he had asked for medium rare, so the waiter took one off the next table and swapped the steaks, I cut into mine and that was not right either, again the waiter just swapped with another person on the next table, none of us could believe our eyes. As one of my daughters had not eaten any of her food, I gave her some of my steak, which she nearly choked on as it was so chewy, most of the meals were left.We then asked for desert hoping that may be edible, I asked if on my crumble I could have custard instead of ice cream, he said custard is for children and no I could not have it, even though it was available. The only item that was wholly consumed was the Ben and Jerrys ice cream, a few bread rolls and our drinks. When we went to pay for our drink and hand in our meal tickets, I tried to speak to a woman their about our meal and she just looked at me and walked away, the receipt showed the meal came to 95 euro and if I had not already pre paid I can say that I would not have paid for that shambolic meal. I prepaid   160.00 for two evening meals which I deeply regret and will think twice about it in the future. I would just like to say that my experience at Disneyland Paris was unforgettable for all the wrong reasons, it was meant to be the holiday of a lifetime, but we could not wait to get home, the service has let the Disney name down, I was hoping to come back from my holiday to have lots of great things to say however I feel that the bad far outweighed the good.The best part of the trip were the studios. I think that it should have the disney name stripped, as I am sure Disney himself would be ashamed if he took a visit there, it is awful to say we learn by mistakes, mine was a costly one, the good thing is we have some great photos!","Negative"
"There were lots of people there. The fast pass system worked well, but there were lengthy delays. There were plenty of refreshment stands, with lengthy lines waiting for service; for example it took 45 minutes to get coffee. For older people there just was not enough shaded seating to take a break. The food was horrible, cold and stodgy by the time you made it through the lines. Planet Hollywood is the place to eat; good food and service.Tips for the high tourist times; prebook your fast passes, pay attention to the main shows AND ARRIVE 2 HOURS EARLY. Be prepared for lengthy wait times by having light snacks and drinks at hand. People sit to wait and when the shows start, they stand. The shows were very good, especially the grand finale, simply spectacular.","Neutral"
"its worth getting tickets for both parks, this and Walt Disney Studios. this is the older park, still has some great rides such as big thunder mountain and Space mountain. we did all of the rides (apart from Star Tours) some quite a few times! even got on the old tugboat. its a shame there is no fast pass for Crushes Coaster, as only managed to get on that one time. we took advantage of the early opening for hotel guests (8am rather than 10am) and although a lot of the park wasn't open yet we did get to go on Peter Pan's magic flight, the tea cups, Buzz Lightyear's Lazer Blast and there is nothing like Space Mountain just after 8am in the morning! if you are staying in a Disney Hotel take advantage of the half board option and book dinners in the various restaurants around the two parks: three course meals with waiter service and not a burger in sight! we went to the Silver Spur Steakhouse and Walt's American Diner, both very good. The Diner was an oasis of calm in a busy park, and then tended to seat families with young children in one part and with older children in another, which seemed to work well for everyone, it definitely beats queueing up for junk food in busy fast food palaces...the show at the end was  pure Disney magic  and the parades are worth seeing !again the park is busy in the summer, so plan your days, take raincoats!, and use the fast pass when you can!","Positive"
"We were there for 4 days. The rides were very good but seem to break down quite often. We queued for 70 minutes at the Hollywood Tower Hotel only for it to fail and you don't get a fast pass to use when it had been repaired. The following day my youngest daughter was stuck on HyperSpaceMountain for nearly 1 hour . No explanation Apology or goodwill gesture. Thunder Mountain was closed the following day. I know things break but compared with other theme parks i have been to this one has things happening all too frequently.Food and Drink prices are ridiculous.    7.99 for a basic Hot Dog.    3.90 for a 33cl bottle of Water were 2 highlights. The merchandise is also overpriced for what it is and where it was made.","Neutral"
"We visited in May, hoping it was less people. That was clearly a bad choice, it was crowded, crowded, crowded. All attractions had waiting time 45 120 min. The park should have a maximum number of visitors, it felt like a place you just want to get away from. Endless waiting time to buy food, no chill zones to relax. We rested on a small lawn, and was asked by staff to get up and keep moving. Of course it is expensive  , but that would have been OK, if the experience was good. This was just terrible. The kids was so eager to go, but Disney had got a terrible reputation in our family after this.","Negative"
"We love love love the park. We have visited most of the Disney parks and this is our favorite. Make sure to grab a Dole Whip and the must do rides are, Indiana Jones, Pirates, and Splash Mountain. We found Matterhorn way to bumpy to enjoy.","Positive"

"Perfect for little people, our daughter is 4.5years.We went during school holidays, was really busy, but worth it. Was a super hot day so the umbrella we took was well used. Queue times for photos were lengthy (we waited 1hr20mins for minnie and mickey) as the day goes by. You can hire kids strollers. Pick this up as soon as you can. The heat and all the walking is hard on little people. Wish we had bought iceblocks earlier in the day!!!Enjoy","Positive"
"A trip in June to Disneyland and California Adventure turned out to be a bit of a let down because so much has changed there. Not the attractions or upkeep, they continue to be stellar, but the amount of people they let into the park without capping it sooner ruins the experience. Just for the record, many, many babies (not toddlers, but younger) and strollers with children under 2. The stroller situation was incredible. Not a big deal, since Disney is for children and maybe, just maybe these parents had to bring the babies along, too for the day, but I did have about 4 stroller run overs (toes) even when being careful to watch out for them. It was simply a body crush last weekend. This also meant that the crowd control people during the parades, fireworks and Fantasmic were stressed and weren't hiding it well. More irritability than I could have imagined and there wasn't a lot of support for people trying to find a place to watch things. Just herding. Might just be me, but I saw fewer families with mid age children and young teens and more teenagers on the loose together and families with babies. That got a little out of hand. Parents with babies and toddlers out until midnight and the children are screaming and the parents are upset with them (what did they expect? Maybe 9 p.m. was about all they could handle for the day). Lots and lots of spending going on (and yet prices for entrance and stores are significantly higher than three years ago  even during a recession!), as if the merchandise was something special. But the shops have stopped carrying nicer things in a lot of cases and carry cheaply made junk o ramma. Even the candy shop seemed less  hand made  and more like it came in on the truck loaded from a ship coming from China. Sigh. The good ole days are gone, folks. I don't think much is made on the site in the candy area, anyway. Maybe the carmel apples (pricey!!).The Dole Whip booth was a long crowded line from morning to closing with delays of up to an hour and more for those waiting. (Maybe they should put in a larger place for this?) We waited in line TWICE for over 45 minutes without moving more than four people so we left the line and never had the experience. Many people put one person in line for 10 or whatever so Disney, you really should stop that practice, too. Lots of young parents and teens with iphones and other smart phones filming during dark rides and ruining it for EVERYONE else so that they can take home a grainy video for who? They should ask for those to be turned off, too. One guy had his bright IPAD out and on and being held up in front of our faces during Tower of Terror in California Adventure....what??? Okay, so that's the bad stuff. The good stuff is it's Disney, we love the sweetness, the adventure land themes and the frontier areas. We get lost in nostalgia and try to forget the rest. However, creating new memories and reliving old ones are coming at a very high price these days. Disney, must you make the prices SIGNIFICANTLY higher during these hard times for everyone? And why favor the Californians more than anyone else and give them  and only them  a price break unless you buy a season's pass (which is not practical for out of state travelers)? Folks, if you go...expect mostly Californians....and some internationals, but fewer heartland people. They can't afford it. The crowd is decidedly more like Six Flags than it used to be and that's a bit of a mystery. People dropping food containers on the ground during parades and walking away. Really? There are trash cans everywhere! Employees do clean it up nicely, but wow...what has happened to polite crowds?As for Disney, they want money, money, money. They pack 'em in. And while they have mostly great customer service, they don't care about the crush in the park or the experience you're having with that crowding as much as they should. It's kind of a shame on them thing. Wealthy company trying to create more wealth out of their cash cows the theme parks.","Neutral"
"I texted my friend saying we've been at Disneyland for 6 hours and haven't riden a ride yet!First the line line for tickets,then told to line up here for a lanyard. they say hurray to each of the rides you want to ride to get a fast pass ticket. Theres a line there too. Then the rides breakdown. Then the way they hurd you in for the World of Color show is like we were a bunch of cattle. Then after waiting with the hurd for the show you don't even get a place to sit. You stand like a hurd of cattle.","Negative"
"ALLL FUNNN FUNNNN, but for sure don't miss out on the daily light and fire work to end your day. Jaw dropping fun, even for adult like me I was singing the disney movies songs. classic to new.

"Lots of Disney characters and lots of shows for the kids. A bit disappointed as we were caught in the typhoon and the park was closed early. But the kids enjoyed the shows! It was great fun. The pooh ride as well as the Toy story ride was great fun for the kids!","Positive"
"I love the Disney parks. However, on December 19, 2011, they sold too many tickets to the park. There was nowhere to just sit back and relax. There was 70 90 minute waits for rides. Even with the fast pass you waited 20 30 minutes at Indy Jones. The fast pass allotments for Space Mountain and Star Tours were all gone before we made it up that way around 2:30 p.m. Trying to view a parade was difficult at best unless you were willing to line up 90 minutes before the parade. The fireworks display cut off the castle and the sea of people was shoulder to shoulder all the way down main street to behind the christmas tree. We enjoyed Tim Burtons nightmare before Christmas at the haunted mansion.I feel they should limlt admissions so everyone is able to enjoy the attractions with a reasonable wait.","Neutral"
"over all Disney Land was basically very poor if you were looking for an adventure park experience... DL is catering for the very young.. So overall not a good experience it you are above 10 years old ... A very big let down","Neutral"
"Disneyland was fun for both adults, teens and kids in our family. With a wide range of attractions for all ages. There was one  cast member  who was not very helpful and sarcastic. However, most of the cast were friendly and nice. We had a wonderful trip and sad to say goodbye.","Positive"
"Visited for Xmas with my 3 kids, aged 1 ,2 & 4 yrs old. Waited 1h30min to do the carousel. After that waited 1hr and the Q was still at 50% and my daughter said she was tired waiting foe the flying elephants, so we left the Q. We waited 1hr to order a coffee!!!!!! Every ride had notes on saying 75min , etc waiting time!!! The worst spent    2000 for a Xmas in Disneyland and paying    300 for nothing. Very poorly managed to reduce waiting times. Disneyland you won   t see us ever again!","Negative"
"I dont normally give a  terrible  but I thought it was disgraceful that the park closed 3 hours early on the 31st October for a Halloween event that required additional payment No warning of this was given of this anywhere on the website, including when we bought the tickets and the hours were consistently given everywhere as closing at 10. I only found out when I check the park hours for that specific day The tickets were already peak price and no reduction or compensation was made. I wrote a letter of complaint and recieved no reply...great service! The terrible rating is, in part because I habe a right to a response to a well written and reasonable complaint.But the reality is generallity not good. It is true  the queues really are awful . The reason you have to wait 40 minutes an hour for a 2 minute ride is that Disney packs too many people into a park where there are simply not enough activities and rides. How people find enough to do for more than one day I do not know, even with hours spent queuing. Space Mountain shut down for most of the day and Ratatouille broke down when were on it. The unrelenting and aggressive merchandising is soul destroying  like being trapped in a huge theme shopping mall with a few over packed rides. The food is extortionate.My day was Ok I was with two teen kids so they were open minded, not demanding constant food and toys. But with little kids getting tired, bored and demanding things I think this would be unrelentingly awful and painfully expensive.My advice is very clear to people  either go completely off season (with your sandwiches packed) or go somewhere else   there is a very nice park in Netherlands that I dont want everyone to know about but I gave it 5 stars","Negative"
"I was extremely disappointed in the Disney experience which is NOTHING like the US. After waiting in line for over an hour, the cashier experienced 'technical difficulties' and we were made to queue in another line. I was accused of cutting the line and a man got physical with my 14 year old son. I then encountered more 'technical difficulties' when the restaurant I waited in line for also experienced technical difficulties and we were turned away. I then had to go to another park for lunch. At Hiperion i was told that out of 3 hamburger choices, none of them could be ordered with no cheese. My son is lactose intolerant and they finally agreed to give me a chicken sandwich with no cheese...it had cheese!We then tried getting onto Armageddon, Tower of Terror and two other rides, which all experienced  technical experiences !! We were only able to go on one ride during the entire day. NEVER AGAIN.And there were no friendly faces, no explanations and no apologies. We will never return and I truly do not recommend you invest in this experience.","Negative"
"The experience would be excellence if not for the super hot weather. We forgot to bring along sunblock and we got sunburnt after our 2nd day in Disneyland. We went on a weekday and the queue wasn't too long. There wasn't a queue at the IronMan experience when we went over in the afternoon. There wasn't a need for Fast Pass at all. It was a pity the castle was under renovations when we visited, and there were not many theatre shows. No more Golden Mickey show, and the show replacing this was closed. The best food for lunch dinner would be at the Royal Banquet Hall. The Japanese Ramen set with chicken wings is value for money!","Positive"

"The happiest place on earth   sure is : )We 5 adults (18 50) all thoroughly enjoyed Disneyland. Off season so waiting times were at the most 30 45mins. All adorning minnie mouse caps us 3 girls had a great time. A full day is required plus more. We only had a day pass but wish we got a 2 3 day pass to park hop. ","Positive"
"Family of 4 from overseas with a 3 and 9 year old.Paris Disneyland is the 2nd of the Disneylands that we have visited and while it still has the Disney Magic, in comparison to Hong Kong it is tired and in need of some TLC. Without sounding contradictory to my previous statement I understand that areas need to be closed for upgrades and changes but it was disappointing to find so many of these areas under renovation all at the same time.The fast pass system works well and can really limited the amount of lines that you need to stand in during the day.Disneyland is great for younger kids and my 3 year old loved it. She went on everything and loved every minute we were there. My 9 year old thought it was good but he was probably pushing the top end age of kids that would enjoy most of the rides without thinking it was all a bit boring. He felt that Legoland was far better.If you could only attend 1 of the two parks I would chose Disney Studios.","Neutral"
"I have been to Disneyland numerous of times and I am so disappointed as to what has come to. The prices are way too expensive. Fast pass or not, you are still waiting in line for at least 1 hour no matter what ride it is. It doesn't matter if you have kids or just adults, it's not fun for anyone. I would save up the money and go to Disney World instead.","Negative"
"Not very impressed by Disneyland Hong Kong. This park did not feel like Disney at all. Atmosphere felt so sterile and cast members were rude unhelpful and unobliging.There is lack of shad ed areas throughout park and it got very hot out there. Food outlets very average ","Neutral"
"Not being a native Californian maybe I just don't get it, but I would rather jab bamboo under my finger nails than spend another day at Disney. Fake, manicured, corporate is what I see...if this is the happiest place on earth God help us!! My sister and I took my nephews there and what I remember is lots of waiting in line, bad, overpriced, food and a few fun runs down the Matterhorn. Even the boys seemed underwhelmed; the older one said to me  Disneyland is OK, but I'd rather go to the tide pools at Crystal Cove!","Negative"
"HUGE HUGE HUGE disappointment. This should be called Disney EuroMall because it's really just a massive overpriced shopping extravaganza with a FEW real rides scattered about.Restaurants about the park that closed at 4PM!!!!! Rides that closed at 6PM!!!! Funny that the gift shops stayed open well past closing though. Enter the park after sunset and STILL pay full day admission. Venues and rides that were breaking down and or generally not open to the public. And big doses of that lovely French attitude when we inquired why things were closed. It's Disneyland Paris so I was ready for the pushing and shoving by the hoards of frog families invading the park...what I wasn't prepared for was the ridiculously overpriced food (160z Coke Zero    4.99; hot dog for    9.00, etc.).When all was said and done, we felt like we'd paid some    130 per person for the priviledge of just being able to walk inside the gates of a large Disney shopping mall. What a FAKE experience.I could almost imagine a disgusted (and cryogenically frozen) Walt Disney rolling over in his frigid grave at the shame that has been brought upon his good Disney name.","Negative"
"Visited 4 days before Christmas, and there was not a character in sight!Queues wre very long, but if you get the hang of the fast pass system, it's not bad.To see Anna & Elsa was a 4 hour queue!! To see mickey & Minnie Mouse the queue was 2 hours!!No characters walk around anymore, it's not like it used to be, so seeing the characters now is no pleasure, it used to be fun, but somehow the fun has got a bit lost along the way. It's a shame.We stayed in the disney land hotel, and that was fantastic, it's very comfortable, although its expensive.We had a meal in tha auberge de cedrillion, and that was magical, our girls got to meet 3 princesses & a prince, food was lovely service was quick and very nice.We had a meal in the silver spur steak house, service was shocking, took an hour and 10 minutes to get a drink, really poor, but when the meal eventually arrived, it was lovely, steak was cooked to perfection. We did not leave a tip tho, as the service was dreadful!The half board deal is good for the breakfast & evening meal, but the tea time treat is a poor show, a drink & a manky donut! But as everything is so expensive, we realised that it was worth having, just for the drink really!!Disney is a lovely place, but I hope it never loses its magic!!","Neutral"
"Please tell me this place isn't owned and operated by the walt disney company!! After having been a disney world annual passholder for numerous years, we decided to try out a foreign disney property on our recent trip to Europe. We were so disappointed. Major rides were down for maintenance, in what I am assuming, being summer, is prime time. Other rides were regularly  temporarily paused . We would be in a long queue, only to have the ride break down, forcing us to leave . Numerous restaurants were not open, whilst there were lines into the streets for the ones that were. Not nearly enough washrooms, most always a queue, and not looked after. For an amusement park, it would be ok...but to have the Disney name attached to it....not so much. Definitely the low point of our vacation.","Negative"
"I have been the biggest fan of Disneyland my whole life, as it was always truly a magical experience even as an adult. I was so excited weeks before to My last trip, On November 22, 2010, It was such a let down. The park obviously has cut back on services. You never in the past would have seen garbage cans overflowing. We went to the lockers and the machines wouldn't take the money or print the receipt and we could not find an attendant. Though it was cold outside the locker room was so stuffy, no air flow. First thing in the morning the bathrooms already smelled like port a potties and the sinks only have cold water in the cold of November. Apparently Disney wont pay for warm water. The worst was Cinderellas castle. The sewer smell was so overwhelming that we couldn't stand to shop in the shop and left. Nasty horrible smell. There were kids climbing tall walls by space mountain that says law suit all over it when they fall over, again no attendants. Of course the non attentive parents could care less, I just hate to see kids hurt or Disney sued. We always get shirts and other souvenirs, yet just to try and buy something was a 45 minute wait, only two registers in the store we were in. For the big bucks spent to go to the happiest place on earth, it seems now Disney has fallen into the bottom line and no longer cares about customer service. I'm sad. And lastly, we spent lots of time on main street and I never saw one Disney character except in the parade. 45  years of magic for me erased. Very very sad. Hotel, gas, food, souvenirs, in a recession, not worth it anymore. it felt like a cattle drive. It really breaks my heart that one of the places that dreams are made of is no longer that. I do want to say something positive, The shuttle bus service is great! We never had to wait coming or going and the drivers are very nice. A Big Thumbs up for them! When you wish apon a star has always been my favorite song.","Negative"
"I love Disney i do and the parks are great and had lots of fun. Only downside is that Walt Disney studios closes a lot earlier than the Disney park and everything is really expensive. Even to buy a simple pen or keyring they want at least 5 euro! Its silly. Plus i got footage of a few rats in Walt Disney studios and there is also a serious wasp problem, You cant sit on a bench anywhere without a wasp trying to get into your mouth.","Positive"
"its all a con   Pending review we have just returned from Disneyland Paris, we stayed at New York hotel on the park, it was OK, with the cost we received 8.00am entry to the park also Fasttrack passes, on the first full day we were at the park i queued for 90 minutes with my granddaughter to go on the Dumbo ride, be in mind this is a small childrens ride, for little ones to queue for 90 minutes is just not on. the ride lasted 3 minutes.on the next morning we were up with the larks to get to the park for a 8.00am start, only to find there were hardly any rides open !!!we tried to fasttrack for Thunder mountain, it took 30 mins to queue for the fasttract tickets, then when our time was given we went to the FT queue only to have to wait another 30 mins for the ride. By this time we had lost the will to live.The park has far to many customer, the queues for food were so long we could not get any so ended up with a box of popcorn.The best part of the park was the lunch with the disney crew, but the food really was not good, i had fish and chips at 19Euros and really it was 2 fish fingers, my granddaughter had a mushroom pizza which consisted of a tomato base and raw mushrooms sprinkled on top. all in all i would not recommend anyone to go to Disneyland Paris, far to expensive and far to packed not VFM at all This review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of","Negative"
"We got the two day pass and have 2 small children (age 2 1 2 and 3 months). There were plenty of things to do and we really could have done 3 days at the park. As a nursing mom of an infant I found it really nice. They have a baby care center with private nursing rooms. I loved it because my husband could take my 2 year old on a couple of rides and come back when I was done feeding our baby. There were several rides that I had the infant in our ergo carrier and rode as well. The park is clean, and the staff very friendly as you would expect from any Disney park. We thought the live show performances were pretty good, but the actors and actresses could use some work on their English pronunciation and enunciation as a lot of it was hard to understand even though they were speaking singing in English. It is worth it to stay for the night parade and firework show!","Positive"
"I am an avid Disney world fan and have been to Florida many times, so having never been to DLP before I decided to treat my partner and I to a 2 day trip. We arrived on the Eurostar service from St Pancras, the journey was comfortable, fast and convenient.We arrived at the theme park approx 12.30pm and went straight to the Disneyland Park using a 2 day hopper pass. First opinion of the park was that it seemed filled to capacity with huge amounts of crowds. We headed towards Space Mountain 2 and I noticed the whole area smelled of horrid second hand smoke. This is in stark contrast to Florida, where everything is always clean, neat and tidy. I felt that people did not really repect the parks very much, throwing cigarette butts and litter all around.The parks are small in comparison to Florida, and while I wasn't expecting it to be similar, I felt the whole thing lacked the real 'disney magic' which I feel is so evident in Florida.Staff were not friendly, no 'good morning evening' when entering the parks, ride attendants were not pleasant, staff in restaurants seemed unhappy and hurried. Food was vastly overpriced. We were served cold fries, pizza etc for only 25 euros! Bargain, don't think so!.The parade in the afternoon was ok, but there were no fireworks in the evening and we were disappointed.Overall, it was an adequate trip, but wouldn't go back. We have already booked a 3 week trip to Orlando in September 2008 and are really looking forward to it.I would just like to say that it is such a wonderful experience to visit Disneyworld in Florida. The parks are wonderfully clean, staff are fabulous and make the whole experience so memorable. Also, having just been to DLP, I must express how fabulous the people of America are when visiting their country. Everytime I have visited Florida I have encountered the most hospitable people, both staff and tourists, and I think it is this element that keep us returning time after time. They take such good care of the parks and are so respectful. It is such a shame that DLP and the people who visit do not have the same mentality. Shame on you DLP!.","Neutral"
"Having been to WDW in Florida a few times, our expectations were probably a bit too high. The weather didn't help (although even Disney can't control this), but the Parks and the Village all appears a bit tired and not as spotlessly clean as their US counterparts. The Cast Members were not as friendly as the American versions and the queues for the main attractions were very long indeed. Overall, it's fair to say that the Magic wasn't really there for us.","Neutral"
"Late review here ... Visited HK Disneyland in 2013 ,december. This place totally turns one into a kid again , with characters we once loved , colorful attractions..... The rides are awesome , suitable for people of all ages but young at heart. Children are able to enjoy most of the rides while thrill seeking people have choices such as space mountain and r racer . Although it is a relatively small theme park , but it is filled with so much fun ! A must go for Disney fans and children . Plan a whole day trip from morning to night as there are firework display at night which Is magnificent .","Positive"
"I think this place is famous because of the brand but not really the place. I think this place is a bit outdated during my time of visit. Need refurbishment in riding and the whole area. The journey from downtown to disneyland takes around 1 hour. I came a little bit late but i end up exit a few hours after that.","Neutral"
"While on a road trip my family decided to take a spontaneous trip Disneyland just a few days before Christmas. None of us had ever been before and we were so excited. Disney definitely did not disappoint. It was decorated beautifully for Christmas. Even though lines were long, they seemed to move quickly. The longest line we waited in by far was to see Mickey at his house and we waited there for close to an hour. The characters were awesome, it was so cute seeing my 4 year old interact with the princesses, Tinkerbell, Minnie. Especially Moana, she was great! My daughter love love loved It's a Small World. She was really looking forward to the Alice in Wonderland ride & the teacups, but they were both closed due to rain which was disappointing. I loved the Indiana Jones ride and Peter Pan's Flight and my husband is a huge Star Wars nerd and wanted to spend all his time in Tomorrowland. Shopping for souvenirs was fun, but I guess I was expecting more variety. I thought this would for sure be the place to find souvenirs with the lesser Disney characters like Hercules etc. but I didn't really see many outside the more popular movies. We were excited to try the food because we had heard how amazing it was. It was good, but it didn't blow my mind or anything. The churros were awesome though. The parade we watched that night was spectacular!We absolutely can't wait for next time!","Positive"
"Went to Disneyland for the first time without kids (all grown up). It was actually really fun. No rushing for things and able to really take it all in. The park has changed a lot by adding a lot of Star Wars attractions since I'd last been. There are a couple apps out there to help you really navigate rides and attractions too. Make sure and ride the classic rides as well. Pirates of the Caribbean, etc. still a really good time to be had in the park at any age.","Positive"
"I have been to Disneyland 6 times in my life at various ages and this was the first trip taking my own children. The magic has changed. Here are the challenges:Crowded. Disney has become a hangout on the weekends for the residents of OC and I totally understand that, it is in their backyard. That makes the weekend days literally packed to the point where you seriously cannot walk down the streets.Long lines. Not all rides have Fast Passes and some you would think should don't.Closed rides. We did not realize know that several major rides were closed. It's a Small World, Big Thunder Mtn, Splashdown, and finding Nemo were all closed at the same time? That left very little selection of the other popular rides which made the lines even worse.Rides breaking. It took 3 days for my parents to finally get on to Indiana Jones because ti kept breaking. I waited over 45 mins inside Indiana Jones while they tried to fix it. Pirates broken down as well while we were on it and waited 45 mins in the dark while they fixed. And Cars broke down too! It was crazy and disappointing not to mention wasted valuable vacation time to navigate the crowds and lines elsewhere.Travelling with kids and thinking you can do the switch out at the front of the line does not always work so be prepared to wait longer so everyone can do the rideNot as clean as it used to beEarly Morning entry did not include some major rides which was frustrating even though those rides are in the open sectionDid I mention long lines?Summary:I guess the condition of the park was surprising. Run down some. The staff still amazing.The food options limited due to closures. The souvenirs expensive of courseThe tourist destination feel gone (at 3 pm and all weekend the park fills with locals)The parade was great despite Cinderella's demotionI miss the gondola, the people movers, and of course not being able to show my little girls it's a Small World. Grrr We really would have reconsidered our trip had we known. We saved a ton of money to take the grandparents away for their birthdays and have our first trip to Disney as a family. So check ahead on the rides. Also go during the week. Avoid the weekends, and holidays and the afternoons when people get off work and school for a better shot at rides and less crowds.At the end of day, the girls loved it still which is all that matters but were worn out from the crowds fast. So many tired, hot, sad, crying, kids there:( and strollers everywhere! Very different if you have not been back there since the 90's like me.","Negative"
"i am writing this review for all of you who will NOT have read reviews before booking at inflated school holiday , august BANK holiday weeks , xmas etc and thinking that no one else will be going the same time and that food will be pocket money price because its DISNEYso before you all return and MOAN and moan about how its all disneys fault and they all talk french let me ask , why AFTER the event are you now on here complaining about it ?  i have been to orlando disney world 6 TIMES no where else in the world will EVER compare to there and the only reason after 12 years i have visited disney france is because my youngest 23 months is too young for the size and scale of florida , i have paid between   3000 and   10,000 for holidays in florida and have NEVER visited there either in PEAK times again those problems exist there also at peak times ( disneyworld are known to close their gates at midday on xmas day due to park being FULL ) also at florida princesses do not roam around freely they are always in a booth or station with cast members who make you queue again i know this as i have had to queue every time i have visited due to having 2 daughtersmickey mouse NEVER NEVER NEVER roams around freely it would be like elvis expecting to stroll around and no one bother himso if you are going to paris it will NEVER EVER EVER be florida and if you moan youre going instead of this park then that is youre OWN mistake NOT disneys you should again have researched yourself i am going to give points out to help users you actually want help before they go and not just use trip adviser as a springboard to moan about their mess up AND AS FOR THE PERSON BELOW WHO HAS COMENTED THAT BLACKPOOL PLEASURE BEACH IS BETTER THAN HERE ,WELL MY GOD I VISTED LAST YEAR AND ITS THE MOST HORROFIYING PLACE IN ENGLAND , NOTHING BUT DRUNKS STAG HEN DOS AND RUBBISH EVERYWHERE 1. QUEUES WILL BE HOURSSSSSSS LONG AT PEAK TIMES E.G JULY AUGUST SCHOOL HOLIDAYS ,BANK HOLIDAYS, do yourself a favour unless in is essential that you can only holday here in those times than book mid week or off peak , those off you who do , then put up and shut up or go else where as you can clearly see here it is hellllllll2 . FOOD will be sky high prices and why not , they are here to make a profit so if you wish to eat expect to pay for it if not no one is stopping you taking a lunch in , i have paid   12 for a small breakfast at manchester airport with no drinks so again it is NOT over priced just expensive 3. princesses do not walk around or many characters this is all fact and will never change4. disney only own a share of this park so again you have to give and take with the difference between here and florida5. you DO see characters if at least on the parade , but they are there just not in the same place as you in that park at that moment in time , otherwise do you think other reviews are lying when they say they have seen them so i will answer anyones questions , i know quite a bit about both here and florida and will only try and help","Positive"
"I'm a huge fan of Disneyland in California and really looked forward to Paris Disney. The parks are more geared toward restaurants than rides. The lack of beautiful landscaping (except at the entrance) was also a disappointment. I did like their version of the Haunted Mansion and the clothing stores on Main Street were nice. Overall, you get the impression the park isn't finished or they ran out of money and had to make due with faux decorations like plastic wall murals rather than real wooden structures. I think I'm a bit spoiled by the original Disneyland but would advise parents to check out the rides and what is offered carefully before purchasing those expensive tickets. No siteing of or Princesses, Mickey or any other Disney character throughout the day.","Neutral"
"If you   ve been to the    better    Disneylands in Florida and Tokyo, give this a miss. Be assured that you will be disappointed. It is small, and on top of that, a bulk of it is under renovation.  Not worth a visit.","Negative"
"We visited 31 03 to 4 04 with a 3 and 4 year old. We booked the trip over a year ago and were really excited about experiencing the Disney    magic   . However, the reality fell far short for reasons that could have been avoided.On our first day, a cast member shouted so rudely and aggressively at us for several minutes (as we   d walked the wrong way due to poor signage) that our 4 year old was reduced to tears. How any adult would behave in that manner around children is beyond me. The fact it happened at Disney a supposedly child friendly resort was astounding. When I tried to calmly explain our mistake and asked where to go he continued to verbally abuse us until another cast member came, spoke to him sharply in French, and helped us. Even after our return our daughter talks about the    nasty man on the train   , so shame on you Florian, you don   t deserve to work near children.The rides we went on were good, there were queues but that is to be expected. I did notice some of the larger rides were closed which would have been disappointing if our children had been older. Other guests we spoke to who had been before also said they were surprised by the amount of closures on the park.Whilst on the subject of queues, we queued to see Rapunzel. This took nearly 3 hours which is ridiculous and to me typified all that is wrong with DLP. We had two character dining experiences which couldn   t have been more different. Caf   Mickey, very basic food and poor service. It took nearly 2 hours to get a burger, when we complained we were told that the kitchen had messed up. I am glad that we did this though as otherwise we would only have seen the characters on parade and not met them. I was expecting to see them walking around the park but that didn   t happen. They spent time to get photos autographs at each table and given the queues to do this on the Park, it makes it worthwhile. So, I would recommend it but be prepared for a long wait. We went to the Auberge de Cendrillon for our daughter   s birthday and this meal was what made our stay. The staff, notably Salve our waiter, were brilliant. They were happy, conversational, helpful and professional just what you would expect from Disney but until then we hadn   t seen. Similarly, the princesses were great, Belle made our daughter   s day by singing happy birthday, even though she leaving to get ready for the parade. Snow White   s Prince Charming was also especially good with our young girls. Expensive but well worth it, given that we   d tried and failed twice to book at the Princess Pavillion.The evening parade was really good and had the Disney    feel    and it was only place where Frozen was represented. We were really disappointed by this, given the fact that most little girls adore Anna and Elsa. DLP must be the only place in the world where there is no Frozen frenzy! With a few tweaks, out of date attractions like Alice in Wonderland could be changed to represent the interests of this generation.So, overall the test of any theme park is would you return? In honesty, I   m not sure we will.","Negative"
"I was a bit surprised that only 1 ride was marked as scary for kids. I think there were more which are scary for kids but non of them was really scary for adults. It was weird that several rides were shut down several times a day.I liked a lot Alice in Wonderland and the submarine was really nice. I expected to find more fast rides. I had a good day in Disneyland. But as an adult I guess I will not go again. ","Neutral"

"I had 4 days to spend in HK and really wished that I hadn't wasted a whole day in Disneyland. Even thought I had my 6 year old with me, it just wasn't big or interesting enough to have spent a whole day here. Now, I've been to Orlando a few times so my expectation was high   but if you've got nothing to compare to, then it might be ok. There were no characters to be seen. The food was also terrible   I had the worse hot dog and hamburger in my life here in Disneyland HK.","Neutral"
"This is what I like to call Disneyland in Hong Kong. The smallest in the world and only good for kids and not for young adults and above. You want to have a good time, most beautiful landscape around this area. You will be amazed there are so many things you can do for free without paying and going inside the park. I go with family for picnics, enjoy the hotel laze around the lobby and use their facilities for free and have a Mickey signature ice cream which will make your day and then head for Inspiration Lake. Children can hire a bike or a boat to ride around the lake, there is a 7 11 there serving snacks and drinks so you can travel light and enjoy many things for free. The park itself is useless, too many mainlanders spoilt the entire area and the wait is too longgggggg.....","Positive"
"We went to visit Disneyland's California Adventure Park to see Cars Land and to try the Cars Land Racers ride. Each ride we good was very very short   probably to keep the lines moving. We have been to Disney World (Orlando) which felt like you were getting a little more for your money.","Neutral"
"Stayed over and went to Eurodisney, spent all day in queues managed to get on two rides, first was a maze, the second we had to put in a ticket and go back 5 hours later for the twilight zone tower of terror which is a good ride. Overall opinion, overpriced and long queues. Would have been better off at Blackpool Pleasure Beach.","Negative"
"This was my fourth visit to Disneyland Paris having been previously in 2001, 2007 and 2009 and it has always been a magical enjoyable experience, always looking forward to our next visit. We also visited the resort in Anaheim California in 2012 which was amazing. However we left feeling very disappointed after our most recent visit to Disneyland Paris.The main park now sadly seems very run down and tired, with cutbacks in the number of attractions and shows, with rides regularly breaking down. and the smoking!! I have never seen so many people smoking in a public place, even while standing in queues for rides with small children around, with no staff members enforcing the smoking policy.We always avoid the food outlets in the park which are frankly a rip off. We always take a packed lunch to snack during the day, which usually consists of rolls, croissants and other items from breakfast, and we take our own bottled water. Who wants to spend ages in a queue for junk food and fizzy drinks?We have been spoilt on previous visits with numerous parades throughout the day, including an electrical parade, shows and quality stage performances, Disney characters just wandering around the park to meet and greet you. Now there seems to be one parade a day, no live shows, and Disney characters nowhere to be seen. After about the third day having been on most of the rides we were getting bored! The only real highlight was the Disney Dreams show at the end of the day which was fantastic.The rides are still good, but again with a lack of maintenance they didn't seem as good as before. I compared a video I shot of Pirates of the Caribbean ride back in 2007 to what it was now, and half the animatronics don't seem to work any more, now just static figures. We were stuck on Autopia for some time as one of the cars broke down. We also had fast passes for Buzz Lightyear one day but missed out as it was closed due to a 'technical problem'. More of the popular rides would also benefit from having Fastpass, despite numerous visits I have still never had a chance to go on the Finding Nemo ride, always a ridiculous queue!This is a far cry from the Disney experience you get at Anaheim. That park is almost 60 years old but it feels brand new, the staff are friendly, all rides working (and if they don't work, they are closed down and fixed   not leaving people stranded). queues move quickly, and a strict smoking policy where people actually smoke in the designated areas! on another note, Anaheim has much better Parade etiquette, where people at the front sit down on the pavement, so people behind can see. Unlike Disneyland Paris with everyone standing up and pushing and shoving to get the best view, also plenty of places to sit down. I overheard one Cast Member talk about Disneyland Paris being the 'poor relation' out of all the Disney parks! Have the appropriate Disney authorities actually inspected Paris in recent years? surely there are standards that must be maintained?You expect to go to Disneyland for a magical experience and come away smiling and only feeling sad because the holiday is over. I came away feeling conned, with smelly clothes and a bad cough. cheers Disney.I hear there are plans for an upgrade to DLP in 2017 for the 25th Anniversary, such as a new Star Tours ride. This is welcome news and I hope they also factor in a major cash injection to refurbish the rest of the park and bring back more of the parades and shows.It's a pity they never built the park in Spain which I think was the original plan, it would have been far better I think and and not just because of the better weather. Building in France I think was financially motivated, shame they went with the scheme and not the dream : (","Negative"
"I visited Disneyland Paris with my girlfriend and had a great time.Being a veteran of Walt Disney World in Orlando, I was keen to go with my girlfriend to the park in Paris to share the Disney magic with her and we were mostly not disappointed.Luckily the weather was fantastic so walking around the park was not a problem. We went when the schools were in so it wasn   t too crowded. Immediately the Disney magic hits you and you are swept into the happy world. Walking down Main Street USA towards the castle really gets you excited. Some of the rides here are fantastic, Space Mountain is a great thrill ride but also one that smaller children can enjoy too, also I have to mention Pirates of the Caribbean. It is so well done, the environment is completely immersive and makes you feel like you are in amongst a pirate battle. This is better than the version in Florida.Some of the attractions are not so great though, Star Tours is incredibly hard to enjoy as there is no English translation on the ride which left my girlfriend pretty confused as to what the story was. Also the Mad Hatters tea party was way too short.Also we were pretty disappointed as Thunder Mountain and Indiana Jones were both not operating the day we visited. This was not good as we were looking forward to riding them as they are some of the only thrill rides in the park.Despite these issues the park is still great. There is so much detail everywhere. For example I suggest you take a walk under the castle, not a lot of people will but those that do will be met with a warm surprise.Food at the park is alright, we ate in the restaurant next to the Pinocchio attraction. We both had burgers which were ok but not great although the fries were superb. Disneyland is a fantastic experience and I think most children will love it. Older children and adults who haven   t grown out of theme parks will enjoy it although a few more thrill rides would be a welcome addition.","Positive"
"I had previous wonderful experiences there, but there were soooo many people that you could hardly move, could not enjoy anything wonderful there. Disneyland is probably only after the all important buck, instead of enjoyment for their Customers. Numerous rides broke and when they reopened there was only one or two employees to control the Kaos for the line. We even had the Fast Pass equipment break. My family and I may never go back and that is a shame!","Negative"
"Disneyland is at its best at Christmas. The two go together like peanut butter and jelly. The only drawback is the mass of humanity, but it is still wonderful.","Positive"
"can't write enough about how magical the entire park is. you can easily spend a couple of days here and not get bored. For kids and adults alike, it's a magical experience. The movie with the Disney characters was awesome and so were the rides. Just remember to wear comfortable footwear.","Positive"
"WOW. Is all I can say. I had never been before but my girlfriend had been 7 times before so she knew what was coming and kept telling me how awesome it was. When I first stepped into the park I instantly felt the magic of the place, Do be prepared for a lot of queuing (longest I queued was 40 minutes) but believe me it is so worth it. The Magic of Disney parade and the Disney dreams fireworks put the cherry onto of the cake for me. A fantastic time.","Positive"
"Someone is smoking inside the toilet. Inconsiderate tourists rudely cut in somewhere in the middle of the queue (it happens multiple times). My 3 year old Daughter is not happy because of the long queues. We ended going back to hotel early and decide not to complete all rides.Majority of tourists are inconsiderate! Management should do something.","Negative"
"Was expecting more from Disney several of the best rides were shut down the day we went. I can see why they are going to spent several million dollars to update.","Neutral"
"This review is for Disneyland Park itself, not the whole resort. I will remember my visit for the things here you will not find anywhere else this side of the Atlantic, mainly the parade and the evening spectacular. The park is worth visiting for anyone who has been touched by Disney. You will feel like you have stepped into a different world!But it is not a 5 5 experience. There are a number of attractions that are dated by modern standards and feel distinctly 1990s, breaking the immersion on occasion. These would benefit from the introduction of new technologies and creative ideas. Make sure you take your own food and drink, as the options in the park are a massive rip off too.","Positive"
"We rode lots of rides. Characters are really popular so check out the Disney App to help find them. I highly recommend the App. It will save you lots of time walking around. We found it to be very accurate in all situations but one. At one time it said Pirates of the Caribbean was  temporarily closed.  We stayed in line anyway since the line was moving. It wasn't closed. There were lots of temporary closures at various attractions. Indiana Jones seemed to have more than it's share. Food and drinks are pricey. We heard you couldn't bring in drinks but the second and third day we brought drinks (couldn't stomach paying $3 for water too many times) and they didn't say anything. We refilled our water bottles from the water fountains. We got a one hour early entry  Magic Morning  with our 3 day pass (not to be confused with the  extra hour  for CA Adventure   they aren't interchangeable  we found out the hard way) which was great for getting some extra rides. They only had part of the park open so the lines in those parts were almost as long on some rides as during normal hours but not quite. And we got our first Fast Pass right at 8 am (for 8:40 ride time).","Positive"
"Just okay. Had fun, but I enjoyed HK other than this attraction. Yep     looong queue. So you better prep up some energy to be ready for this in exchange for 1   3 minutes ride.","Neutral"
"I would never have gone in July if it had not been for a reunion with my BFF from high school. I felt the park capacity was way past the danger level.. Does greed trump safety??? I guess so... Plus unless you stake out a claim on a piece of sidewalk, there is no viewing room to watch the Paint The Night parade. People place clothes, towels, blankets, bags, just about anything to save a spot, then they are off doing whatever, then get all ticked off when they come back and find others are standing too close to  their spot ! It's ludicrous and so not worth the stress and tension. If you do choose to go in the summer and during the 60th celebration, I suggest you plan minimum of three days, otherwise I doubt you will be able to do even half of the attractions. I will return during the off season and after the 60th.. Good luck to you all...","Neutral"
"The French think they own the place, the main goal of Disneyland Paris is to part you with your money, The whole place is just a total rip off and sub standard compared to the Florida park.","Negative"
"Having been to Disneyland in Anaheim, Hong Kong's Disneyland is the exact same magical place.  Wonderful for children and adults.  There is something to make everyone smile and feel happy.  Certainly recommend it if you have a day night spare in Honkers.","Positive"
"Plede read this review in the context of someone who has been to most of the Disney parks! Paris great and very beautiful but it lacks some of the special detail that you really notice at other Disney parks like their brilliant queue management systems and long queue distraction systems. On the day we went at least 2 major rides were closed for several hours due to technical issues. I also found this park much more pitched at the under 10's. having said all this I think that if you have never had a Disneyland experience then it is a must do!","Neutral"
"We have been to Hong Kong and Disneyland on a number of occasions. This time however we had taken the Grandchildren with us, both boys aged 6 and 8. They had a wonderful day and during the afternoon Halloween Parade they were invited to take part, however they decided to decline as they are a bit shy. The parade was very well performed. Disneyland Hong Kong can at a push be done in a day. It is one of the smaller Disney global sites, however, what it lacks in size is made up for in atmosphere. It   s a great park and well worth a visit during your stay in Hong Kong. The MTR (mass transit railway) is the easiest way to get to the site. The journey takes about 40 mins from Mongkok.","Positive"
"Hong Kong Disneyland is the smallest Disneyland in the world. As a lot of areas are used as hotels, it doesn't provide any wow factor. The queue for the rides is extremely long. So if you love trying different rides, you had better go there early in the morning. Shanghai Disneyland will be open in future which might provide a better alternative.","Neutral"
"Was a bit disappointed   I expected it to be a bit larger and merrier. The staff was very unfriendly and kept pushing the crowd to one side, hours before the parade was to start. The staff managing the characters allowed people to take too much time taking photos. The lines were long and not moving. A lot of construction was taking place. The restaurants were too pricey and limited variety. The best was the ' Lion King'. It was an excellent production.","Neutral"
"We specifically went to Disneyland to ride Indiana Jones as it's not in Disney World. Right before we went on, it broke. They gave us a fast pass to use it later in the day. It was never repaired. Sleeping Beauty Castle was closed off because they were filming Americas Funniest Home Videos. The Matterhorn was still being repaired since January. We complained about our Indiana Jones experience specifically as we knew it would be closed for repairs starting on Monday (we went on the Friday before). The cast member said she can give us a fast pass for indiana jones for the next time we come to the park as compensation. I thought this was a joke and we were on Americas Funniest Home Videos. I told her it could be 10 years if ever we return to Disneyland as we frequent Disney World. Her answer to that was no problem, it will still be valid 10 years later. She had absolutely no customer service skills or a functioning brain. Skip this park and go to Universal Studios when in California. All of their attractions actually work, are superior and the employees went out of their way for us.","Negative"
"We've just returned from a lovely 5 days in Disneyland Paris, however I would like to point out that Space Mountain broke down whilst we were on it and were made to sit in the dark for what seemed like a very long time before they came to rescue us with no explanation. Rocky Mountain broke down after we'd queued for an hour   again no explanation but at least we were offered a fast pass after complaining. I can go on   so many of the rides broke or just closed for no reason. The characters are great but there is no organisation and everyone pushes in, my daughter queued so nicely to see many of the characters and was rewarded by a longer time with them as they can see what is going on. It is Disney but for what it cost us I would go to Florida next time   at least all the rides work and it's much better organised. We waited to see Mickey for about 20 mins when it was my daughters turn, they said he has to  pop  off but will be back in 5 mins   we waited nearly an hour as we were at the front but he didn't return   things like that take away the Disney magic especially for a 5 year old. All I would say we stayed at the Disneyland Hotel and she has a private audience with all the characters every morning, that was well worth the extra effort.","Neutral"
"Our 3rd visit to Disneyland Paris (just for a day) was the most disappointing one of all. We arrived one hour before official opening time, and when they did eventually let us in, the park was under construction in many areas, with several of the rides (Indiana Jones and Aladdin for example) closed. Big Thunder railroad was also  broken  when we tried to use it, but it eventually opened around noon. I really don't know why they can't do heavy maintenance or redesign work in winter instead of during peak times.My family and I are big Disney fans, but I'm not sure what's going on with this park any more. Cast members are surlier and more unhelpful than ever, food is a total rip off and customer service is something that's only written somewhere in an employee handbook, because it's certainly not being practiced.Magical?   definitely not as far as I am concerned, but maybe they were just having a bad day when we called......","Negative"
"Disappointed to say the least with most of Tomorrow land closed for refurbishment. Not only that but a lot of food outlets were closed as well it was even a challenge to get a drink of water.Take a ride on the train to have a look around only to discover it's just a half journey you disembark and queue again, not that you would bother you only see the fence and trees!If you want to see fireworks go to river fire in Brisbane where Movie world and Dreamworld are better attractions.","Negative"
"If you really want to go, go.But you should know beforehand:1   there is no respect: people smoke in the entire park, although there are areas designated for that. Peolple smoke in the lines, in the face of children(including yours) with that blas   face. The employees did not see it (there are few, comparing to USA). When they do, they do nothing about it, or just do not care.2   People usually cut line. Yep, it is true( I saw a lot of this complaints here in Tripadvisor) .You have to be paranoid in a vigil to prevent this to happen. The staff do nothing as well.3   There are many (not all of course) rude employees. Very rude.4   it is very disorganized. The fastpass not exist in some attractions, and in others there are only few of them.5 the food is expensive (but this is not what bothers me at most)In summary: It is not Disney. Disney means joy, respect, a place for children and adults that go to the park with good intentions, respecting others and with a good spirit. Is not what happens here.I suggest a few things: the first, and best : save your money and go to the U.S., which is the real Disney (can be Orlando or California). The second: if you live in Europe and can not go to the U.S., but really want to go  Disney , be prepared....Paris is such a wonderful city, so do not waist your time here!","Negative"
"It's too small for the summer crowds. Like what others said, you do end up wasting 30 40 minutes waiting for pretty much everything. Customer service doesn't exist. Crowds are rude. If you want to pay to wander around and just look at things Disney, come on in. If you're expecting a true Disney experience, head to LA or Orlando.","Negative"
"Spent a day with my family (7 adults and 4 young kids) at Disney Paris. The entrance and setting were very promising and we were very excited about this day. The rest was a nightmare ! Many major attractions were closed for renovations. For other attractions (Peter Penn, Pinoccio, Disney train) we waited over 40 minutes and then were told that due to technnical problems we should come back later. When we came back later, these attractions were closed ! You can imagine the disappointment of the kids (and us) waiting for nothing. Toilets were so dirty, you could not use them. We did not see anyone cleaning them during the day. Cold water and ice cream are sold only at few stands, so you had to wait 15 minutes in cues for water each time (it was a very hot day). But the most terrible experience was lunch. Most of the restaruants were closed, leaving one fast food place open to serve thousands of visitors. We stood up in line for lunch 2 hours !!! I repeat, 2 hours !, in a crowded stinky stuffy room with over 500 people, attended by 8 slow, inefficient and indifferent staff. Then we had to eat sitting on the floor outside, as no available chairs and tables. EUR 150 just for nuggets fries cokes and starving annoyed kids. What a day. It seems all they care about was making more money after selling you the very expensive entrance ticket. We stood in a que of 50 minutes just to have our picture taken with Mickey, and then paid EUR 10 for each picture. The que for taking a picture with a princess figure was 90 minutes long. No one seems to run this place, or make sure people actually enjoy it. We left early, and swore never to come back again.","Negative"
"Highlights of this trip have to be the Light show and the various parades. A few improvements are needed. Children aged between 3 & 10 should not be made to queue in the hot sun to see a princess. A parent told me she queued for 2 hours!! We gave up and on the second day made sure we were there early!! In such a huge park, the characters should be walking around a bit more & there could be 2  3 sites where you can meet a princess ie have your photo taken. Some of the rides were not open and a few had  technical problems  so after queuing for over an hour we couldn't use. There is little communication between both parks, so you have to keep walking back and forth   say if a ride in one park is not working and you want to use that time to queue for another ride in the other park. The attendants were not very helpful. Also, we had breakfast with Mickey   kids got to see the characters, but really disappointed with the restaurant and the staff. Thought that everybody in Disney was supposed to have a smile on their face? Do we really need to have full view of a functioning kitchen? For the price, this could be better. So all in all, kids still loved it, but a bit of updating needed to make the experience efficient and inviting for parents!","Neutral"
"We saw zero characters while we were in Disney on Sunday. Pirates was closed, we waited 75minutes in the Hyperspace Mountain line and then were told that the ride had some sort of an issue and we could either wait if we wanted, or stay knowing that there was no foreseeable time frame of the ride being fixed. We waited for 23 minutes and were told by the crew member that they were back up. Everyone cheered and then 2 minutes later a woman came on the intercom and said the ride was still down. So, we decided to ditch and get food since we had a kid in tow. So about 100 minutes waiting on a ride that the Disney App said 50min. Dunno why Peter Pan's ride has such a ludicrous wait time. Saw a couple celebrities on Dumbo which was cool. Fast Passes were super beneficial for Haunted Mansion. Really what can be said that people don't already know. DON'T go on Peter Pan, get the FP for Hyperspace MTN early. Parade of Lights was ok. The kid loved it. People started getting seating spots 5 hours ahead of time. The staff tried to kick us out of the waiting area while we were looking for seating 2 hours prior to the show saying they were full. We squeezed in behind a couple generous Europeans. 30 minutes before the show AFTER they told everyone to go away and wait for the 10:30 show, they tell everyone to move forward to make more room. Sooooo.......don't listen to the staff. Disney is Disney, everyone knows about the waits. But, we went on 5 rides in a full day even with utilizing the FP system. Not worth the price of entry. Not even close. Disney has their marketing down pat. The park sucks other than to get people's wallets open and to wait ridiculous amounts of time to ride mediocre outdated 1 minute long rides.","Neutral"
"Everyone always talk about how amazing it would be to go to Disneyland. I wish I didn   t waste my money. $280 to line up for an hour for each ride? It would probably be better with kids to take them on rides but as an adult I wouldn   t bother. ","Negative"
"Our family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids aged 11 and 9) really enjoyed ourselves there. We did a lot of research on the Euro Disney website and by reading other Trip Advisor reviews before we left NZ. Even though we arrived at am on a Friday morning, we had ridden on most of the big rides on the first day and then hit the balance over the next 2 days. 3 days long enough to do everything. Very clean grounds, very organised and staff very friendly. We were there over a weekend in the August holidays, so had to be prepared for crowds and long queues, but because we were already well advised, we knew what to do first and where to go etc. Take a lot of Euros and soak it up!","Positive"
"3 time to visit Disneyland, and the worse. Yes there was new attraction, Toy story and Gizzly, an there were very crowed, as the is no space in there Disneyland. This time there was dirt all over in restaurant and the cleaner just stand and look at it with out doing something. I also miss some display in the park where you can see the time to the attraction","Negative"
"To be in the park is a pleasure due the atmosphere. However there are a lot of facilities needs maintenance and an upgrade on technology to impress the guests. We were in the thunder mountain the car was broken and after 40 minutes in the queue we left without ride and without fast pass to comeback( I asked but no success). I had been in Hong Kong and USA Disney, for sure Paris Disney need an upgrade.","Neutral"
"I'm a bit disappointed with my Disneyland trip this year because the castle and Main Street train station were under construction, and they closed the Buzz Lightyear Astroblasters ride, which was so much fun (despite it conking out more often).","Neutral"
"I would like to share my very disappointing experience at Disneyland Paris .From a young child I had always wanted to go to Disney ,to experience the magic , to meet the characters etc .So I saved to take my youngest daughter for her 10th birthday as you can imagine she was so excited .Early Saturday morning we set off from home with expectations of a truly wonderous experience ahead of us .Sadly that is not what we experienced ,as a mother whose child   s only birthday present was to go to Disneyland Paris I felt so very disappointed and sad for my little girl who was left absolutely heart broken .My parents who live in Cyprus travelled to the UK to be able to share this experience with their Granddaughter ,so this was not a cheap undertaking on our behalf and we did at least expect some value for money .So we all bought fast passes to allow us to get on the rides with a minimum wait time as my father has trouble standing for long periods and we had a Drs letter to back this up . However when we tried to use the fastpass there was no rides available until 17.00hrs which meant we were unable to go on any rides for over a 4 hour wait . There was a whole variety of rides closed which meant the ones that were working had over 1.5hr queues as all the people were concentrated on the rides that did work if you queued as there was no Fastpass available . Things closed even ran to basics like restaurants and toilets , trying to get lunch took over an hour queuing and the chose of places to eat limited in the park .All the adverts advertising Disney show the characters wandering around and interacting with the children , there was none of this which I feel is a misrepresentation of what you are actually purchasing, after all you are purchasing the Disney experience not just a theme park with rides. I do not need to travel to France to go to one of those .I did see two meet and greets with Donald and Pluto however we went to see Mickey mouse but he was not too be found . We did see Cinderella however, she rushed past not speaking to any one , was clearly in a hurry and it was not even midnight .We ended up leaving the park with an absolutely sobbing young girl whose magical dreams had been so badly broken . My Daughter Charlotte did not get to go on any rides , she didn   t get to see any of the characters other that what I have explained above ,and her dreams of Disneyland are shattered .My husband has been to Disneyland Florida and although there are queues , which are to be expected we realise that .His experience was so much better , parades 3 x a day ,characters available to meet and pictures that can be taken , rides working and so on .This new fastpass system of being able to book your rides in advance needs addressing as it clearly isn   t working for everyone or people with a day ticket .I feel that I should share this absolutely terrible experience as I would hate for other children to go through what my little girl did . This experience happened on Saturday 12 1 2019 . It also appears to me that you ONLY get the Disney experience if you stay in the Disney hotels ,otherwise no one appears to care that you are not getting what you pay for , this is something I also think should be made very clear from the start .Disney is a brand after all that is only as good as the people who are buying in to the magical dream , buying the merchandise ,going to the films. We the people who do that, should at least get the experience that we have paid for .Its like if you went to a Jeweller and paid for a diamond and was given coal .This is all such a great shame as so many people hold Disney on such a pedestal .I also have sent my complaint to Disneyland Paris guest relations on the 14 1 2019 ,i am yet to recieve a reply or acknowlegedement of my email .I would not recommend this park .","Negative"
"It's a shame to write this but the terrible service by half the staff at Disney Paris really spoilt my recent trip there. Some were ok but the vast majority were unhelpful, rude, and very unwilling to speak English. Save yourself the trouble definitely goto Disney La or Florida, the states do Disney as it was meant to be. Big mistake putting Disney in Paris should have been the Uk.","Negative"
"The 5 of us, have been to Disney on Tuesday, the first week of April 2015.A nightmare   that is the 1st thing comes to my mind.This park is just not prepared to accommodate all those people paying so much to go there and definitely expect and deserve much more than that.I   ve seen it with my own eyes. 120 minutes waiting line and people actually waiting for 2 hours (mostly exposed to the hitting sun)!.Space Mountain got jammed twice, Mattorhorn and Peter Pan were closed for refurbishing We   ve been to Disney in Paris and all 4 theme parks in Orlando. We were expecting it to be just as great, but were absolutely disappointed.","Negative"
"We visited end of September, this was my third visit. We stayed in hotel New York which was fine (good location, good quality and not as expensive as the Disney Hotel)Most of the rides were open and because it was after season and not during school holidays it was not busy.. no waiting lines does add to the fun ; )However, half the restaurants were closed and the remaining half all had a similar menu.. burgers or chicken with fries.. Doesn't seem difficult to make one would think still at every location it seems there were new kitchen crew trying to figure out how to do it the first time. Every single lunch we had was bad... The wide spread stores are all well kept (much better than the attractions) but they are all selling the same stuff. Unfortunately one can see that Disney is saving on maintenance... all the attractions look worse and worse.. also the staff gets worse... only a few are truly 'cast members' playing their part but most are uninterested and apparently in a bad mood... a far cry from what you get in California or Florida.No wonder they are in financial problems as it is all just too 'french' (bad maintenance, bad service, rude and or uninterested). Also French as main (and sometimes only) language takes away it's European appeal.. It is about time that Disney takes control and puts in place American management.However; one absolutely awesome attraction is the evening laser show at the castle. Magnificent!! As an adult I was blown away and I can only imagine the impression this would make on kids.. Awesome!As a conclusion, Disney Paris is a great attraction park and if you have the money it is still a must visit especially with kids. But it has become a faded shadow of the parks in Florida and California which is sad to see.","Neutral"
"We took our two boys aged 5 and 6. They were reasonably excited, though not as ecstatic as the TV ad suggested they might be. For me the defining moment was when we were sat in a car in Autopia, queueing to get off a ride we'd already queued 40 minutes to get on. And despite valiant attempts to make the best of it both our boys had had enough by the mid afternoon on the second day and asked if we could leave. To summarise, I felt trapped in a macabre social experiment, in which every moment the Disney machine had hitherto touched my life had been part of some grand plan to manipulate every last Euro from my withering wallet. Maybe I'm no longer target market. Maybe it was the heat. Maybe I was over tired. Or just maybe paying 400 quid to queue 40 minutes each time for four minute rides in what felt like 40 degree heat is an experience to forego!","Negative"
"Visited 3 5 february. It was bitterly cold. On friday the park closed at 18:00. Got up early to get the extra hours, on saturday, only to find only 3 attractions open and nowhere to get a hot ( or cold) drink. Bear in mind it's well below freezing, so what do you do? Four goes on Buzz lightyear with zero queues! Having been to Florida I suppose I was spoilt, but no fireworks,evening light parades or shows was very disappointing.. The whole area is very expensive.    2.75 for a small coffee out of a dispensing machine or    4.75 in Starbucks for a large coffee. For the four of us   18  for 4 hot drinks. Save a few extra pennies and go back to Florida. Don't think I'll go again.","Negative"
"Watching parades is the highlight of all my visits in Disneyland. And Hong Kong's Paint the Night LED parade beat them all! It's the best parade of Disney I have ever witnessed, or you can say the best parade yet I have seen! The parade starts at 7:45 p.m. but people would start positioning themselves on the parade route as early as 7:00 pm. We stationed ourselves along Main Street U.S.A. as the parade stops there for a few minutes and have stationary performances. (Tip, stay just right outside of the doorsteps of the stores, as you can feel the cool air coming out of the establishments during summer months, as it can be really hot even during evenings.)One parade you shouldn't miss when you visit H.K. Disney.Another great new attraction is the Mystic Manor. The ride is more than 5 mins and they have spectacular visuals!During our visit, they are constructing a new attraction Iron Man which will open in 2016! Can't wait to go back!","Positive"
"We stayed at Red Lion Hotel, just a 10 minute walk to Disneyland.We had an enjoyable 2 days at the park with Fast Pass.Not so sure the Fast Pass is worth it as a lot of the time you have to come back in an hour or two, so sometimes was just better to queue upIt's a small world was closed which was really disappointing and a couple of other things were also closed, but renovations and repairs need to be done sometime, just happened when we are there so no complaints really.Overall we still had a great time and recommend it to you","Positive"
"If you cant have fun here, then you need an attitude check. The park is clean with beautiful gardens and water features. It can be crowded, but overall is still fun to enjoy through the eyes of children and out of town guest.","Positive"
"I have been going several times a year for about 10 years. I don't live in SoCal but I travel there often. I take my now 13 year old son. The magic morning early entry used to be somewhat exclusive, but now it's almost as crowded as any other time. My son and I could ride a few rides for about the first 2 hours after the park opened, but after that, it was not worth standing in lines for hours to ride a couple rides. We spent a lot of time offsite eating out, and in our hotel watching movies. We would try to go back in the evening but it was really tough to do anything. I get the concept of the more paying customers the more money, but our time at Disneyland has finally come to an end. We are now looking for other things to do other than come to that park. That's too bad because it really is a nice park. We did enjoy our times there, so my review score is only for this trip, not cumulative. Our trips back in the late part of the last decade and the early part of this decade were terrific.","Negative"
"Overpriced compared to the attractions  located very far expensive to travel to and fro even if opt for the cheapest mode RER. Full day waste. Attractions below standard. Too many shops selling Disney merchandise at exorbitant prices. Strict NO","Negative"
"Mom trip, November 2011. Traveled for an exclusive Disneyland trip with 5 ladies in November of 2011. We had two day park hoppers and Wednesday was our first day. It was cloudy with light rain on and off but we took advantage of it. Even with growing up in Anaheim, this was the best day because of the weather and lack of crowds! Thursday we learned it was the day of filming for their annual Christmas parade so we had to plan our day carefully, steering clear of Main Street while the filming was taking place. We planned well using the fast pass and also riding during normal meal times. This way the lines were not as long for rides as well as our choices for meals. World of Color, the water light show at California Adventures is a must see and don't miss riding Tower of Terror for that  stomach drop !","Positive"
"I recommend taking a picnic as the food is literally the same everywhere, a set menu of 3 choices, of defrosted pizza, cold chips and a slice of garlic bread. The lion king restaraunt which I desperately wanted to go to was closed. It snowed which was magical though! The shops are all the same, and are awfully expensive. It was a wonderful experience though, from my boyfriend for my birthday!","Neutral"
"But not good for teenagers. It was a mistake going there. We thought it would have exhilarating rides but obviously teenagers weren't the target market here. Kids would definitely love it here, with the castle and Toy Story. But the park was rather small and we finished exploring the whole area, but obviously this is from a teenager's standpoint.","Neutral"
"surprised at the amount of technical problems just before the summer high season, the buzz lightyear ride stopped several times during the ride, we didn't even get to ride on the pirates of carribean due to a technical issue. Also the minimal number of rides that can be fastpassed. This was one of the biggest selling points and a real disappointment only about 8, you are only able to fastpass one ride at a time. Try and go on as many rides during the parades, yes there are lots of them, the queues maybe a little shorter. Food average and quite pricey which is expected in these sorts of places. The multilingual staff seem to have most languages covered. The car park staff had the huge parking lot efficiently run for    15.00 a day.","Neutral"
"Overcrowded and oversold. There is no point in putting more people in the park than it's capacity. Long wait times and endless lines. No value for money","Negative"

"A great park but why close main rides at one time To take teens and have Rock n roller coaster and big thunder mountain and star tours closed was so disappointing as one of the main reasons for the visit and no pre warning or would have deferred the visit That a side it's a magical place and we loved the other rides especially small world and space mountain The parade was magical and fireworks fantastic Staff so helpful Would have been a 5 star review if all rides were open ","Neutral"
"Disney know how to entertain whether you are young or old there is something for everyone.   Once inside your childhood is alive once more","Positive"
"Having been to California Disney many times, Hong Kong pales in comparison by far. Fewer rides, different vibe, awful food. If you have time and want to spend the money, go. Just know what you're in for. We struggled to find enough to do for 5 hours, rode a few rides multiple times even, and were done. We went in November when the weather was decent and found it warm. Cannot imagine going in the heat, let alone with children.","Negative"
"Firstly there is the entry. Suggest you buy your tickets before you go. There was a 2 hour delay when we went to buy tickets at the park and staff keep shuffling queues around opening and closing booths. Logistically they failed. There is a total lack of staff outside the gates to assist and advise many people joined queues to buy tickets only to find after long delays they could go up and enter straight away. If you have a ticket with security checks and entry to the park it   s probably 30 45 minutes. If you don   t have tickets probably 1.5 to 3 hours delay in getting in. Then once your into the park you   ll quickly notice how crowded it is. It   s only just over half the size of other Disneyland parks and you feel it in lack of places to sit and recover. Ride wait times were ridiculous when we went with most being 40 60 minutes. That means you   ll be lucky to get 5 rides into a full day. The food is as expected very expensive and massed produced poor quality food. Queues are ridiculously long for even just a soft drink or water. Save your money Paris has so much more to offer unless your into queues spending money crowds and mass produced flavorless food. ","Negative"
"I have been fortunate enough to be able to visit at least twice a year for my entire life. Everytime I visit I have such a wonderful experience. It is always going to be my choice of vacation.","Positive"
"Visited this place with little children.  Very disappointing that most of the rides and attractions were blocked or closed for renovation.  I was not told that when i booked the tickets online.","Negative"
"First, it takes a long time to get there. And the park isn't big enough that you'd want to spend more than a day there, so staying at one of their hotels to cut down the travel time isn't necessary. Second, it's super crowded. Every line is an hour long or more. It's intensely boring to stand in line one hour for something you know is going to last last than 2 minutes. Third, it's expensive. Ocean park is significantly cheaper, bigger and better. So unless you have very small children who love Disney stuff, don't go. If you do, they pump you for money at every turn. If you want your picture taken with any of the characters you have to sign up for a separate package. My only tip is if you really do go, try and get your tickets in advance. Even the lines to buy tickets there are really long.","Neutral"
"I understand cost are going up but now it cost an average family of 5 more for one day at Disneyland then it cost for them to eat for 6 weeks. Hotels have gone up, gas to get there . They are better off going to the beach.","Negative"
"i've went there for 3 times already and it is very childish. this is my opinion, but the kids would love it. so go there if you have kids. but if you are a teen or adult, i would suggest you to go to ocean park. it's much bigger and there are way more attractions.","Neutral"

"due to my husband being in a wheelchair Disneyland cater for all disabled needs. Well done to all the staff who could not do enough to help. Also the carer goes free with priority fast track to the front of the ride to save waiting in long queues.","Positive"
"You have to wonder when profit comes before service. We spent two days at the two parks. Yesterday you could barely move in Disneyland. Some queues were 150 min wait and fast passes for most rides were finished by midday. Our family of 5 only went on a few rides and then left in disgust. This morning we got there at opening (8am) in order to make the most of it. Whilst the crowds were a little better, we still didn't get to do all the rides and left at 5pm. Pretty disappointing when you consider our kids are young teenagers so only a few rides appeal to them. Trying to get the ART back to our hotel was a nightmare. This was the worst of the three theme parks we visited this holiday. We will never return here during holiday time (if at all).","Negative"
"Wow! The crowds are just overwhelming. You just have to join a pack going the general direction you want to go, and drift with the flow. We thought Christmas week would be wonderful because of the decorations, and it is if you really don't want to go on any rides and like to sit somewhere and watch all the people. Wait times for most popular rides were two hours and the sea of humanity was difficult to navigate through. Most were happy and polite so just don't be in a hurry to get anywhere. Never again on a major holiday though.","Positive"
"You have to be sadly mistaken to think this place is  just for kids . Don't miss the Parade in the afternoon. It's fun and beautiful. The Light and Fireworks show in the night is worth your day of waiting in lines and walking around for hours. The technology used in the show is nothing like you would have seen before. I don't have enough words to express its awesomeness! Truly magical experience. Be prepared for some goosebumps tears too :P. Indeed it was disappointing to miss out some good rides closed for renovation. Even more disappointing was waiting in a line for about 45 minutes and they announce that the ride (Indiana Jones) is facing technical problems  Please come back later . But if you focus on the good part of your day, its going to be memorable experience altogether.For thrill seekers, must try Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Indiana Jones.I thoroughly enjoyed the Frozen sing along as well as meet and greet Disney Princess Tiana and friends. I am not a kid but still they made me feel so special in that brief interaction that it turned out to be an amazing experience. highly recommended because there is a child inside all of us.Overall, be prepared for a hectic day but a truly magical one.","Positive"
"This Disneyland, while much smaller than other Disneylands, is still quite enjoyable. There are many things to do. One whole day (from 10AM to 9PM) is enough. We went there in the start of summer. It was very hot and humid! We drank litres and litres of fluids. Good part was there weren't a lot of people. We didn't have to line up for the rides. The staff were very friendly. They're building some new attractions, so that's something to look forward to.","Positive"
"Disneyland is a nightmare. It's old, outdated and crowded. We lined up 3 times for splash mountain, totalling 3 hours in total. It broke down as we got to the front of the line every single time. Perhaps it's time to retire the ride if not the theme park???I complained, and had to line up to do that. A JOKE. Hated the place, Will never ever go again.","Negative"
"I thought long and hard on my title, and as have yet, not written poor review for anything, let alone terrible. I just can't believe how little customer service there is, how poor the environment and atmosphere is, and that there appears to be no control over the volume of customers (yes customers Disney!!!) who are allowed into the park. That said, my review is not because today (our second day) a Friday, felt so horrendously claustrophobic and inhibiting for our 4 year old that we left after only 2 hours; 1 hour of which was spent queuing for a ride (auto something) that was an archaic pitiful attempt at entertainment, that goes nowhere, does nothing interesting, and ends with disappointed kids, taunted by the prospect of queuing for 80 minutes to get on the Finding Nemo submarine ride. The crowding is so bad it makes you feel very uncomfortable, unable to move anywhere without being pushed or shoved. If you have children who use a buggy (we have 2 kids one of whom does), then maybe wait until their old enough to not....its just a nightmare...you can't go anywhere with the buggy, even the monorail makes you fold it to use. I was quite surprised by the number of adults in the park without kids, but hey, its for everyone, I get that, but there really is quite a dominating feel to the park by groups of 'big kids' (read grown adults behaving like kids) who can make for an unpleasant environment. Major Point 1: Mickeys Halloween party   Saved by the Light Parade and Fireworks which are spectacular, and the only thing that makes the price of entry worthwhile. Dear Disney, great work on the lights, theme music and all that, but holy crap, the place is full of grown ups dressed up, barging around the place with bags full of candy. It was the least child friendly thing we have ever done of Halloween. Major Point 2: Disney is designed to get the most money out of you in the least amount of time possible. Given that they own everything, and you pay an exorbitant amount of money to get in, get some staff that actually want to work there. I would say 50% of the people we met who worked there couldn't appear more pissed off if they tried. The worst customer service I have seen anywhere in North America. Major Point 3: This is NOT a child  centric   child orientated or friendly place to bring small children. It is certainly more suited to older kids above the age of 8. We have a tall 4 year old, but saw several pre schoolers literally pushed out of the way because they were just too short. At least let them down lightly; maybe a sticker , or badge. There are no chill out areas to go with small one's. Be warned, when its busy it is just hellish. This can't be right in a park with this much real estate? It is so geared to getting money out of your pocket that you have to really work hard to look for highlights. Last Major Point: The Characters....ABSENT ABSENT ABSENT   I used the Disney app to try and track down characters that my 4 year old was dreaming of meeting, and that are littered all over the 'Disney Marketing videos'....we hardly saw any characters in either park. The most characters we saw was in the nighttime parade, other than that they are noticeable only by their absence. It is quite shocking given the price, marketing and anticipation for the kids that you can't find anyone, and the rare few you do you have to que for 30 minutes for the privilege of a photograph.....you HAVE to que because there are so few of them around. Today, Friday 30th in DisneyLand main park, in the space of 3 hours walking pretty much the entire area, we saw Thor and Captain America at the end of a very long que. That was it. After we gave up and decided to leave, we saw a tap dancing chip munk with about 20 people stood around, and a line of 50 people queuing for a picture with a giant pumpkin...that pretty much summed it up for me....Where was Peter Pan, Buzz, Woody, Monsters Inc, The Neverland Pirates, Mickey, Mini, Pluto, and so on. Disney would say, hey they were there, check the app. Well I have nothing to gain by saying otherwise. If they are there you have to search; hard. Which with a 4 year old is not easy in 31 degrees. Shouldn't the theme park be full of these characters enriching the experience? Halloween Party.....shouldn't there be trick or treat everywhere along the stroll, in the shops, on the street, like there is in most places outside on Halloween? Not a few special trick or treat trails with a 40 minute line up of immature dressed up adults? Trick or treat is for the kids, not adults for christ sakes. If they could put the effort and occasion into everything that they put into the the parade and fireworks it might live up to the marketing hype. But they don't The rides are old and tired and appear to be breaking down or in need of repair, the tickets are over sold and over priced, and the food is mostly over priced with poor service and lack of care. All in all I would not recommend anyone visit Disneyland with young kids. Maybe its a different experience with older, more worldly wise kids, but with an almost five year old that things Buzz Lightyear is a real Space Hero, and who truly believes that there is a Neverland with Pirates, its pretty rough constantly explaining that they must have gone to save the day or be having a lunch break....and sorry buddy I know we've been queuing an hour, but we're almost there....oh you need the potty....and yes I know its scary with so many people...save yourself a small fortune an use the money for an actual vacation...their about the same price!!!!!","Negative"

"Went to park for 2 days in early may and booked tickets through UK travel agent who promoted the fast pass as an added extra unfortunately fast pass isn't fast pass at all it is an advanced cueing system available to everyone so doesn't work at all managed to get on 3 rides the first day went back 2nd day and fast pass cues where already past 3pm so we left having spent   200 to go on 3 rides so really not hsppy","Negative"
"This is my forth time at Disneyland   Main Park   and certainly my last one for a loooong time. Price for park entrance continues to increase, however the attractions do not improve, rather they tend to get old. While some time ago it looked as the magic street with Disney characters walking and cheering your kids, Main Street is now only a shopping avenue. Mickey and his Disney friends have disappeared. if you want to meet them, and take pictures of your kids with them, you will have to cue, as they became an attraction like any other: Peter Pan, or Utopia, etc... You need to walk to them for a picture of two, and be prepared to cue. At the time of our visit, 2 November 2015, four mechanical attractions were closed for maintenance or being out of order, so even in that  green  day, we were cuing an average of 30 40 minutes for an attraction of 3 5 minutes at the available attractions. If you decide to go for the experience anyway, roam to all attractions were you can take your free fast pass   and do that early in the morning, because at midday fast pass tickets will be gone.","Negative"
"Too much fun brings out every emotion in kids so there were tears. But the thrill of being at Disneyland was huge, as was the enjoyment of the rides, the atmosphere, the different lands, and the eateries. Nothing like it back home!","Positive"
"Amazing park to go with your family, kids and loved ones, probably a day is not enough to cover the whole thing as so much of things to see experience   Must visit whenever you can","Positive"
"Who decided that paying over 50 pounds to spend 7 hours of the day in queues and 30 minutes on rides. Stopping occasionally to pay huge prices for the worlds most dissapointing coffee and snacks.Staff were nothing special and the cost of everything was so over the top I gave up converting prices to sterling as it was depressing me.This place lacks the majic of watching a disney film. Trying to recreate this and be involved in it failed massivly. It was a massive, expensive waste of time. Saying that, the kids loved it and my wife really enjoyed it too.But one of the worst aspects was how many people were smoking. The smell of Smoke and popcorn will always remind me of this place. I know the rules are different in France, but wow, what a message to send to my kids!","Negative"
"I was looking forward to more. I was looking forward to being the place Walt built and seeing main street and seeing the castle and sadly it had so much construction you couldn't see it. I did enjoy riding rides only at Disneyland that Walt had his hand in. He still made it family friendly, but you could tell how he didnt expect it to grow like it did because the wait lines areas where very short and the rides where on the smaller side but still available for anyone of any size. I expect in summer or fall months it would look better when they were doing major construction. We would see characters but they always said the line was already too long, so I suggest being there before the character is suppose to be around and be the first few in line or you won't get to see them. Restrooms were clean and so was the park. My husband and I still had lots of fun. Make sure you allow time for parking in the garage its $20 and then you go thru a medical dector and then load on to a tram and then you get to the park. So allow enough time in the morning. Lastly have fun and watch where your walking. :)","Neutral"

"This time at Paris Disney, our sons were older and able to walk...and you want to be prepared to walk a lot. We average 14km day just walking around the park, so, make sure you have your hiking shoes   most comfortable shoes available! The food quality inside is pretty average and the coffee is woeful. Best idea is to be prepared to pay for food or bring your own sandwiches! The park was decorated with Halloween theme at this time of year which adds another dimension to the visit. There were Harvest Festival themed parades with catchy songs.Waits for rides...even at this time of year the park was busy. We were staying in a hotel at the park and even still, couldn't jump the line at all with a Fastpass. You had to queue at some rides just to get the Fastpass, so, best to dedicate one person to run to each ride you absolutely want to have a ride on which has a Fastpass, whilst the others queue for another ride. We had waits of between 25   70 minutes for some rides.Overall, still a magical place which the kids loved.","Positive"
"Step back and apply some logical thinking. It's an awful lot of money for not many mediocre rides (and when we went in April, 10% were closed for maintenance). Half of your time will be spent standing around in queues, and you'll be lucky to see any of the characters for a photo opp close up. That said, the parades are good, and the closing show at the end of the day is worth hanging around for. Would we go again? No. but then I'm sure we said that last time    (Europa Park in Germany will get our next visit).","Neutral"
"I guess that the world of Disney was a bit disappointing this time around.Being a Sunday bank holiday in Paris with not much to do, we decided to go to Eurodisney as that was something that I really wanted to do. I had the experience of the Walt Disney World in Orlando but was curious to know how much this one could compare to the one in the States.We were quite unlucky as most attractions where close either due to maintenance or because of technical failures or even because the attractions were  on tour  the Space mountain with Aerosmith, something that I was really looking forward on doing.Being Ratatouille one of the most acclaimed one, we decided that it was worth spending 50 minutes waiting   as per the sign   an hour went by and we barely moved in the que, after a short while they announced technical failure and that were doing their best effort to solve it. After 2 hours, we were almost reaching the entrance, but just most people gave up on waiting as the technical failure announcement could still be heard. We gave up after a short while with one of the hostesses saying that they couldn't solve it and to come back later   we had already spent more than 2 hours queuing.We decided to go back to the park and pop over the Haunted House, got in in about 10 minutes and once in the carriage, after moving a couple of metres, the carriages stopped and the lights were off for about 15, until they turned the lights on while we were locked in our carriages.After what must have been almost half an hour, we were released and evacuated from the attraction as it wasn't running due to... drum roll, technical failure...We decided to head back to Indiana Jones, which we had previously skipped, and we couldn't even get trough, there were 4 ladies, dressed up as Indiana, telling people to turn around as the attraction was closed due to... guess what? Yup, you got it... technical issues!I totally understand that attractions must be kept in their best conditions to assure safety and that people enjoy the most out of it and that sometimes they have to be closed for that but I can't understand how Disney still charges full price with more than 50% of the park available to visit. We couldn't even get on the train to go around the park, after waiting for 40 minutes (when the board stated 20) we were warned that there was an extra 20 minutes waiting...This was a bank holiday weekend in the UK and was clear to see that there were a lot of disappointed people there, maybe most of them had the same idea that we had, having a fun and cheerful day with the Disney family which turned out to be a sort of a flop.","Negative"
"We were excited to make reservations to eat at Blue Bayou Restaurant inside Pirates of the Caribbean, Disneyland Park. We made reservations the day after we reserved our trip. We had eaten in California Adventure a couple times in the past, but we hadn't eaten at Blue Bayou and heard it is a must due in the Disneyland Park. We were so disappointed. First of all, we were given the table closest to the door, and right by where the server station was at. We could hear the servers all talking about their guests and we were as far away from the d  cor in the restaurant as was possible. We were seated and a female server came up and took our beverage order. She said, I'm just filling in for your server who is on his lunch break. He'll be back before long. We saw a man lurking around the tables around us, taking orders bringing them beverages. But he never once came near us. The kitchen brought out our food on a tray covered with food warmers, and sat it near our table. It must have sat there for 5 to 7 minutes before the server came near it to bring to us. The busser had even come over and looked at the food and you could tell, kind of thought about serving the food, but thought better since its the servers job. Food was pretty good over all. We didn't leave hungry. But we didn't leave a big tip either. We won't eat at that restaurant again, next time we go to Disneyland Parks. We'll try another one.","Negative"
"Not really much to say, except if you have spent most of your Disney time in Walt Disney World in Florida this one is Disney Lite. Totally worth a visit, and you can probably see the whole thing in a couple of days.","Positive"
"My husband and I, while visiting Paris, went to Disneyland Paris. We took the RER A to get there. That was definitely hassle free because the train station is right near the entrance to the park. *Oh, save your RER ticket to swipe it to get out of the train station.After going through security (a bag check basically), we arrived at the ticket entrance. The line to purchase tickets was insane, I am so happy that I purchased the tickets online before we left home. I also got a deal for a park hopper ticket since they are celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the parks opening.Now, I am a huge fan of Disney World and I go at least twice a year, so I am a little partial, so I was expecting the same overly friendly cast members I didn't really get that much. It was a little disappointing since that starts off the enthusiasm of being there. Anyway, we entered the park and there it was, Main Street, with a wonderful view of Sleeping Beauty's castle. We started in Discoveryland. I went on the Space Mountain ride the line was so long, but it was a good ride. We went to Adventureland which was a little suprising. It's an Aladdin theme as opposed to a Jungle theme, so I loved that. To summarize, the negative was that the lines were incredibly long, that park was so crowded (this was a Wednesday, so imagine a Saturday), some of the Cast members weren't as friendly as they could have been and the grounds weren't as  spotless  as the park in Orlando (but now I am being a little too picky). The positive was that they had a few different themes that I had never seen before and they had lots of playgrounds for smaller kids. We also did Disney Studios, but it was also just nice to experience. Unfortunately, two of the rides that I would have like to have ridden were closed for refurbishment. They did have an amazing looking new ride, Crush's Coaster, but by the time we got to it, about 3pm, the line was at least a 75min wait and there was no more FastPass available. My advice is, get there in the morning and get the FastPass first thing because they will run out.All in all, I was happy that I got to visit, but it's not a place that I plan on visiting again.","Neutral"
"My favourite place we visited in Paris so much so we came back on our last day for another visit. My son had a fantastic time as did everyone else only thing I could complain about is the crowds but they are inevitable and unavoidable don't let it ruin you visit.","Positive"
"horrible experince with my three year old daughter. It was so crowded there were even lines to get into gift shops. I did not bother trying to make my daughter wait 2 hours in line for the peter pan ride.disney obviously pays the fire department to look the other way in terms of overcrowding. Walt is turning in his grave seeing his guests treated like this: squeezing the life out of them for every penney to maximize profit.they pay their employees so badly that only overweight desperate grandmas in need of income will work there. they dont even look at you and smile. they are too buzy being depressed.","Negative"
"Great for the young and old, seeing the wide eye wonderment is priceless.Visited some years previously and have noted a marked improvement, Disney has certainly spent some coin .The landscaping is intricate, well maintained and a highlight on its own, not to mention the remainder.","Positive"

"My family has been going to Disneyland every four years since I was a kid and there is a standard that is uniquely Disney, until this trip. There is clearly a management issues because if employees are openly rude to guests at both rides and eateries, it means that either management doesn't care or they are modeling the behavior of their managers. Either way, it's inexcusable.The park was dirty, again, not the Disneyland standard.The three star rating is only because of the characters who in the July heat stilll engag and enthralled the children that lined up to meet them. Then there is the parade, the bands and the fireworks; the only saving grace for the price charged for a destination that is no longer worth it.","Neutral"
"As a family that has already been to Disney World Orlando (more than once) perhaps we   ve been spoilt? The level of service from the very start, in the car park, is just no way    Disney    everybody even in the pay cubicles were wearing Hi Viz waistcoats over their uniform. The team in the car park could not have been less interested in where you park leaving many guests parking randomly and leaving spaces empty all over the car park. And the charge of 25 Euros is too high! NO    WELCOME to Disneyland    message heard from a single    cast member    in fact it could have been Alton Towers! No    Welcome to the Park    show of any kind at park opening. The atmosphere seemed so flat by comparison despite us having fabulous weather. Don   t get me wrong the major rides and the Character photo points and the layout and architecture are pure Disney Magic and very young kids will be amazed by it all. It   s just the cast members don   t exhibit the pure enthusiasm and high levels of customer service that you get in FLORIDA.","Neutral"
"The new Cars Land is awesome, but there are people tripping and climbing all over each other. They were filming a commercial to attract more people. Isn't there a fire code limit?The rest of the park was great and the lines were reasonable. Disney has high standards, but I can't understand why the food is so bad. But what can you say? I will be back next year","Neutral"
"We have been to DisneyWorld twice as well as Universal so to be honest Disneyland was a little underwhelming  but with that being said it was great family fun! Tips: if staying at at Disneyland hotel get up early and use the extra magic hour. This worked well for our family (mom, dad, 13 year old boy and 11 year old girl) at California Adventure. Be there at least 15 to 20 minutes before the extra magic hour begins. Go directly to the Radiator Springs ride as this is a new attraction and the lines get extremely long. Although we got there early and the line seemed long it moved fast. We headed directly over to Tower of Terror and literally walked right on, next road Screamn' Roller Coaster twice (no wait) went to Toy Story (this gets long) and then did the farris wheel all before 8:15. Then with the big rides over could relax. Get tickets to the World of Color   now with fast pass (this fast pass is not connected to the other rides with fast passes.) You get a section you will file in and stand or sit until the show  it is a can't miss. With all the big rides done we went back to the hotel after lunch but before we did got our fast pass to Radiator Springs (by now the fast pass return was 8:00! Be aware fast passes for Radiator Springs does not open until 8:00 when the entire park opens.) But this worked out well we came back did the Aladdin show (a can't miss!) the lines for this get long but there really isn't a bad seat in the house so don't sweat it. Rode Radiator Springs and went over to catch the World of Color show. We did California Adventure in one day  seemed adequate and we felt we hit everything we wanted to.Now for Disneyland  we again used our extra magic hour  but this was a bust! We were unaware that the entire park is not open   only Tomorrowland and Fantasyland (if you have a young princess that wants to see the Frozen Queen Elsa and her sister beware the longs are very long! People raced back there and by the time the park opened the line was 2 hours long!) We were frustrated as we wasted a lot of time lining up for the Matterhorn and it was repeatedly broken down, in the end we never did get to ride it :( so then we thought we would head over to Indiana Jones   only to find out that park wasn't open  so by that time we waited in line to get in. Everyone was headed to Indiana Jones! So while everyone lined up to ride we got a fast pass and headed to the Haunted Mansion, Jungle Cruise and Pirates of the Caribbean and pretty much walked on  then headed back to Indiana Jones, which is a must! We took in Fantasmic but unlike Disneyworld you stand  we were over by the Haunted Mansion and although the view isn't awesome you can catch the whole show  you have to get there super early to be front and center and it isn't necessary. No fireworks the night we were there as it was too windy. In spent an afternoon and an entire day at DL to get everything in due to the crowds. The Magic Mickey show is great and I recommend it!Other tips: Be patient, take breaks during the day if possible, please put your kids in tennis shoes there is a lot of walking and anyone gets crabby if their feet hurt, sunscreen, have something to entertain young ones in line, make sure your kids are tall enough to ride before getting all the way up to the ride (witnessed a poor little guy getting turned away at Radiator Springs  he was heartbroken), you can get free water at any place that serves fountain pop, catch the parade it was awesome, try not to bring big bags (have to be checked when going through the gate and someone has to carry it around all day if you don't have a stroller), use the fast passes, I recommend 3 days so you can take your time and enjoy both parks  minimum.","Positive"
"This theme park was over crowded,then you have to wait for a ride like about an hour then they came with the excuse that the ride broke down , and it wasn't only one ride it happens to five rides they came with the same excuse,the food was so expensive all over the area including the harbor street,the T shirts forget it too expensive too,then the FAST PASS they make you wait for about three hours for the next ride and still you have to wait in line.this was my third time and my last I go there.then we went to Universal Studios,and sea world,that was great,no problem waiting too long in line,the ride were working alright.That i love it the BEST AND THE BEST.

"As an Aussie, my fiance and I visited Disneyland in Anahiem for the first time in our 20's and we LOVED it, so much so that we returned another time a year later. Im a big Disney fan girl.However, Hong Kong Disneyland was a huge disappointment. It started off promising, we got there by the MTR and was excited to see it had special Mickey shaped windows on the train and hand rails on the roof. We got there and the station seemed impressive...then it started to rain. Ok, cant help bad weather I guess. It turned torrential so we had to buy ponchos to keep dry, and as the line to buy tickets was LONG we were rained on for about 30 45mins before even getting inside.I was drenched by the time I did get in, and the lines were very long. That wasnt so bad, but people constantly pushing in the line that day was getting more than annoying. At the Anahiem Disneyland, all staff members are refered to as the  crew  as everyone is in character, even the ride attendants and people in the shops, everyone is super happy and friendly. Not in Hong Kong, no one was in character and there was no Disney  vibe  at all. It was very disappointing.Not only that, but I was the only one in our group who had been to a Disneyland before, so I was talking up how great it was going to be, and of course everyone else in my group had been dreaming of going to Disneyland since they were kids. They hated it. I tried to tell them this HK one was just terrible, but the one in Anahiem is amazing but they wont listen, they wont be going to Disneyland again after such a bad day at Hong Kong's Disneyland.Lonely Planet's description is spot on, give it a miss unless you have very small children. Only they will like it. Maybe. Its all just a merchandising opportunity at the Hong Kong Disneyland. Its tiny, doesnt have many rides and only has a few of the great rides such as Space Mountain.I would not rate Hong Kong Disneyland, just give it a miss, and I say this as someone who LOVED my 3 day trip to Anahiem Disneyland in my 20's. HK's version of the  happiest place on earth  was very disappointing and there is no atmosphere or happiness whatsoever.","Negative"
"We were travelling with a child with special needs so we needed to get a special pass for him and his carer when we arrived at the park as this cannot be done online.When we eventually found the area where we get the passes , we had to queue in the freezing cold outdoors for an hour   there were only about 5 people in front of us but each pass took nearly 20 minutes to issue   they should really move this process indoors.Each special pass allows 5 people to basically skip the queues   we were a party of 3 adults and 3 children and at most attractions we didn't have any problem getting on with the extra person but I am sure if the ride was very busy they might enforce the 5 people limit rule.The children all enjoyed the rides.I really loved wandering around at night when all the place was lit up.The staff were all quite friendly and helpful.","Neutral"

"We consider ourselves good Disney clients; we live in Miami and we have been to Disneworld Orlando many many timesWe also had a Disney cruise and, every time, we had a great experienceWe always considered Disney service and, why not, value for money a great plus....you pay more but you get much moreThis, till we visited Disneyland ParisWe spend three nights at the Disneyland hotel, great location but super expensive vs. the service you getI mean....6 euro a bottle of water at the minibar, 52 euro person for an average buffet at night and the list can go on....Rooms were OK with a good service which, I believe, is the minimum when you spend an outrageous amount of money for three nightsBreakfast was average to say the least and, definitely, not for a five star hotelThe parks are just a mere copy of Orlando with lest attractions and more lines....you are standing in line most of the time, we had to wait four times for the attraction to resume work again as they were having technical problems all the time; this is something we never experienced, esp. for two consecutive daysThe care for details, which is a  must have  for Disney, was badly missed in Paris.....a lot of rust in the attractions and common areas which were, also, very dirtyThe prices are simply OUTRAGEOUS....40 Euro for 4 hot dogs and 4 sodas...everything so so expensive for very poor qualityWe spent new year's eve at La Grange : 150 euro each for waiting 40 minutes outside, under the rain, before getting to our table, 20 minutes to get a bottle of water on the table...we had to move our dishes as the waiters were not doing that and the list can go on....And this, for a buffet that was simply average and with long lines to get a small dish fullWhat a waste of money and, by the way, the prices for the other restaurants were even higherWe will NEVER EVER go back againWe spend for three days more than what we spent for a full week cruise with Disney during the same period of the year with an impeccable serviceWith the same amount of money we could have stayed in Orlando for ten days and this is my recommendationSave a bit of money, buy an air ticket and go there if you want to have a real Disney experience at the correct price...I think in Paris they are still living in another planet...I have never felt so  robbed  and disappointed in my life after a vacation....and I have been to more than 130 countries and hundreds of cities or hotels for business or holidays or both","Negative"
"Our family has been to Disneyland California many times and Disney World once... There is no comparison with Disneyland Paris though. Here the cast members are nearly impossible to find and almost always unhelpful. Smokers are everywhere and are a disgusting distraction. And lastly, the attractions were constantly not working. At some times it was a challenge to find a ride that was actually running. Our children enjoyed most of the rides but even they said they would not want to return.","Negative"
"Everyone knows the saying,   the happiest place on earth ! I remember as a kid that I loved going to Disneyland Park every year with my parents and running with my sister to get on all the rides. Now, I get to share this same joy with my son. It is priceless to see how much fun and his wonderful smile when we visited Disneyland last week! This was his 5th time to Disney! There is something about the parade, the rides, and the characters that all ages love this park! We used the Fast Pass efficiently so it all worked out well. We had a wonderful time and memories to last a life time!","Positive"
"We visited the park for the second time recently and they just don't have the care and attention to detail the Disney parks in the states do. Little character interaction, over priced everything (even for Disney), half the rides are closed, everything is just beat up. Best part is the castle and dragon beneath so check that out. The kids loved it though.","Neutral"
"PRICE is way too high. Rides are constantly closed down(Nemo) or closing while in line(Star Wars Hyperspace). If you have to pay over $100 each, children included, give us our $$$$$ worth!!!!!!!!","Neutral"
"This place may be good if you have young children. Granted, we visited on a busy Sunday afternoon and evening, however the park should be built with crowds in mind. We only visited the Disneyland Park, not the adjoining park...thank goodness for that.For adults I think it is a big disappointment if you are trying to follow your childhood dreams.The place looks dated and old. It was surprisingly small in area. The crowds were crammed in. You had to queue for everything, and I mean everything. Food, rides and toilets meant a queue.The fast pass system was great until staff say that they are not issuing fast passes for  whatever  ride anymore.We managed to use two rides or attractions during our 7.5 hour stay. Temple of Doom and Haunted Mansion.The food was terrible, couldn't even find a hotdog in the USA! Again, more and more queuing.I have never seen so many children crying and upset in one place.The best aspects of the park were the character staff. They did an excellent job. Store staff were not as enthusiastic. So many young people in the park were doing a great job. The saving grace of the experience was the day and night parades. They were brilliant and again, character staff saved the day. The fireworks were excellent as well. At times being obviously  watched  by security staff was off putting.I would not recommend this park for adults, go to the other parks in LA.We had an issue with ticketing that was very well handled by staff, can't fault them on that.It may be worth just going for the parades but don't get your hopes up for the other attractions if it is a busy time.","Negative"
"The whole resort is looking it   s age (25years) and needs updating, overhauling and needs to ensure it remains a place to visit. Long queues at peak season are inevitable but two major rides were closed resulting in long queues at every ride and even the ticket office only opened three booths resulting in long lines before you even get in! The restaurants offer the same fare of fast food. Come on Disney wake up! Offer more choice and keep the prices reasonable.    16 for one rib, one sausage and a small piece of chicken with 17 chips adds up for six of us! But the choice is always limited to hotdogs, burgers, wings and fries! Why?? (A sign the management are happy with their avaricious style and not listening to what the other public need and want). A small bottle of water is    3.19. Frankly disgraceful. Overall the rides are past their sell by date with our 8 year old , asking who? What? Never heard of it! Would we go again? No. I suggest saving and going to Florida. It   s worn better. It   s cleaner and you don   t feel that you are getting ripped off. The parade was worth staying for though","Negative"
"We were very excided about visit Disneyland Park this was planned to the highlight of our holiday in US   but it was almost a nightmare...We choosed a weekday, in September   hoped less people because of school day...The end of the line was at Harbor Blvd before 9 o'clock... At security check we had to throw away our selfie stick, I don't know why because later in the park we saw that many people used. Finally we could enter to the park after 1 and half hour waiting (with a 5 years old kid). In the park everywhere had to wait 10 20 30 minutes for a ride   terrible!!! There were lot of people with stroller, finally it was impossible to walk without hit a stroller... And so on and so on. We asked a girl from the staff and she told it was a very strong Monday..Finally I can give only one advise to the management, please limited the number of sold tickets for a day   because it was a very bad experience for us because of the too many visitors.","Negative"
"Park was very busy and the queue times were quite long at times but this is to be expected. DLP was enchanting at Christmas for my 2 girls who loved every single minute of it. If you dont mind the queues, the bitterly cold weather, rude adults that push in front of children to see the shows, then DLP is amazing and awesome.","Positive"
"I was part of a group and we all came to the realization that the expensive pricing, the fact that you are squeezed into the amusement park is not amusing. With so many other tourists constantly milling close around you. Most of us adults got sick and tired of being shoulder to shoulder with thousands of people for up to 10 hours! The food was OK. I also saw a few Disney trucks with the brand name Sodexo on them. Sodexo is a world wide institutional catering services provider company. In other words many of Sodexo's clients are hospitals and universities. I personally have better things to do on my vacation having to spend an hour waiting on a ride if I wanted to take one . . . . especially so after paying a ton of money for the park entrance fee.","Neutral"
"Got our stroller stolen today by Grizzly river run. Headed over to file a report and then with Anaheim PD next. Disneyland security won't do anything about the situation. If you Need you can file a claim online with Anahein PD alsp there are officers just outside downtown Disney by the Starbucks. ","Negative"
"if you are a disneyland veteran you might find it a bit small with some of the traditional rides simply not there. upside is that the lines are manageable alrhough that might not be the case during chinese holidays. not great value for money therefore. ive heard that it has been improved recently so will check it out and comment further","Neutral"
"i hate to compare it with Disneyland in California which I had been to several times because in terms of size, they are so apart! HK disneyland is much smaller, less rides of course. But they also have the traditional parade. Most of the good performers I have noticed are Filipinos. :)","Positive"
"World of Color was great, a must see. Had lunch at the Aeriel's Garden and although it was quite pricy it was well worth it to see the look on my grand children's faces when the princesses came out.","Positive"
"We were in the Park 2 days and we spent most of the time in the queue, despite the fact we had priority tickets! Queue to get in, queue to eat, queue to buy a drink, queue to buy ice cream and priority tickets don't give you an advantage on majority attractions, hence more queues! Priority tickets are advertised as having 'extra magic time', which means you can enter the park earlier in the morning, but I am not sure what is the point as we went straight away to Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, but it was closed until Part opens for everyone else and we could not print the priority tickets before that time either. Also it seems that if you hold one priority ticket for a ride which you can go on in 3h you cannot print another one! Hence I would say the only thing priority pass lets you do is to queue for majority of the time 'outside of the queue'. Not a great value for money. We also found that some attractions were closed and staff standing outside did not provide a reason. We also faced multiple planned renovation closures.I have installed a Disney app to monitor the queues, but when the app said 15min queue it was 45min, we also found that sign outside the 'Meet Mikey Mouse' said 10min queue and it was 45min again.We did like the rides: Pirates of the Caribbean and 'its a small world' the most.","Negative"
"I am a SoCal resident, during my last trip to Disney, I wondered for the first time, if greed is overshadowing the magical kingdom and moreover the vision that Walt Disney had laid forward. With increase in price, you would expect the value to go up in regards to one's experience, but not in Disney. Seems like their objective is to let way too many people in the park that you would be lucky, if you could even experience 4 or 5 rides. Well well no one ever forced me to go there, its just that our POP culture has made this entity so powerful that it can just about get away with too many things. Walt Disney may be shedding tears from his magical kingdom up there.","Negative"
"We had a great time at both the parks! Although it was quite busy; the efficiency at the park ensured we never had to wait in line for longer than 35 minutes.Staff was always friendly and everything was so clean! We enjoyed a full day with rides in rock n roller coaster, hyperspace mountain, crush's coaster and tower of terror.It's a very expensive park, but they are one of the best I've been to in Europe.","Positive"
"We were in Disneyland in the end of August. With 2 kids 1 and 4 years old not an excellent idea, however it was enjoyable for elder one. Overall impression of the Disney  why I spent my money for spent our time in queues which sometimes was more that 1 hour, regarding the  quick pass  its ended right away. It looks like they need to change the policy for the tickets. Some people took places (on the main street for the best view) on the Magic Show which starts at 10 pm from 6 pm and it was so weird. Would not recommend to spend your time here in summer.","Neutral"
"It was nice to see the original Disneyland but to be honest we wish we hadn't bothered.To be fair we went to Disneyland on a Saturday during the summer holidays. Our visit consisted of a walk around the park and waiting for more than 5 hours in queues to get on 3 rides!3 rides: Haunted house (1.5 hour wait), Splash Mountain (2 hour wait) and Thunder Mountain (1.5 hour wait)...after that we just wanted to go home...Wish we'd spent the time on a beach and saved ourselves $400!","Neutral"
"The park was not over crowed   It was the best time ever  Short lines for rides  Food amazing we ate street the Carnation Cafe","Positive"
"This was the third visit with my family but the first since 2002. We have been to Disneyworld in Florida 3 times since our last Paris visit. Unfortunately, there appears to be no limit on how many paying customers are allowed into the park with the most popular rides having 75 90 minute waiting times. What really struck us though was how run down the whole place now looks. In the Village, the shiny Harlequin effect looks like its been in place for about 50 years. The whole place is actually dirty and I find it very hard to believe that the concrete paths are ever pressure washed. For some reason these days there are security check points everywhere which really does take away the pleasure of being there. I have also read other reviews highlighting the smoking in the parks. I agree totally. At one point while waiting for my son and daughter to return from Space Mountain, my eyes began to water because of the number of people smoking. I really do think that Disney need to re invest some of the massive amount of money they must be taking from the excessive number of daily visitors.","Negative"
"Disneyland is AWESOME!! I went as a kid and had fun!! this time I went as a 50 year old adult for a business convention for send out cards and had a BLAST as an OLDIE!! :) ha! the rides were so fun and exciting!! IT REALLY IS THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH!!!!!!! :) ","Positive"
"I've been to all the Disneys bar one (Paris, Tokyo, Florida and this one) and I think this is definitely one of the smaller ones. But it is still great fun and we definitely didn't run out of things to do. Our group was made up of a 16, 17 and 41 year old and we did not get bored at all. We initially weren't going to visit but as we were delayed by the volcanic ash cloud for 6 days we decided to, and weren't disappointed. (Visited April 2010).","Positive"

"I'll start by saying Disney is not my cup of tea at all, but if you have kids, it's a pilgrimage you must make.From first hand experience, Disneyland Paris is no better or worse than the two in the USA. They're all equally plastic, and simultaneously expensive and cheap.Here are my survival tips:1) Bring as much food and drink as you will need for the full day. Everything for sale, everywhere is staggeringly expensive and extremely low quality highly processed junk. This is without exception  I challenge anyone to find anything that is even remotely fresh ad unprocessed.2) In school holidays, be prepared to queue  for everything.In the interests of providing a fair and balanced review, some of the rides were great, and staff members we interacted with were generally very helpful.","Neutral"
"There is not much for adults to enjoy. I was a bit disappointed. I felt Grizzly Glutch is the best part of disney land. Getting vegetarian food could be a challenge. it is a full day activity. Universal Studio, Singapore and Ferari World Abudhai in my view are better. Paint the night parade and fireworks at night is worth a watch.","Neutral"
"We were not going to go as we are in our 50s with no kids with us but friends talked us into it and we are so glad we did   it was a great day and yes some things were closed for maintenance but with the wear and tear they would get that is to be expected. Food compared to Australia in a theme park was plentiful and reasonable. Worst ride   the submarine not enough happening   got soaked on log ride   loved the river cruise In adventure land ","Positive"
"This was our third visit, with teen kids and it was a very bad experience. August is the worst time to go, waaaaay too crowded!! Some rides had up to 120min wait time, which puts you off big time.Apparently, if you want to enjoy what's left of the park, you should avoid 15th of May to 15th of October, but then it's probably colder.All the prices went up A LOT in the last 3 years since our last visit, like an average T shirt from 9 10 Euros to 25 30 Euros.","Negative"
"if you dont like crowds and queing then its not for you. we had great weather which helped but with so many people it became overwhelming. the queues for some rides went past the hour even fast pass made you come back a few hours later and then there was a 30 minuite wait on them. the drinks and food is pricey so take bottles of water or juice from the restaurant in the morning and make up ham rolls from the breakfast to keep costs down. if was going again i would go out of season.","Positive"
"Disney afficiadios   worse Disney in the world by far. Shabby and grotty. Most Staff indifferent and poorly kitted out, some tried to bring the Disney Magic but they were fighting a battle. Food choice poor. Disney 'stuff' choice poor. I was prepared to spend serious cash but they didn't seem to want my money. Lots of rides and attractions closed. Most other rides (even cinderellas castle) were shut while we were in line due to 'technical difficulties)   my son was quite happy on buzz because we were stopped for so long he maxed out. Another ride had us waiting for over a hour before the line was dispersed with fast passes. It has been our mission for the past 10 years to visit ever Disney and I am so glad this was the last one because I would never have gone to another. Disney needs to throw some serious cash at his place. Spruce it up. And Disney really need to spend considerable effort in staff training. Truly un magical experience","Negative"
"I went to Disneyland Paris this week with some friends from Uni.The park itself is very beautiful, everything it'd hoped. Sleeping beauty's palace was a fluffy pink concoction surrounded by trees cut into square shapes, adventureland would convince anyone that they were in the middle of a desert. The attention to detail in the design of the park was incredible.I very much enjoyed seeing a parade, waving to Minnie Mouse and blowing kisses to Buloo from the Jungle Book! The park is lovely and really reawakened the child in me.However, as an adrenaline junkie, I found Disneyland to be dissapointing as a theme park. The roller coasters were all in the dark, (which I find takes away any excitement) and, while all visually stunning, were pretty tame. The best ride is definitely The Twilight Zone   Hollywood Tower, in the Disney Studios. The ride is very well executed, set in a desterted, haunted hotel. The staff are all dressed up as 1920s bellboys and seem to really enjoy working on this attraction. When we got into the ride, we were sent into the  Library  to watch an introductory video. A member of staff was hiding behind the door, jumping out and scaring us with a loud  Bonjour!  When the lights went out to watch the film, he walked around the edge of the crowd, tapping people's shoulders. This really got everyone into a spooky mood and put the audience into the right frame of mind to enjoy the ride, a  sudden drop  in a pretend service lift.I read a lot of bad reviews about Disneyland before I left. I have to say, the staff were lovely, (if you approached them with a  Bonjour, pardon, I don't speak French    it's rude to launch into a sentence in English and that's why they can get snappy), and seemed very keen to help us. A useful phrase for me was  Cest mon anniversere!     It's my birthday!  which helped me to use an expired fast pass!I would say that if anyone was contemplating a trip to Disneyland, please bear in mind that it is for CHILDREN. The theme park rides are aimed at them and there aren't really any screamers. If you go to the park, enjoy the Disney aspects of it, the parades, Space Mountain, Alice's Maze etc. After all, this is what Disney does best, not roller coasters!","Positive"
"I went to Hong Kong Disneyland on Saturday, 28 July 2007, as part of a 9 day holiday in Hong Kong. Having never been to any other Disneyland, I can't compare it to the original in Anaheim or the Paris Disneyland. All I can say is that I had a truly fun, memorable day and would love to return again in the future.To get there, I caught the MTR from Tsim Sha Tsui and the Disney Resort Train, which was fun, fast and cost a minimal amount (just use your Octopus Card!).The park is immaculate, colourful, well designed and easy to walk around.As other reviewers here have said, souvenirs are excellent quality and reasonably priced; as are eateries in the park.The only drawback was the weather   it was 36 degrees Celsius (around 102 degrees Fahrenheit!) and the humidity was high. But there are plenty of airconditioned shops, restaurants, etc, which provide a welcome relief from the heat, and are also interesting and fun to explore.Don't miss the 'Golden Mickey's Show'   it's very entertaining and well worth lining up for.Overall, I had a wonderful day and enjoyed my Hong Kong Disneyland experience immensely.God bless!","Positive"
"We took 3 under fives to Disneyland Paris and had a wonderful time. I would definitely recommend hiring a stroller as little ones will moan about the walking. We were lucky enough to get VIP fast passes which were a must although many rides were not fast pass. The only real queue was for the 'meet a princess' which involved a 2 hour wait. You will queue for other rides but this is part of the experience. I've been to Florida park and believe that Paris is better for smaller ones. The end of day show was fantastic but many people tried to push in after you had been waiting for an hour! The restaurants were standard but expensive. Overall, we had a great time and just seeing the look on my little ones faces when meeting Cinderella and Mickey Mouse was simply priceless.","Positive"
"We surprised my great grandson for his 7th birthday and took him to Disneyland. We had a great time and he loved meeting the characters, getting autographs and photos with them. It was a magical trip for all of us. I totally enjoyed the 3 days we were in the Magic Kingdom. I will be 68 this month and I felt like a kid myself!","Positive"
"The park was too over crowded. We couldnt get on rides or see anything even with a fast pass. We paid $20 for a photopass and was told we could get online when we returned to Australia to download the photo. The photo is not there, we have made a complaint and no one has had the decency to get back to us. I am seeking a refund of the $20 we paid. This is a rip off so be careful. It would be decent of your staff to reply to my complaint!!!!","Neutral"
"This was our 15th trip to Disneyland and we are avid Disney fans, but this trip left us very very disappointed. We queued 75 minutes to ride Indiana Jones and we sat in the seat and it broke down, we queued the next day for 65 minutes and it broke down again. Space mountain and Big Thunder Mountain were also broken down. Queues were ridiculous with hardly any staff around to give information or to 'police' what was happening. The quick service restaurants were anything but quick service! This trip was a very very expensive disappointment..","Negative"
"I have had a good read of the reviews before placing my own and I can only conclude that some of these people are staff of the Park or have been on a staff training day or when the MD has been visiting.The park is dirty. Take a ride on the steam boat and see the litter floating on the edge of the  river  at least two feet deep and I challenge anyone to say it is clean and sparkling. The concrete on the way in is all cracked with huge chunks missing and every few minutes one of us would trip on the uneven levels.On Thursday 19th (our last day) the following rides were broken: Armaggedon, Crush, RockN Roll Coaster and Indiana Jones. These are the majority of the larger rides and most were not available for an extended period. My children had queued on Indiana Jones for over an hour when it broke down   the staff advised me that everyone had been removed from the rides but after returning from a frantic 20 minute search I found them being led out   really frightening as a parent!As we were on a short break we ate at Disney or in Disney Village every evening. We were prepared for expensive but the reality was worse than that. As we had three children 12 14 they were eating adult portions but we stuck to one course and one drink to limit expense. No meal cost under 120 euros and the most expensive was 180 euros.Even lunch was bad. 50 euros for 5 hotdogs and bottles of water!Having been when Disneyland Paris had first opened I was looking forward to seeing the changes. It is like a tired old lady needing a major operation. More needs to be spent on the upkeep and maintenance of the place and with most queues being over two hours on a chilly February day, they need to look at speeding this up.With the current exchange rate I would recommend that people think carefully about going, or be prepared to spend a lot   whatever you consider expensive   at least double it!","Negative"
"40 70 minutes of queues for 5 10 mins of fun or lunch. Oh wow 60 mins to queue up for a picture with Mickie too.  Don   t come during school holidays. It   s a big waste of money and time.","Negative"
"OK let's start with the positives. The booking process through Disney, to include hotel, travel, meal plans an other add ons was very good. However, from there, things not so positive.We live in the digital age. Well we might, but Disneyland Paris clearly don't. We were bombarded by emails helpfully telling us our booking was confirmed, then periodically as our trip drew nearer, reminding us how close it was, and what we should book (restaurants particularly, I'll come back to that).In every email there was a reminder that we must PRINT   our confirmation letter to present at the hotel, and other Disney check in. Incredible   we me must print it, despite having the confirmation on at least 3 different devices. For what it's worth, the 'confirmation letter' seemed to contain a reference but then only tell us how to book restaurants   by telephone. But now we've been I can see why the need to book restaurants in advance was so frequently highlighted.In the confirmation emails it also mentioned the App to download. My instant reaction was 'great   I will surely be able to sign in by entering my booking reference and be able to download my entire itinerary including all tickets'. Alas no, this App just tells helps you navigate around the park and give you real time information on ride queue times. Nothing personalised whatsoever. So away we go, armed with plastic wallets containing travel booking confirmations whilst at least utilising the Eurostar App which does cater for digital tickets. The Eurostar Disney Express experience was a good one, checking in our luggage at the Disney counter in Ashford, receiving all our menu plan vouchers and park tickets, and handing over at the other side, before heading straight into the park which was the big benefit of that service. Of course at the park, we're using small paper tickets which we have to keep safe for 3 days as well as carrying a wallet full of menu plan paper vouchers.After first afternoon at the park we returned to the Hotel (Disney New York Hotel   I'll review that separately). It was 5pm and we spoke with Concierge to book a restaurant for that evening. We were informed that nothing at hotel possible before 9.30pm and earliest we could get elsewhere in our meal plan was 9pm, which is late for our 5 year old   especially after a long day. We learnt very quickly and booked all our meals for the remainder of our stay at that time.Now....anticipating the answer being along the lines of we were warned to book restaurants in advance (by phone), my wife is a vegetarian with a mushroom allergy. But of course the menu's for the restaurants aren't even available on the really helpful App, so it's actually quite difficult to book in advance   and especially when you don't know what menu you can pick from at each restaurant with your meal plan. Really the information you get is quite appalling.To the parks themselves. Maybe I didn't read the small print properly, but we understood that as Disney Hotel guests we got access to the parks between 8am and 10am before the general public arrived. The reality is that only one park is open for that, and of that park, only half of that is open, and of that half, only half of the rides were open. The queuing was long as expected with it being half term in UK and France, but the queue for some of the Fast Pass tickets was also unnecessarily long at times and again leaves you wondering why those sort of functions can't be managed digitally. Certainly I don't think we made the most of our trip to Disney because of the lack of ease in doing most things.Overall I'm glad we went and had the experience, but there is no way we would go again while the park continues to live in the dark ages.","Negative"
"Had a good time, but I will not recommend it for adults unless you are a Disney fan. Most attractions are outdated, even with the  remodeling . I guess they put a fresh coat of paint and change from technicolor to HD, because most stuff looks old. There are a few good things, but not worth paying a hole day for 2 3 attractions.","Neutral"
"This park has none of the Disney magic     grumpy employees, untended flower beds, and the piece de resistance, a damp, musty bathroom in the Newport Bay Club hotel that went unaddressed despite a request to hotel management to clean it.","Negative"
"You should only visit Disneyland Hong Kong of you are accompanying children. Nothing major for adults to explore at the park and as far as the rides are concerned, each and every ride at ocean park is much better than Disneyland. Food options at the park are rather overpriced and so are the souvenir shops. So in a nutshell only worth it for kids and Disney aficionados.","Neutral"

Ryanair never return our money(the worst airline company in services).BUT DISNEY CALLED US AND RETURNED ALL OUR MONEY: 484 EUROS!!WE WILL LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THEIR UNDERSTANDING . they knew that we cannot trabel with 4 children in Paris that time. They called us 3 times and after 2 weeks they returned all our money. This are serious companies and we appreciate their great service. We hope that in the next future to be able to go to Paris , to have peace and visit the parks of Disney.","Positive"
"We had a four day pass and I was basically done after the second day. The place was crawling with people. I had a scooter to share with my husband and people just kept cutting us off.

"Went to Disneyland on Monday, Nov 20 with my husband. We decided to purchase the    MaxPass    to get the most out of our visit. You   re supposed to be able to book fast pass lines in advance on your phone, however you can only book one ride at a time.So we arrived at Disneyland at 8:30 AM, our first fast pass ride wasn   t available until 11:20 (splash mountain). Did this, then booked the next available fast pass at 12:50. The park became so packed and busy with people, we could barely walk anywhere! We tried going for lunch but all restaurants kept telling visitors that it was    reservation only    and we would be turned away. We stood in line for 45 minutes for a hot dog, then barely made it to Indiana Jones where we stood in the    fast line    for 30 minutes. After this ride, we tried to book another but the next available ride wasn   t until 2:50 pm. There was a parade going on and we couldn   t get across the park to space mountain, etc (all other ride wait times were 75 minutes   as per the park!!)We just decided to leave, not worth the money or wait, and the park was way too packed with people.Such a waste of money.","Negative"
"Was busy during Thanksgiving. Weather was nice. California Adventure was really crowded! Make sure you use the Fast Pass system to get tickets!!!","Positive"
"WHAT. A. RIP. OFF.My family (two adults, three children) had all been looking forward to visiting Eurodisney and had accepted the 60 euro cost of return travel from the centre of Paris where we had been staying.On arrival, we willingly accepted the 341 euro cost of entry (one park one day) (2 x 73 euros plus 3 x 65 euros).Considering we arrived at 10.30am, and left at 6.30pm, can you guess how many individual rides we managed to accumulate between us? (By 'ride', if all five of us went on Space Mountain, that amounts to 5 rides, however if all five of us walked around the less than thrilling 'Swiss Family Robinson' tree house, that also amounts to 5 rides)Well, in total, over 8 hours, we managed just 33 rides between us i.e. average cost of each ride worked out at more than 10 euros and to be honest, some of those 'rides' should not be considered as such. OK, I grant you that Space Mountain and the Indiana Jones ride (50 minute queue which my daughter (and consequently her mother) could not go on as she was too short by a few cm) were both very good, the ghostly mansion was OK (60 minute queue) and Pirates of the Caribbean (40 minute queue).I accept that there is a 'Fast Pass' option which got us onto Space Mountain in just 8 minutes, however as there are understandably only a limited number of Fast Pass tickets each day, there are only six rides in the whole park where the Fast Pass tickets apply, and as you are only allowed to be in possession of one Fast Pass ticket at any time, this does mean that the majority of your day is still going to be spent in heinously long queues. In fact, by 3pm, the advertised times that you can use any new Fast Pass tickets are too late for the average family that intended to be on their way home by 6.30pm.I accept also that the school holiday is obviously going to be busier, but for Disney to not lower prices to take account of the heinous queues is SCANDALOUS PROFITEERING. In fact, there were FAR more people wandering around than were actually queueing up for rides. And where do they wander to? To the inordinate number of overpriced restaurants, cafes and refreshment stops hosted by bored looking and impolite staff   that's where.I appreciate also that we could have come along in the evening or stayed longer, when there would have been fewer people around, however with youngish children, this isn't really an option.NOTE   we did not see one single picnic area in the whole park   they clearly want you to buy expensive food and drink from their outlets   but some of us (particularly as one of my children is allergic to several foodstuffs) would prefer to bring our own sustenance.Indeed, rather than knocking down some of these outlets and building more rides from the massive profits that they are clearly making, Disney seem to have a lacklustre approach to their hardworking and far less rich customers. Many of the 'attractions' at Eurodisney are tired reproductions of the attractions in the Florida park and should be updated modernised replaced.All in all, I feel like I have been totally ripped off by the whole experience   we spent more than half of our 8 hours there in queues and went on 7 different attractions in total, the only one of which that truly brought smiles all round being Space Mountain.So, Disney, please stop being so bloomin' lazy reaping huge profits and ripping off your customers, and make your 'attractions' attractive again.","Negative"
"Everything was broken down or closed. What rides were open we had to wait 45 min or more in line for rides that are a minute or 2 minutes long if we were lucky. Peter Pan ride is what we really wanted to ride because it's new and on my map it showed the ride to be open until park closing time. (10pm) we went at 8:45 and they were already shutting it down. We paid a LOT of money just to fight crowds and to find out nothing worked or was closed. You could not pay me to go back.","Negative"
"Huge mistake! I thought the crowds during the summer were bad. They make the park seem empty compared to going during spring break. A 3 hour wait for the new Cars ride and fastpasses were all out by 10:15? No thanks. 2 hour wait for Space Mountain? Just trying to walk around was diffiult. Next time, we are going to take our kids out of school. At least the kids had fun.","Negative"
"Disneyland and Park are still living in the 1980s  pre internet, pre overall technology when it comes to their offerings of rides that have been there since I was a kid, however. The tickets prices have been on a VERY STEEP RISE. The value is just not there, especially when you find the management doesn't care about the LONG LINES and the countless hours people wasted for a 90 sec. to 5 minutes rides. Theme parks in Dubai and other countries are light years ahead in terms of innovations and technology usage. Disneyland is a legacy, and it's milking that legacy to the last drop. Fantasmic show is the same since the early 1990s! Soaring over CA is the same too. How hard is it to update the two shows and offer different versions? I had to go for some family reasons, but if it wasn't for that, I DEFINATELY won't go.","Negative"
"This was our 3rd trip to Disneyland. We had a 4 day pass. They really make sure you don't sit down. Very few places to rest. Disneyland staff is very RUDE. If you cannot be nice and professional to tens of thousands of people everyday, DON'T WORK HERE! Ride operators were rude. Employees are ESPECIALLY RUDE BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE PARADES. Food and drinks are Super expensive So bring your backpacks and fill them up with water and food. That's how we survived.Go in the BEGINNING of the morning to meet all the characters some of the princesses are out in the afternoon too. We were able to meet Marry poppins near Main street, and Tianna on the Tom Sawyer boat museum. Beauty Belle, and beast were running around in fantasy land, but never met anyone or took pictures. Made a lot of people mad. Splash mountain is a lot of fun. Space mountain is fun BUT JERKS HARD AND FAST! If you have health problems, I would not ride it. The Finding Nemo ride is opened again. The Disneyland railroad is closed. Indiana jones is always fun. The jungle cruise is always fun with your small children and infants. You can buy a big turkey leg for $10 on main street, good for several people. BRING YOUR OWN Water. Buy a Camel back (Backpack with a water bag for drinking in it) from coleman or amazon and take that. There are a lot benches to sit on in Cal Adventure. Elena of Avalor is by the garden restaurant in Paradise pier California adventure. The Frozen princesses are at the froze theater next to the New Gaurdians of the galaxy ride. Black widow and groot are there also. Never got to see Spider Man or Capt. America in our 2 days there. California screamin' is lots of fun. The toy story under the roller coaster is fun, but the long is LONG. They also have goofy's sky school and the the little mermaid. The World of color light show is very worth staying for, then the park closes, uunless you the California adventure grand night pass. Which I don't know what is.","Neutral"
"We have just returned from a family trip to Disneyland Paris. My two sisters and I decided to take our daughters aged 4 6 and 7 for a day and night. Well firstly can I say that this trip is costly. Everything about Disneyland is expensive. It cost us over   50 per ticket for entrance into the park and what do you get for this??? It seemed like we were walking around a park with hardly any good rides. My first impressions was that it was dated. Have they not updated this park since it first opened 20 plus years ago. Disney you really need to move with the times. The castle is plastic looking and not real like. Where is the Disney characters waving from the balcony? The rides are out dated. We queued for some ride called Le Pays Des Contes De Fee, according to their leaflet it's not to be missed. Well it a small boat ride around some lame small wooden scenes from Disney movies. My daughter could have made in nursery. Where is the animations. Where is the 3D cinematic rides that take you through a journey of Disney film adventures. Where is the holographic Minnie and Mikey waving at you as enter the park? Where is the Elsa and Anna Characters? Your most successful Disney film to date and you haven't decided to make a frozen castle? Where is the magic? All I saw was a couple of unpopular Disney characters in the park where you have to que hours to have a pic with. Mickey and Minnie well expect over a 2 hour queue to meet them. You should have a proper theatre auditorium where visitors can sit properly to see a property show. It seems Disney you have lost your magic, This park is not about the children this is a money spinner. Everything is about making money. We booked to have lunch with the Disney princesses 70 EUROS PER PERSON! The kids menu was Cinderella bites to start and pasta for main. Well what came out for our young kids to eat was laughable. Quails eggs and a load of salad leaves in a bowl. You call that Cinderella bites. Kids don't eat food like this. The pasta a tiny bowl of plain pasta with a small portion of tomato sauce on the side. What a disgrace. The manager said but you pay for the princess experience. Oh what Cinderella Ariel and sleeping beauty walking around the restaurant for half an hour. WHERE IS ELSA AND ANNA or your up to date characters. They should all be in the park every single day. This is a Sham! Sorry but I truly think Walt Disney would be turning in his grave. Bring back the real magic of Disney where kids truly experience good food and great quality attractions and entertainment. Why don't you bring in a macdonalds into the park and a pizza express? Decent food chains. Your greed means you are so lacking in quality. Very very dissappointed. I would say to a family saving all their hard earned cash to go. DONT BOTHER..","Negative"
"Recently went on a trip to Disneyland in Anaheim with the family.Considering how much we spent on 3 park hopper tickets, you would think the  magical experience they sell everyone would be magical.It was by far not very magical at all.They do charge for parking if you drive. We were there with a 3 day park hopper.We went what we thought was slow period after Easter break. That was not the case. First day we were there, the park was very crowded and filled with locals. The park opened at 8 :00 am. We arrived at 7:15 am. Good thing we did. The crowds and lines of people at the gate were horrible.Secondly, the rat race to get to the rides at park opening was absolutely horrible. People were literally running with their children so they could go to the ride of their choice so they wouldn't have to wait in line    and they also ran to the fast pass machines as well. If i had known this was a marathon I would have packed my running clothes. Fast pass machines ran out of tickets in 20 minutes. THe wait times for standby were absolutely terrible later in the afternoon.The sheer amount of strollers and parents who bring their infants    is just overwhelming. They are parked all over   . very hard to squeeze through strollers with screaming children and crowds.Wait times for the Frozen princesses   if you are looking to do that    have daily wait times of 3 4 hours. In turn you see hundreds of tired, crabby, children waiting for hours. Very poorly run. You would think Disney would plan it out better.We experienced much of the same on the other side at California Adventure    their most popular ride is Radiator Springs Cars ride. We had to run to that ride   .because the daily wait times vary from 1.5  3 hrs. While standing in line the ride did stop    it broke down, they got it up and running, however that pushed the morning wait time to over an hour first thing.Unfortunately if you want a low wait time for this ride, your only choice is stay at a resort property and have a magic morning at California Adventure. Otherwise   . the fast pass for the regular patrons is gone very quickly and standby times are very long. If you are a single ride    waits can be from 45 60 min.On our last day at Disneyland we had a magic morning. It was probably the worst of the 3 days. The crowds were huge, the rat race started all over again. People running etc. Only half the park was opening for magic morning. Adventureland and Frontierland was closed. You pay all money for tickets and you have a magic morning   . how about opening the whole park!!! By closing off the 2 areas   . it got even more crowded    and there were more races. Adventureland had most of their rides close for refurbishment   . and the main attraction splash mountain was closed indefinitely due to the weather. The Big thunder railroad was also closed in Frontierland because of mechanical issues.My children left disappointed that some of their favorite rides were closed.THe park food was not healthy, standard amusement park food. Overpriced.Overall our Disney experience was a overpriced, rat race mess. To charge that much money for tickets and to have to run to rides    was not my cup of tea.Needless to say kids got to see Disney and they have no desire to go back .Disappointing experience   . I will spend my vacation money elsewhere    and have a nicer vacation somewhere else.","Negative"
"We have been to Disneyworld many times. Disneyland is much smaller tighter. It was crowded during our stay. We elected not to purchase Maxpass or Park Hopper, and the consequence was waiting in long lines and only riding a half dozen rides. The kids got restless, we tired of waiting in line, and we left to go get dinner. Still, we checked the box and have now been to Mickey   s parks on both coasts. If you had to choose   go to Disneyland first, before Disney World.","Neutral"
"Disneyland is always a fun place, There were some rides closed for upgrades. It was also the time Disneyland was getting ready for their 60th anniversary, and they were tapping TV shows, so some of Main street were not available.","Positive"
"I have been here to many times to count and I still enjoy it. What I don't enjoy are all the closed rides, at the time of our visit, and they need to work on traffic flow around Tomorrowland. It seems every time we go down there you can't get around all the strollers under the monorail track, its a bit petty I know.","Neutral"
"Disneyland Paris   the train station at the entrance stinks of raw sewerage, the car park behind it has a stench of urine where people probably urinate. You are approached by Gypsies and beggars on the train to disney and all you see is graffiti. The staff there are very rude and impatient and unless you can have a car or afford the extortionate prices of their hotels don't even think about booking a hotel near by as there is no transport to them after 8.35pm. There is little night life which consists of a western bar of a few amateur line dancers and a night club of cheesy 80's music in which you cannot breathe because of the smoke (especially cigars) plus your clothes stink the next day.","Negative"
"Loads of rides closed in the run up to their celebrations next year. Peter Pan, Star Wars, thunder mountain. Queues were outrageous. Why are there not more characters going about? Why are there no TVs to warmth while queuing? Why do Europeans fail to understand how to queue? Not a fun experience for adults it kids. I've been twice and I'll never go back. Way too busy and badly organised. Overpriced and not in any way a magical experience.","Negative"
"Really disappointed to have to give such a low rating, but the severe overcrowding that takes place completly spoils the visit. Everybody expects long queues at Disney, but the huge crowds even make it difficult to walk around the park and it felt unsafe at times. Have waited for this trip for so long, but left feeling very deflated.","Negative"
"Visit Disneyland, Anaheim CA twice within the past 2 years from Hawaii. Just a great place to be, especially if this is your first visit. Took me 58 years to get here but it was an amazing experience of a lifetime. 17 of my family had a 3 day hopper pass to Disneyland Park and California Adventure and really made use of it. On my first visit, I didn't know what to expect and told the others no, I won't ride any rides i'll just take pictures of my family and grandchildren. But once you're there an awesome feeling takes place within you, next thing you know I was riding rides I didn't think I was capable of enjoying. Of course the lines for rides were pretty long at some but to be expected. The staff there were great and helpful. No words to describe being there, visiting there in February and October for the Halloween theme. Stayed at the Desert Inn right across the street from the entrance, so convenient. Being there I wish I had visited Disneyland 40 years ago, but it made me feel like a child all over again!What a Magical Experience!!! Please visit if all possible. Aloha...","Positive"
"My family and I were at Paris Disneyland on 1 Jan 2012. This is our first trip to Disneyland. My kids were very excited but we only managed to try one ride at the Park. It's way too crowded here. I would suggest Disneyland to apply designated date tickets. By doing this everybody will have the chance to play at least half of what Disneyland has to offer. It took us 14 hours by plane to reach there and we ended up trying only few rides. its very disappointed.","Neutral"
"This is amazing, wonderful experience that one should have at least once either with your friends or family members and or kids as kids really love this place as one can see all Disney characters in live when there is big rally then there are many fun and thrill filled rides and games. It requires 1 2 complete days to see whole of Disneyland. It's the only one theme park which is in Hong Kong and one of the biggest theme park, accommodating millions of visitors annually. So I really recommend that it's a must go and must watch place.","Positive"
"I was in Paris with my husband and 3 sons just over a few days ago. It's our 3rd time at Paris Disneyland in about 8 years. Everytime one walks through the entrance gate, there is always still excitement and anticipation that he or she is going to have a magical time there. Sad to say, this time round, this didnt quite happen to me: (! While queueing up to enter, we were already confronted with several families with young children. The parents were all puffing away on their cigarettes and blowing smoke into their kids' faces. Needless to say, we were not spared from all that secondary ciggie smoke.Unfortunately for us, the day turned out to be quite a cold one with rain the the forecast. Hence, many families sought shelter in covered areas close to the eating areas as well as near the toilets. When they started smoking there as well, those supposed rest areas became filled with cigarette smoke which meant that we could hardly a respite from the rain nor cigarette smoke! Hence, for non smoker parents who are keen to bring their young children to Paris Disneyland, they really do need to prepare themselves for the shocking amount of smoking and smokers there.","Negative"
"We love Disneyland!   Clean, Fun, Exciting, Memorable...","Positive"
"3rd visit to the park, first visit stayed in Sequoia Lodge, second Newport Bay, this time New York. If there was to be a fourth time, and there won't then it would be back to Newport Bay. I'll cover the hotel issues in another post.The park! Well it's Disney so the usual impressive Disney infrastructure always in evidence. We had a really heavy rainstorm on one morning and within minutes of the rain ending and the sun coming out there were people out sweeping the puddles away. The attention to detail always impresses, as does the general cleanliness of the place.However my main complaint is down to the number of attractions which were either closed, some for refurbishment others just closed, and others which just kept breaking down so you'd be turfed out after having queued. Too many to mention frankly.Now couple this with the balance seeming to have shifted unfavourably between the entertainment side and the retail  try and extract every last euro out of the visitor side  and then add in a healthy, or maybe should that be unhealthy dose of exchange rate misery, and it starts to leave a bit of a bad taste.Which nicely turns us to the food. Now Disney has never been particularly noted for fine dining, though Walt's always was, and indeed still is, the exception here. We had a first rate Sunday lunch on the half board plus menu and even the picky eaters in the family tried and supremely enjoyed everything, even things they thought they might not like. However away from Walt's, oh dear oh dear. You expect junk food, Casey's Corner is hot dogs for heaven's sake so nothing fancy. But soggy wet buns wrapped round ultra cheap dogs? Come on for that price I'd expect fine dogs not the rubbish that was served up on our visit, and way below what was served on previous stays.And so it went on, some places on the HB  list trying to be too fancy and just failing way way short. Others who have no pretensions to be fancy just being grim, eg Punta del Oro Tex Mex, found ouselves sticking to the floors and to the tables. YUK!Beaver Creek Tavern, fatty lamb, cold vegetables, dry and cold swordfish steak, desserts were good though.Parkside Diner, inedible main courses on the buffet, many adults were resorting to the childrens menu.Annettes Diner, another bright star and all three of us fully enjoyed our meal, they have been alongside Walt's as one of the more reliable places over the years.And then you try to go to places that you've visited before, eg Cowboy Cook out barbecue... closed, La Grange at Billy Bob's.... closed and so it went on. Les Cascadeurs... closed.Having paid for Half Board plus we were struggling to find suitable places to eat. We've found on previous visits that the best way to approach the parks is to take a sit down table service lunch early afternoon, that gives you a rest, and sets you up for the rest of the day. With what was on offer, assuming they were actually open, then this strategy was, for us a non starter.Of course it's not all a negative review, and some of the cast really do work hard to make people's visit enjoyable, but it seemed that they were struggling against a huge penny pinching strategy. For example first time ever with a long wait for It's a Small World. Why? Because only reduced number of staff on, and so those who were working refused to load every boat and were only loading alternate boats. I can however understand the logic why they were doing this, but it probably needed just one more cast member on duty. Yet the shops were packed with staff, extracting your money you see?So I'm sorry Disney Corporation, you charge a not inconsiderable sum for a visit, you've tipped over the edge from providing an attraction and turned it into a huge cash extraction process. Truth be known it was always that, but it is now just so blatant.I cannot recommend this venue until things change.I post very few reviews on here mainly due to time and only if I feel I have something to say, very often what I would say has already been said by others, so why take yp TS bandwidth.But DP needs a stinker of a review to get the act together.","Negative"
"Went to Disneyland with my wife and 2 teenage daughters and what a let down. Crowds everywhere. Rude people everywhere. Worst place on earth. We were shocked coz we came to Disneyland right after Six Flags Magic Mountain which was a whole lot more fun and the whole atmosphere there was a whole lot more pleasant and happier.","Negative"
"I was so looking forward to visiting Disneyland whilst I was in the US. I have been to the Disneyland in Paris, and absolutely loved it, so couldn't wait to go to the original in Anaheim.Unfortunately, the crowds ruined the experience for me. Way, way too crowded and we went on a normal not holiday weekday! The line ups started before we even got through the main entrance. We arrived at 8.30am. First was the line up for the bag check (15 mins). Then a 25 minute line up for tickets (this could of course be avoided by purchasing tickets online). Then the line up to get in the front gates took 50 minutes!!!It just got worse from there. The lines for ALL rides were horrendously long and got longer as the day progressed. You could not comfortably walk through most of the park because of the amount of people there.Fast pass only allows you to get on a ride about every two hours or so. At best you get 4 rides in 8 hours. Although, if you lined up for the rides you'd go on even less as the lines are so long! All this for $99 per person! Seriously, never again!!!!","Negative"
"It's not the most extensive Disneyland you'll ever go to but it's ok. If you're into thrilling rides, go to Ocean Park. But it's still good for younger kids of course.","Negative"
"The Indiana Jones ride broke down, right as we were going down a fast, incline. As the car jerked to a stop, my lap restraint tightened up and left no slack on my lower abdomen. It was extremely tight and cutting into me. We waved at the cameras for help and even yelled for help. No one came. We were stopped for about 10 minutes and no one came. When the car finally started, I had to ride the ride out in absolute pain. When we finally got close to the exit and in sight of the ride operator, Tara, we yelled for help. She rudely told me that I would have to wait, turned around, and walked away. When I started to yell for help even louder she looked at me laughing. I was crying at this point and traumatized. She never asked me if I was OK. She never said sorry. I was upset and a supervisor Kevin came. He was not very sympathetic, nor did he ever ask if I was OK. He said that this experience would  make for a good talking point at their next meeting.  I was so angry I walked all the way to City Hall guest relations to file a formal complaint. Grace did her job by offering me tissue, water, and a FastPass good for any ride, anytime for our party. Not sure what is going to happen to Tara or the person who was supposed to be responsible for watching the cameras, but I would like to know that the consequence was going to be more than a  good talking point  at their next meeting. What a disgrace to the Disney name!","Negative"
"We have been to Disneyland Paris three times. The first time in 2009 and then again in 2010 for 4 days and more recently in 2014 for 5 days. The first two visits were magical and we really looked forward to returning this third time. Our third and what will be our final visit was extremely disappointing. Disneyland Paris has changed, standards have dropped and the magic and sparkle have gone. The place is run down, dated and not well kept or clean. The toilets were attrocious and filthy! The staff in the restaurants are mostly unhelpful and miserable, not what you would expect from Disney. No longer are there any seating areas for the parades, it is all kerbside, with crowds of pushing people, and the regular parades that used to occcur every hour or so have been taken out. There is now just one parade a day. The crowds are a nightmare, they just keep letting more and more people in, park, packing people in like sardines and what seems to be beyond actual capacity, therefore, those of us who pay thousands of pounds to stay there have to battle to get onto the rides with locals who pay a fraction of the price. The newest and one of the best rides Ratatouille had ridiculous queues (about 1 hr 30 mins) and broke down on the first day we tried to get on it. On one ocassion about three rides we tried to go on had broken down and overall I felt for what we were getting Disneyland Paris is overpriced and in desperate need of an overhaul. They also have this new voucher system where one meal a day and afternoon tea are included in the price of your stay. This results in everyone eating in the restaurants causing again, long queues and difficulty getting tables, e.g previously you could book Mickey's Cafe on the same day, now you have to book about 2 days ahead and have to accept a late booking. Auberg de Cendrillon, although expensive, was at least a treat in the past, now due to the voucher system, it is practically impossible to book. Again we had to accept the last lunch booking, which was very late. The characters were aloof and one character just walked off and wouldn't come over to sign my little girl's autograph book! At almost Eur 160 for lunch for three people, I would have expected a little more of a welcome, friendlier characters and better food. The atmosphere there this time around was flat and quite frankly I just wanted to pay the bill and leave. I didn't enjoy anything about this trip to Disneyland Paris and wish I had kept the memories of my last two trips and not gone this last time. I have never been to the US parks, however, I wouldn't recommend the Paris one anymore it is hugely expensive but not better than any other good theme park that you would get anywhere else in Europe, which would probably cost less, have better rides, friendlier and more helpful staff and cleaner parks!","Negative"
"I love Disney Parks! We have been to Disney World, Disneyland Anaheim three times and Hong Kong Disney twice so we were all fired up to visit Disneyland Paris.Pre booked our tickets and shuttle pass (which was a super easy way to get there) from Australia.Once we passed the groups of heavily armed soldiers patrolling the outside of the park we came to the main entrance to the park which is beautiful and quite spectacular with fountains and gardens etc.Main Street was much like other Disney Parks but we did find the food options very limited and what venues there were had few food options.Overall it felt like that Disneyland Paris was a cut down version of Anaheim with bits and pieces from the other parks . It had little atmosphere and once the rain started we left after only staying a couple of hours.A lot of cost and travel involved for what we felt was very little return. If you have been to Anaheim or Orlando I definitely would pass on Paris!","Neutral"
"My husband and I love Disney. Every 5 years, we go to Orlando's Disney World for our Anniversary. We knew HK Disneyland couldn't hold a candle to Orlando's but we wanted to go for a cultural comparison. While this park has my favorite ride (Mystic Manor) and favorite roller coaster (Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars) out of all of the Disney rides I   ve been on, the rest of the park was lack luster. In the defense of the park, it was raining pretty much all day. (Rain has the potential to put a damper on just about anything.) The parade was understandably cancelled due to the weather. They did end up having the fireworks show at closing. The fireworks dwarfed the castle and it was a little humorous to me that the smoke from the fireworks completely hid the castle by the end. If you are in HK and you love Disney, definitely go for the Disney cultural experience. If you are not a Disney fan, this park will not make you become one.","Neutral"
"We bought a 2 day pass for all members through klook. Getting in was slow due to the crowds but park personnel did their best to expedite matters. For me and my wife, this was our second trip here, the first before we got married. Noticed a few changes; Disney characters are now mainly located along main St USA while the characters in fantasyland are getting lesser (the booths that use to house mickey, Minnie, donald, daisy, Pluto, goofy, pooh). The park has expanded to include toy story land which is welcomed. But now, covering the park in 1 day is no longer enjoyable. Thankfully we got 2 days pass. Lol.","Positive"
"Still as magical at the age of 28 as it was as a young child. The park is immaculate and everyone is very helpful.The fastrack service is useful for popular rides. We weren't sure if we could take drinks or food into the park, but you can and I would recommend doing this to prevent you from queuing for food drinks.The Disney Illuminations at closing time was definitely our favourite moment and worth waiting for.","Positive"
"I was so looking forward to our Disney vacation but I have to say that it was a disappointment!! This was my first time to the park and my last!! The 3 (2 on California and 1 on Disneyland side) rides that we wanted to go on were CLOSED!! Plus there were major issues with other rides. Why would they close the Ferris Wheel and the roller coaster at the same time?? We spent good money to travel there feeling like we wanted more out of our experience than we had. I truly did not get the magical feeling that they portray in their advertisements. I wish I went to MEXICO instead :(","Neutral"
"Fabulous once in a life time trip!!! My 2 girls , their husbands, and my 3 grandchildren. Bought maxpasses for each of us as I wanted memorable photos. We were told that there were photographers throughout the park. We could not find one! So disappointed! Sent an email questioning why and was told to call Disney for a refund. Supervisor told us no.... not refundable. Heartbroken. Please think twice before buying!!!!","Negative"
"Yes it is the original park, I was excited to see that piece of history. Of course it is amazing to view all these iconic pieces from the 50s. But here is the major issue, the  cast members  were very unpleasant.  Maybe I'm bias because I am an annual passholder at WDW and so was my friend who I went with. Both of us were so surprised by how many unhappy people worked there.  We met 3 cast members who were amazing but as the day progressed the level of disgruntled employee progressed as well. They were unknowlegable or just dismissive. They didn't want to pin trade and made it seem as we were annoying them when we asked.  I get that it was a hot summer day but these are paid employees of the Disney brand, they need to step up their attentiveness and be more likable. Walt Disney World cast members really have a massive leg up on their West Cost parent.  It's great to go to this place once. But I don't see any reason to go back except for the holiday celebrations and decorations.","Neutral"
"A lifelong dream to visit Disneyland did not disappoint. It was magic for the moment we entered the car park. We came with our children aged 18 and 13 and what a family experience. Memories were made.","Positive"
"My friends and I (nine of us in total) decided to visit Disneyland during our Easter break. We booked tickets beforehand, from a website that sold it cheaper, plus the meal voucher that included one meal from any restaurant in the theme park. Originally, we had been informed by a misleading website that the $100 meal voucher included both lunch and dinner, plus a snack from the vending carts (which was an extremely good deal, which was why we got the voucher in the first place). But when we got there, we were told that the $100 voucher only included one meal of your choice which was very disappointing and overly priced. I ate a bowl of Japanese styled noodles and had a drink, which were both fortunately quite delicious.As teens, we did not spend time taking photos with Mickey or any of the Disney characters. Instead, we immediately jumped into playing some of the games, including Space Mountain (my personal favorite, although it made me a little dizzy); a game called Grizzly something, I forgot (it was a very creative roller coaster, it even went backwards!); a target hitting game (we sat in moving carts and aimed at targets with a plastic gun); and a ghost house (we sat in moving carts and was guided through a haunted house with scary objects popping out at us). We loved Space Mountain and the Grizzly game, which we played more than five times each. There were many many other games that are more suitable for younger children, but since we only enjoyed more exciting   stimulating games, we didnt bother with the other games that were intended for younger children.As we had got to Disneyland quite early (right after it opened), there wasn't that much people at first and we were able to get to most of the games we wanted to play without having to line up. However, after lunch time, the lines grew increasingly longer and we started having to wait more than half a hour for each game. We left after one last ride of Space Mountain, at around 7 or 8. We had heard that the fireworks were worth watching, but since one of my friends was expected to return home at a certain time, we didnt stay to watch the fireworks.Luckily the weather was quite nice the entire day and we enjoyed all of the games we played. If you enjoy more exciting rides (roller coasters etc.), I would suggest you go to Ocean Park instead of Disneyland. Ocean park has much more rides that are more fun to go on (if you're older than 12 and not afraid of heights). From what I experienced, I would say that Disneyland is intended for younger children. anyone from under 11 years old would experience the most fun here.Have fun :)","Neutral"
"Lots of fun for two older adults reliving their childhood adventures in Disneyland. Although two rides were inoperative, we were able to catch them during our stay without any difficulty.  Enjoyed the changes that have been recently added.","Positive"
"My family love Disneyland Paris, we have been visiting it for the last ten years and have always had a blast. This time however, our expectations were not met. The Disneyland Hotel was as enjoyable as ever, but we had several issues in the park and in Disney Village. On booking, we were warned that Thunder Mountain was closed, so we expected that and although disappointed still went ahead with our booking. However, we would not have gone at this time if we had been warned about the rest of the closures of restaurants lack of parades and shows in comparison to other times and restricted openings of several other attractions. All of this combined to ensure much longer queue times for rides and restaurants at a time of the year when you do not expect to have to wait so long. We had spent so much money getting there, we made sure we made the best of it and still enjoyed ourselves to a point, but it is the first time we have gone when we have seriously doubted if we will ever be back. It costs so much that Disney really need to ensure that everyone goes away satisfied. It is clear that money has been invested in Walt Disney Studios, the main park now needs to have some serious investment in new rides and attractions   some are starting to look very dated.Do not bother to eat at Planet Holywood or Billy Bob's Buffet in Disney Village   service and food both disgusting. Cafe Mickey is definitely the way to go!","Neutral"
"In two days, FOUR rides we were in queues for broke down. The staff gave no information, but only shrugged that  these things happen . No, they don't. Only at EuroDisney. It's never happened at the other Disney parks. FOUR times (that we know of) is a real record.There were long queues for everything, including getting Easy Pass tickets, and Easy Pass entry! Most of the rides had a minimum of a 60 minute wait, even the really short rides for young children, like Peter Pan's Flight and Les Voyages de Pinocchio, which last about 2 minutes. My kids always take part in the Pin Trading program. That has always alleviated the tedium of walking and waiting all day long. But at EuroDisney, you were hard pressed to find anyone wearing their pins on a lanyard. The couple of people we found who were wearing them looked really put off about having to trade! I'm talking about Disney cast members!!! One of them said she would only trade if the pin was part of the same series in her collection! They have completely missed the idea of the Pin Trading program!!! (The idea is that cast members have to trade. Note: if you work at Disney simply don't wear your favourite pins!)It was my daughter's birthday, and I cannot imagine a better way to feel anonymous and un special. We paid for the Mickey Caf   character breakfast and when we sat down, Mickey and all the main characters left!!! The second tier characters came out: Eeyore, Chip and Dale, Pluto...And it took them ages to get to us. We had finished eating and were just waiting to at least meet a couple of them for our trouble! What a rip off!! Is it really so hard, Disney, to make sure that someone in a Mickey costume is present at all times at the Mickey Caf  ??? Something else you don't get at other Disney Parks   millions of chain smoking customers. The dangers of second hand smoke have not reached these people, who do not hesitate to puff smoke on their OWN babies, and certainly on your children. Of course, there isn't much Disney can do about that.We had a buffet dinner at the Plaza Gardens, where I was able to order a cake, and they did a beautiful job there. It was a very nice cake and the waiters sang Joyeuse Anniversaire. It wasn't a total loss. We also had very nice weather. But if I have to go to a Disney Park again, it won't be this one. Walt is rolling in his grave.","Negative"
"We visited on the 29th of April for a hen party visit. Very disappointed that nearly all the major rides were not operating. Big thunder mountain, Space mountain, Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean ( which we did know about) were not working and all the other rides had very long queues due to the closures. The Disney studio was slightly better but some waits were very long. This would not happen in America!","Negative"
"I have been most years since the park opened. It is not just for kids! Much smaller than its American cousins but you can easily fill in a couple of days taking in the attractions. The revamped New Star tours was excellent.","Positive"
"Unorganised. Chaotic when it was raining. It was raining heavily when we reached. We had purchased the tickets online beforehand. The E Tickets machines malfunction and we had to queue with those tourists that purchased the tickets manually. It defeat the purpose of purchasing the tickets online. Moreover, it was raining cats and dogs. My children were all drenched. Was been informed that no selfie stick are allow. Ridiculous ! 9 out of 10 tourists are using. There are ppl out there who don't understand the word 'queue' or are we the only stupid ones that queue. I do not want to name the country as it will be a disgrace to our own race. I would like to suggest Disneyland to give out q number to be fair to those who queue foolishly (like us). Food options are limited. Toilets are clean.","Positive"
"This place is magical, enjoyed the food, entertainment the shops rides. I would suggest the app was extremely disappointing for rides. The park can definitely afford more signs.","Positive"
"I just visited Disneyland and was quite disappointed with the number of ride closures! We were aware that Space Mountain was closed for the year, but many other rides attractions were closed frequently for problems. To list a few:  Indiana Jones   we obtained a fastpass and when we returned the ride was closed. The next day, once again the ride was closed and finally on our third try we managed to get on. (It was a good ride, for your information and worth the wait).  Matterhorn   we were told by other people that they spent 75 minutes in the lineup only to be turned away when they got to the entrance as the ride was shutdown for maintenance after problems. People were led off the ride. This occured on at least 2 3 occasions. We gave up and didn't bother going on it. Pirates of the Caribbean   We went on this ride after about a 30 minute wait and got stuck on it at the part where the town is all singing  Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me!  for at least 30 minutes. This is not a pleasant experience and actually people were getting kind of panicky.  Haunted Mansion   We had a temporary stall when we were on this ride, but only for about 5 minutes. Still, this added to the list of malfunctions in the park.We were not pleased to find we had arrived during the California Spring Easter Break and lineups and crowds were overwhelming.Unlike most reviews, however, we really enjoyed California Adventure. If you are going, check out the restaurant by Soaring over California   the  all dressed fries  (not sure of the name, but they have fries, chili, sour cream, cheese, onions, etc and are fabulous and a good bargain!) The rides are more exciting for older children teenagers and the Aladdin show is awesome. Also, Who Wants to be a Millionaire, a Bug's life, and many others. Very worthwhile.","Negative"
"It's nothing like what they advertise. I was really looking forward to this trip. We'd planned for months by using the forums and advice out there. I was aware that some of the rides would be closed. i knew it was expensive, I was even prepared for the queues. Extra Magic Hours translated into only two areas being accessible. We'd planned for the weather to be cold, but there is misery only a child can experience in waiting 40 minutes to see a princess in the snow and ice. A princess which might or might not be there when it's your turn. The kids got bored of waiting in the cold very quickly. Sure you can ensure your child meets the character of their dreams, by paying extra for a meal with them, but the food on offer isn't suitable for the young, picky eaters. We reserved tables at Cafe Mickey only to discover so had a lot of other people, the kitchen and the poor staff couldn't cope at all they kept everyone shivering outside, yes more queues. We'd planned to make use of the Ranch pool, but we were turned away (along with others) as there was a fault with the pool, and offered a swim at another hotel. This after just driving back from the Parks to swim! As a result the to ing and fro ing cost us a complete afternoon and missing the evening show. If this is Disney off peak, I'd hate to visit in summer, with the crowds making the experience so much worse.","Negative"
"My daughter was turning one and my husband and I decided to take her to Disneyland and I am glad we did! She loved! And so did we! We literally spent the whole day at Disney and we waited to see the Paint the night parade which was amazing! It was a rainy and cloudy day but even that didn't stop us from enjoying Disneyland! We felt like little kids again! I love Disneyland and I will definitely return soon! ","Positive"
"This park is relative new, opened in 2005 i think. 20 minutes taxi ride from Kowloon, cost around HKD 200 for the ride.Disney is Disney, you get what you want. Very nice and clean park with lots of toilettes and places to eat drink. Keep in mind that this park is best for the smaller kids, but there are 3 5 rides also for the bigger ones. Not the bigges of parks, so it is no problem to  do  the park in one day.","Positive"
"The whole place was mesmerizing to say the least. Be sure to queue up early as otherwise you will lose time while entering. It took us close to an hour to get in even though we had queued at the gates early. Before going make a plan as to which rides you want to take else you will keep waiting in the long queues. There are a few rides which are on everyone's list and no matter how much you plan you will have to wait in line. But for other rides you may have to wait only a few minutes. Whatever the wait is, it is worth every minute of your time.","Positive"
"We were very disappointed. The website offers discounted tickets available only for the day afer the tickets are purchased. We were in Paris for a short stay and when we saw that tickets could be bought for 57    for the two parks instead of 89   , we thought it was worth it. Turned out it was impossible to make the booking. We spent 2hours trying but an error message that didn't explain the failure kept appearing. We tried with various of our credit cards with no better success. When we tried to call Disneyland they were closed and when they reopened the next day they refused to offer us the discounted price. We left Paris the day after without having had the chance to visit the park.","Negative"
"It was Disney but I knew I was in the Anaheim area. This was my first time in Disneyland after visiting WDW, 3 times early in the 90's. The 'Land' is right in the middle of a city and it shows. The 'World' is located miles away from the city and off the freeway in Florida and there is nothing to indicate that there is anything else around you. (From the Califonia Adventure theme park I could see the Coast hotel.) The 'World' immerses you into the Disney experience whereas the 'Land' gives you a taste of it. It even has its own transportation system. At the time I went, WDW did not advertise itself on billboards just the directional signs off the freeway. Our Disneyland package had the 5 day hopper and it took that long to get acquainted with the  feeling.  For our first anniversary, my wife and I had a good time but I had an overwhelming need to show her the 'World.' Other notable things 3 rides broke down while I was there   the young staff did not really know how to manage the crowds; they were energetic but inexperienced at crowd control   finally the people seemed to push and shove as if they were at any amusement park (which it is) but they lacked a restfulness felt at a RESORT which puts you into another 'WORLD.' There is a difference and it depends on what you want to experience.","Neutral"
"Loved the rides, hated the lines this time of year...pricing seems to be going up every year...very clean and well kept up","Positive"
"Hong Kong Disney is the best amongst the world as it is very complex and packed within walking distance. It got a the amusement games attract children. No more no less just enough for a one day trip. The parade is the best and the firework also the best. It is recommended to stay in the Disney hotel for one or two night then you can enjoy all the games but no need to rush home. The facility inside the hotel also six stars   ","Positive"
"I've been in Parc Disneyland on June 30th, with my family and a family of a friend of mine (4 adults   3 children).We are talking about one of the most beautiful parc in Europe, in terms of organisation, attractions, etc, but I think Disney Co needs to review seriously the way of managing the queues! The Parc is a long and endless queue: as it can happen children could be tired after one hour of queue (for 5 minutes of funny at the end), I wonder why is not possible to change the experience of waiting with the introduction of some screens showing Disney films. Perhaps the same film of the attraction you are waiting for: it is difficult to do so?Again: while waiting for Peter Pan, after 45 minutes of queue, the access was stopped for a technical problem. We were informed about this issue but decided to stay in the queue: after 50 minutes more (with no further info about the expected time for the technical solution) we enjoyed the experience. The question is: it is not possible in this cases to provide people in the queue with a special ticket to skip the queue for the same or other attractions? It would be a kind of compensation for the wasted time! After Peter Pan we did the queue for Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain but the attraction was broken while we were close to jump in the train (after 40 minutes): ok, we were not lucky that day, but a compensation like a special pass for other attractions would be very appreciated.Another remark: the expected time for jumping in the Disneyland Railroad is not true. In fact the train could arrive full in every station and the people in the train could stay on. So it is true that on average the train is in each station every 30 minutes: but you could wait for the next passage (or more) to hop on it.That's it: please do something for the queues or technical failures or the experience in the Parc won't be different from a normal day of traffic in a big city!","Negative"
"it was excellent except for the accomodations.Disneyland wasn't terribly busy as my family got on over 35 rides,some multiple times without much of a wait.The roads were not overly busy,so we did not encounter large traffic jams that potentially could eat up time which we had very little of as our trip was just a 2 day turn around.","Positive"
"I had such a fun day walking around Disneyland, taking in all the sights and sounds. The only downside is the lines for the rides can get quite long. So be prepared for a wait. There are plenty of souvenir shops scattered throughout the park, so make sure you take plenty of money.","Positive"
"Sad to say, this is the last time I   ll ever visit Disney. It   s an over crowded, worn out park that has nothing to offer than 2.5 hour wait times with smelly Americans who fart because of the amount of junk food they consume. Nothing worked as it should, and all our photos from the small amount of rides we actually got to go on we   re in accessible due to the payment system failing. Don   t waste your time and money to line up.","Negative"
"I honestly don   t know what Disneyland is. It   s not really a theme park since there are hardly any rides. The rides are equivalent to a county fair. It   s just one big souvenir shop with a few county fair rides thrown in. No one is happy here. Kids don   t like it. Adults don   t like it. There is nothing to do but buy souvenirs. Seriously. Six Flags had more exciting things to. Standing in traffic is more exciting than Disneyland. Don   t fall into the trap like us. Disney is not fun. It   s old fashioned. It   s crowded. You wait in line for over an hour even with max pass for a boring 2 min ride. Then you walk another 10 miles to wait another 45 mins to ride another lame ride. The only people who say this place is fun are the type of people who enjoy paying hundreds of dollars for admission to buy coffee mugs and t shirts that have Mickey Mouse or other Disney characters on them. Also i didn   t even see Mickey mouse or any popular. characters. And if you happen to see a character they only stay by the idiots Disney hires to take pictures to sell back to you. Such a scam.","Negative"

"This was our second visit and we were not disappointed.We had the bonus of sunshine the whole time.The park is so clean and tidy which is a credit to the staff.The rides parades were amazing even my teenager loved every minute of it.My only complaint is the toiliets are not sign posted well enough but as we had been before this was not a problem","Positive"
"No one does it like Disney! My teenagers loved this Park, especially the new Space Mountain and the Bobsleds. Queues moved quickly, single rider was available and even when rides broke down they were back in action in no time. I was a bit worried about the new Pirates ride as I was very fond of the old one, but I had no worries. The ride is great and just wait till you see Jack Sparrow. The firework show was the best I have ever seen and is worth the admission price on its own! Everything is spotless and the staff were efficient and well trained. Defintely go, no matter what your age.","Positive"
"Although we frequently travel to Disney World Orlando from the UK we thought to pop across the channel to Disneyland Paris for a long weekend. Disney World it's not   but it is brilliant. We stayed at the Sequoia Lodge which was clean and comfortable with a good selection at the buffet breakfast (toast, pastry, fruit salad, yogurt and a variety of cheeses and meats   this can be quite busy earlier in the day so try and choose a slot for after 10am) as well as free kettles available from the Conserige. Both of the Parks as well as the train station and Disney Village are all within a 10 minute walk from the hotel which is a very nice feature. The Disney Park itself is fantastic   Space Mountain 2 is a more grown up version of the original with loops and corkscrews, Pirates of the Carribean is more atmospheric and the Haunted Mansion is set in a 'wild western' theme. Disney Studios is a smaller version of its American counterpart but the improved Tower of Terror and exclusive Crushes Coaster make up for its smaller size. The food in Disney Village is expensive and almost exclusively American with few vegetarian options so you may want to spend an evening or two in Paris (approximately 40 minutes on the Metro from Disney).","Positive"
"Entrance fee was a bit steep for a one time entry.  More like a small theme park rather than THE Disneyland.  Expected more, actually.","Neutral"
"I   m a massive Disney fan and with Paris being our closest Disneyland I try to go as often as possible. It Never disappoints, this was my second visit this year and the Disney Dreams show is out of this world, one of the best things I have ever seen. The Tarzan show is not to be missed; it is a typical Disney show with a Cirque du Solei element to it. On this visit I decided to give the guided park tour a go, Brilliant, although I will add it   s not for everyone. Its a two hour walking tour of the park(available in all languages) and talks through hidden secrets of the park, many tips to be had and details on the many genuine antiques present in the park. Also many facts on the buildings and history of the park. For me Disney never fails to bring magic to my holiday. I really recommend a character dining experience as they are not much more expensive than the other table service restaurants and are a lovely way to guarantee meeting the characters. Also dont rush off after disneydreams, if you hang around in the park you will get to spend an hour in a desserted lit up main street and miss the crowds at the car parks and bus station","Positive"
"My daughter wanted to celebrate her 10th birthday at Disneyland after hearing all of her friends rave about it. I only relented after finding a sweet package deal with SW airlines AND because it was during the winter months. There was no way I would go during the summer with the sweltering heat and long lines. My kids (ages 10 and and 5) were unimpressed except with Star Tours (make sure to get the free fast pass otherwise you will wait in line forever). Speaking of the Star Tours ride, may the force (and patience) be with you if your child wants to build his her own lightsaber. After the ride as with many of the main attractions, you will end up in one of the theme stores. There is lightsaber building section which can be maddening as the instructions aren't very clear on how to build the darn thing and you have a bunch of kids pushing and shoving to get their parts. I was hoping it would be like Build a Bear where you get all the parts and they assemble it for you. Felt as if most of the rides at Disneyland was a bit outdated and stale. That being say one of the rides I did enjoy was the  It's a small world  as it was so outdated it was almost quaint. Overall impression is that the park can be a bit crowded even when we went during the non peak times. Lots of little kids and babies especially for those slower rides. We had more fun at Disneyland California Adventures. Pretty good military discount (up to six tickets) which you can purchase at any of the the ticket windows.","Neutral"
"Our trip to Disneyland was like a dream. We met princesses and other Disney characters everywhere we went. We loved the Fairy garden and the Matterhorn Bobsled so much. We loved Adventureland, and the adults especially loved the Indianna jones ride....the kids were scared (6 and 10 year olds). We also loved the Star Wars ride and the Jedi show was excellent. The line ups for characters weren't too long, I think the most we waited was 30 minutes. Fast passes were helpful and we planned our day around them. My only regret was not buying more souvenirs from Disney because we started our vacation at Disney and the souvenirs we found after (e.g., Sea World and Universal) were not as good as the Disney merchandise. My daughter wished that we stayed longer at Disney   we only had a 3 day pass. We didn't make it to Downtown Disney, the Aladdin show or World of Color. We had no time! Next time we'll stay longer at Disney. It was truly amazing.","Positive"

Some rides were closed and there are over an hr or two wait for each ride   a ride that lasts only a few minutes! My 8 yr old was totally disappointed. There are better theme parks in Gold Coast, Australia   go there People! Food was ridiculously over priced as they 'package' their offer. Take your own food if you can (if allowed not sure).","Negative"

"I dream of coming to Disneyland since I was little. I never had a chance until now and it was way too pricey and way too crowded. I even got the fast past but it's still at least 1 hour wait for certain attractions. I think my dream died a little because it's not as magical for adults!! LOL ","Negative"
"What a magical place!! I would go back any minutes! All so clean and very well organised. Everybody seems so happy, children and adults. During the week there weren't long queues and we managed to do lots of rides, at the weekend it is just chaos!! Wouldn't go back for a weekend!! Only weekdays...We stayed in the resort at the Newport Bay hotel, clean and characteristic ...a bit noisy at night, some people do not have any respect for others, but what can we do! Highly recommend.....nearer than the USA one...","Positive"
"Absolutely magical. All the people complaining about the queues, what do you expect? It's a very popular theme park, did you expect them to roll out the red carpet for you? Yes the queues can be bad but all you have to do is plan ahead with fast pass tickets etc. Food isn't great but you don't go there for the food.... I have multiple allergies and was fine, again, just plan ahead by looking online what is available before you go. Huge amount of toilets (with no queues!) which is something you don't often get in theme parks. Honestly some of the people on here complain about some very trivial things, you can't please everyone. For an extremely busy theme park which is open almost every day of the year the staff do their absolute best. Can't wait to return next year!!","Positive"
"We went as a Family of four with two teenagers 15 18, over from New Zealand and thought the park was highly overrated, expensive, crowded, and you get no advantage with a fast pass. If you are coming from New Zealand or Australia don   t waste your time and money, just go to movie world on the Gold Coast as we found that a lot better than either Disney park. Too much hype on the Disney name.","Negative"
"Although it is smaller than Disneyland Universal, It is rather suitable with your children at weekends. They can see all characters of Disney in the park, play many games and take photos with Donal, Mickey,....  My children were really happy when we took them to...More","Positive"
"Not sure if it was because we went on a Friday, but the park was so busy it was difficult to walk through some parts. All of the rides had ridiculous queues, and even with the fast passes needed to come back 3 4 hours later. We queued up twice for the Indiana jones ride, and both times got to the front and the ride broke down. Wasted 3.5 hours of our day for nothing. No sympathy or reimbursement from the staff either. Rides were all quite average, would highly recommend next door (California adventure park) for much faster, more efficient queues and more modern rides!","Negative"
"Visited Disney 2 days 2 parks and very disappointed with Disney experience. I had read up before hand that some attractions were closed for refurbishment but to be there and find things that were supposed to be open cancelled and temporarily closed was unacceptable. Staff were extremely rude and not feeling the Disney magic at all, in fact they all looked miserable. All in all it was a very unforgettable trip (but in a bad way) and a very expensive one at that too! I have emailed Disney itself with no reply it   s very unprofessional. Disneyland Paris does not live up to the Disney trademark it sells.","Negative"
"Having been to Disneyworld in Orlando, I found this park to be pretty average. I know it's unfair to compare but even the cast were very rude. I went with my husband, daughter and a friend. There was a long queue for the ratatouille ride so we decided to ride it as single riders. They wouldn't let us stand in the single rider queue because my daughter can't ride (she's too young). When we explained that we're going to be switching and won't be riding together, they refused and told us someone has to wait outside with my girl which meant that someone has to start the queue all over again after 2 of us were done with the ride. They were extremely rude about it, unlike Disneyworld, and they have no understanding at all of baby switch (which we did all the time even in single rider queues).","Neutral"
"Amazing rides, great food and professional cast, but way too many people. Many rides had 70 minute long lines with little shelter from the heat. Fastpasses could be used every couple of hours in the morning but were hard to get by late afternoon. The fireworks laser pyrotechnic show in the evening is truly magical, but I won't go again in the summer heat.","Positive"
"Disneyland really is the happiest place on earth!! Every time I go it gets better and better. When ever I want to go on a vacation I think Disneyland. And every time I go I discover new things that I love about the park. Last time I went I found the Disney Gallery. To get there take a left right when you go into the park it is next to Great Moments with Abraham Lincoln. If you want to find out about the history of Disneyland and collect Disneyland memorabilia you have to stop here. There are original concepts of Disneyland, a video that go's through the history of Disneyland, old park tickets, trains from Walt, paintings and posters of Disneyland, miniature figurines of Disney park old and new, and much much more. In my opinion that is a must see especially if you like the history of Disneyland like me!","Positive"
"We didn't like this very much. We were so excited to be going to Disneyland and had prebooked a 2 day pass and didn't even stay for one full day. If you want to buy select Disney products   it is good (not all though). Every  shop front  was another gift shop. ","Negative"
"Okay, so we made the mistake of going at a peak time, over the Toussaint school holiday break, and that is on us. But I really don   t think our experience would be all that different with smaller crowds at an off peak time. The place is just poorly thought out, under staffed, and not well managed. In face of the disappointments of the day that just kept coming, my husband and I remained upbeat, trying to make the best of it especially for my son   s sake. He is only seven years old and this was his first time to a Disneyland. But it was a hot mess. After ten hours and 230 euros, we got ride two rides and found it nearly impossible to find any food to buy while we were there.Luckily, we are living in Paris right now so we didn   t waste a precious day of some shorter vacation in France on this. But there are so many better options for spending a day with your kids in the Paris region. Please heed my advice and that of others here and don   t waste a day of your life, a wad of money, and your time on this depressing place. After we arrived, it took at least twenty minutes to clear security.We pre purchased and printed our tickets (230 euro for two adults, one kid). Like at security, the park entrance wasn   t so much comprised of    lines    as much as five or so sites of chaotic masses of densely packed people. With no other info, we finally joined a very, very long line, that seemed more orderly that the crush of humanity elsewhere. We were unsure we were in the correct line with the kind of tickets we had. Everyone around us was equally confused. It was chaos. There was ONE poor flustered employee, working this entrance doing the best he could...trying to process the endless line through the high gate and turnstiles, while also having to try to answer people coming up and shouting questions at him over these barriers trying to find out if they were in the right line. If that wasn   t enough, this guy also had to leave his post frequently to let disabled park goers in through another gate some distance away. While we were waiting to enter the park numerous disputes broke out over people line jumping, which was rampant. Some of these interfaces verged on out and out brawls. It took over 40 minutes to get into the park via that line. Once inside, we saw another massive line at the    City Hall    the    customer service    spot which is also the site where disabled visitors get the passes allowing them special access they need to the rides. It is really sad to see disabled adults and children, many of them in wheelchairs, waiting outside in the cold, no doubt for over an hour or more. The lines for rides were a lot more sedate than the crush outside, but even longer. They all clocked in around 1.5 or 2 plus hours wait per ride. We heard people with FastPasses complaining of slots not being available and long wait times as well. We spent our day in lines and only got to go on TWO RIDES ALL DAY LONG. The Disney app which is supposed to help you navigate the park and get updates for wait times for rides was worthless and 9 times out of ten did not respond or post any wait times at all.Food is another huge problem. It is close to impossible to buy it, even if you are totally willing and ready to pay inflated amusement park prices. Any food purchase involved negotiating massive chaotic    lines    and hour long or more waits. Several restaurants, inexplicably, were closed completely. There are not enough    fast    food outlets in the park, not even for low volume days. After standing in another chaotic line FOR OVER AN HOUR from 2pm to 3pm, I finally purchased 3 plain hotdogs, 3 fountain drinks, and 2 fries for 46 euros.  The employees at the food places really were doing the best they could. They were professional, cordial, and working as fast as they could in the face of endless, daunting lines and frustrated, hungry, sometimes even angry clients. Clearly behind their strained cheery smiles they were miserable, and who wouldn   t be? It was really depressing. I felt bad for them, and upset that I had given money to a company that treats both its customers and employees this way. Stores selling overpriced Disney merchandise, however, can be found throughout the park and, while crowded, are staffed so that visitors can make purchases. I guess selling merchandise makes Disney more money than providing park goers with something (anything) to eat. If you do go, pack your own food, everything your family will need to make it through the day. There is clearly something really wrong with Disney corporate culture that things have sunk this low. My husband and I had been talking about about making a trip to one of the US Disneyland parks, complete with a stay in one of their one site hotels or maybe even taking a Disney cruise. A trip to Disney has been such a rite of passage in the past. But after this experience, anything Disney related, anywhere in the world (my husband and I for once are in complete agreement) is off the table.On our ride back home, my son told us he had an    ok    time (I think he didn   t want us to feel bad knowing what we   d done to get there), but he also said that he didn   t really want to go back to any Disneyland again. It is only an amusement park, after all, and our crummy day there isn   t a tragedy or the end of the world, but I do feel the same way as my son. We won   t be back.","Negative"
"Love disneyland, had a great day walking around wearing Mickey and Minnie ears on our honeymoon.Positives: classic disneyland magic! Staff are all really friendly and helpful. Once you're on the rides they're great! There is something really special about the original disneyland that you can't find anywhere else! So much fun exploring the different kingdoms because of the variety and the amazing settings. Negatives: so much queuing   we probably queued for around 70% of our time there which gets real old real fast. Don't bother queuing for the haunted house, it's pretty rubbish. The food is insanely overpriced and pretty pants (also queue for this).","Neutral"
"A good amount of the rides closed for renovation, why close so many rides at the same time ? The rides that were open kept breaking down, I.e. Back stage tour fire display not working, crushes coaster (no fast tract on this ride) tower of terror not in use at 10.30 when we visited, most of the food outlets closed , those that were open only half the tills open. No reduction in ticket costs (euro 90) to reflect this, my wallet feels like it has been well and truly raped and pillaged.","Negative"
"We are huge Disney fans and have been to DisneyWorld in Orlando 5 or 6 times, so we wanted to at least give Disneyland a try on our Southern Cal vacation. Most of the park is identical to Orlando's Magic Kingdom, just on a smaller scale. It's clean and has lots of shade and trees (which Magic Kingdom could use more of). There was adequate staff around, and everyone was nice, but it just was missing that real Disney feel. It seemed more like any other theme park  like Six Flags or Hershey Park. People were simply there to do a job and that's it, no one seemed really into character, or excited to be there, to me. Shuttles to the parking area were run extremely inefficiently and you had to wait in a ridiculously long, wrap around line to get on at the end of a long day. In Orlando, there are several ways to get back to the parking lot, and they have plenty of trams to get you there. Much of the Adventure Park seemed to be under construction or something. And do yourself a favor, don't stay for the World of Color show. It is no more than projections of the Disney movies set to sprays of water with different color flashlights shooting through. We got Fastpasses to it and waited for the 10:15 pm show and were so disappointed. Our 6 year old, who loves anything Disney, was ready to go after the first 5 minutes.I do have to say that the food choices and quality are a little better than Orlando. But, overall, we felt it wasn't worth the $500 we paid for 2 day park hopper tickets, and we will not be returning. DisneyWorld is definitely the way to go.","Neutral"
"We came for Cars Land and Radiator Springs did not disappoint! We spent 1 day at California Adventure and 2 days at Disneyland, which was just right. If you are ready to spend a lot of money, the parks are ready to create dozens of Disney magical memories!","Positive"
"As Disney fans, my family have visited Florida for our main holiday over the past 5 years   we decided to go to Paris for a couple of days at the beginning of October as we had booked a week in the Paris region anyway. I still cannot understand how 2 Disney parks can be so different   I assumed that the Disney brand would ensure that the experience would be the same, however this is clearly not the case. There were moments where we agreed that it felt like Florida (walking up Main Street and during the parades) but it ended there. The staff are generally so miserable, rude and the service you receive is terrible. Customer service is not a strong point here. I felt like I spent 2 days walking through a cloud of cigarette smoke   people smoke constantly, everywhere   I didn't like the fact my small children were breathing second hand smoke every time we stepped outside a building (it really was quite bad). The food in the park was generally terrible (although we didn't visit the very expensive restaurants   you do still expect a level of quality). I guess we are used to the good quality food in the USA. Service was slow despite being off peak   at one point I queued 40 minutes for ice creams as there were 2 members of staff but only 1 very slow person working! Very few characters to meet and greet, we waited an hour to meet 1 princess!! Again this might seem normal to some people but when you have visited Disney in Florida it seems totally unacceptable.Disneyland Paris comes across as a very  tired  park   it needs work and money spending on it. Rides breaking down all the time, things not working correctly, many things need painting and revamping, its a bit grubby and dirty   the TOILETS ARE DISGUSTING!!!! Its the small touches like the princess meet and greet hall had features held together with duct tape   this would never happen in Florida where everything is pristine!! The run away mine train broke down and you could see them welding the track back together   the rides resumed almost straight away when they were finished. We weren't convinced it was safe so gave up our fast passes for it (my husband has read some interesting articles on it derailing a few years ago). As I said there were moments where you could feel the Disney Magic and we both felt that the fireworks and show at the end of the evening were fantastic. Disney has all the right ingredients here and there is potential but it needs time and money spending on it to bring it up to the same standard as the Florida park. Not a bad day out but disappointing if you have experienced a Disney park elsewhere! I recommend buying your discount tickets from Cite Europe (Carrefour holidays do cheaper tickets).","Neutral"
"So I've been to Disneyland a number of times since I moved to Orange County and while it has its perks, it's definitely not my favorite destination. For one thing, the entrance fees are prohibitively high and for someone who doesn't do rides, this park doesn't offer much in terms of enjoyment. Given a choice between Disneyland and DCA, I think I'd gladly choose DCA any day.On a side note, I did run the Tinkerbell Half Marathon in February 2011. That was quite an experience, not having to deal with crowds and having the park pretty much all to us runners...","Neutral"
"Weekend queues can go as long as 120min, believe it or not. Fast pass need to wait for 5h! With so many people and some sitting on the floor at casey corner to eat their hotdogs for dinner, you can find their restaurant Pizzeria Bella Notte closing at 6.30pm.! What lousy service. We understand the park is supposed to be magical at night but when night falls, the place was not well lit and pose risks for children, elderly and the disabled. The parades had shorter duration compared to other disney parks and totally underwhelming.Paid one of the most expensive disney tickets,   69 per person, but did not get the value. Tokyo disney was much cheaper but so much better in terms of service and experience.Would not return again.","Negative"
"We booked Disneyland Paris in January 2014 and were really looking forward to taking our 6 and 2 year old children. We had built it up to them for the last 4 months about how great it would be but it has been a big disappointment of a holiday. We stayed at explorers hotel which is a partner hotel. We enjoyed it more here playing in the pool! After our first day at the park none of us wished to go back there. You have to queue for everything, at 1 point the waiting time for 1 of the rides was 2 hours! We imagined the characters would be walking around the parks for picture opportunities etc but they only came out at certain times and points in the parks for a limited time leading to queues for pictures. As previous reviews have stated there are a lot of smokers in the parks which did bother me. We had a 4 day park pass but only spent around 10 hours in the parks as it was just a waste of energy. There are lots of toy shops in and around the parks selling the same gear and it is nothing special and is expensive. Food: if you love junk food this place is fantastic! As that's all you will get. In the end we took a train to Paris and visited all the major tourist attractions via the metro and all in all this was the best part of the holiday. The kids said they loved seeing the Eiffel Tower and walking around Paris. The funniest part for me was watching people turn to wild stone age people when queuing for a shuttle bus like they had never seen one. You could be stood at the bus stop for 10minutes waiting patiently with no one else around then 30 or 40 people turn up and just barge and push past one another to make sure they get on the bus and then when on the bus run to ensure they get seated for the massive 5 minute bus journey. Also people with prams not folding them up to make space for other passengers. We had a pram and folded it up no problem. 1 evening after watching people fight their way onto the bus we decided to walk back to the hotel which was around a 40 minute walk (with kids and pram). All in all Paris was fantastic, explorers hotel was average but the pool was great and kids enjoyed going in there everyday. Disneyland Paris was rubbish as were the majority of people who turn into morons. This has put me off ever going to Florida.","Negative"
"Apparently, certain people have abused the guest assistance passes and such to a point that those that truly have disabilities are treated poorly. At least in my experience, and a few others that I spoke to. After waiting in line at City Hall, I was turned away, and told I didn't need the guest assistance pass because I was in my scooter. The idea is that for newer rides you enter normally, others through the handicapped entrance or the exit. Our most recent visit was for my granddaughter's 4th birthday. My daughter, son in law, and 13 yr old. autistic son went off to ride the  big  rides, while I took my 4 yr. old granddaughter to Fantasyland. Many of the rides, like Snow White, don't accommodate a full sized 4 wheel scooter. When I started to go in through the exit, I quickly realized, people would not be able to exit, because the pathway was too narrow. Therefore, I had to get off and hobble in. Upon entering the exit and propping myself against the wall, I was asked for my assistance pass, I said I didn't have one, and told them why. They told me I had to have a wheelchair. I explained I have my own scooter, but its too large to maneuver through the line, so I parked it. A 3 wheeled rental would have worked, but not my personal scooter. I was told I had to exit. I insisted that I was in fact permanently disabled due to an accident and if they would just take 5 steps, they could see my scooter. NO! I must exit that line and stand in the regular line unless I have a wheelchair or a pass.My granddaughter began crying. She couldn't understand why she couldn't ride Snow White on her 4th birthday. I couldn't either! So, we got on my scooter and made our way back to City Hall, I parked the scooter by the fire truck because the parade time was approaching and the crowd was swelling. I walked up the ramp to the handicapped line. Believe it or not, I got kicked out of that one too, for not having a wheelchair! Barely able to walk up and down steps...I had to go around, stand in a line of 4 people (thankfully thats all there were). I explained my situation, showed my medicare card  proof that at 45 I am permanently disabled. Seriously...She still gave me a hard time! Eventually I just showed her my medical history on my phone, the large scar on my back, and bit my lip to keep from crying as I felt the last of my dignity go out the door. I feel the process should be similar to the DMV. While I don't think Disney has a right or need to know people's medical history or information, I do think a simple form signed by a qualified physician listing the physical limitations should suffice. For example: Unable to stand longer than 10 minutes. Unable to climb stairs, etc. This would certainly free things up, plus people that don't REALLY NEED the guest assistance passes, won't be able to get them.I purchased 4 premium and 2 deluxe annual passports from Disneyland last November (2013). Primarily because my autistic son enjoys it and its somewhat therapeutic for him. It has become such an UNpleasant experience at Disneyland, I don't want to renew anymore. What a shame. Can't help but wonder what Walt would think of how Disney operates today.","Neutral"
"I had my time went to Disneyland in Anneheim. Eventhough it was more than 10 years ago.. but seems Disneyland Anneheim is more attractive than Hongkong Disneyland. I also expect there will be more good play for the adults. Anyway this place is good just for walking around and spend about half day.. is more than enough","Neutral"
"For all the times I've been to disneyland I can honestly say I was amazed by the effort that they put into halloween with awesome decorations down main street and to a special parade. It was simply awesome. The souvenir shops were great with a fantastic range of halloween gear. I went over our half term and the beginning of the week was far quieter but by the middle of the week the crowds were growing as were the queues. The weather was on our side which made it better to deal with. There were no ride closures so we got to do all we wanted to. It was honestly great. Well done disneyland! ","Positive"
"I don   t think Disneyland needs my review, but I will provide a short one anyway! We arrived right after opening and the crowds were reasonable. As the day progressed the crowds increased significantly, to the point where it was difficult to walk around and all the rides had massive ques. Fastpass is the way to go when the park is like this, if you can get them. We did not plan our trip the best going in spring break right near Easter, but we are still glad we went. It was a magical day and as always all the staff at Disneyland contributed to making the day an enjoyable one despite it being extremely hot and busy. If you can go outside of a holiday period I would recommend it. We have been outside holidays before and it   s much easier to make your way around and do all the rides in one day. We had to miss a couple this time, but it was still great.","Positive"
"Having read some rather unflattering reviews before hand I nevertheless had an open mind on the day a friend and I went to the Park on a very chilly, windy November day.The train getting there is very easy. You can buy your tickets from the GREEN kiosk or if, as in our case, they are out of order go to the ticket window. Buy tickets   ours cost about 12 euros each rt   then go to the lower track and follow the well marked signs for the Park. The train was clean and we saw several passengers that were going to the Park as well but mostly it was just the everyday person going about their business. Trip takes about 45 minutes. The train arrives at the Station and as you exit the Park is right there so no lengthy hikes to reach.There is a sort of Disney Village with a Hard Rock Restaurant , shops etc on the left as enter. The main entrance is underneath one 'wing' of the Hotel. No line paid 84 euro each for one park ticket. Enter directly onto Main Street. Basically the same deco but was outfitted for Christmas with a huge tree nicely decorated. Shops on both sides. It also  snows  as intervals! We went into a cafe there for something warm to drink. Pretty adverage and bit expensive. Hot cold beverages, pastries etc. Then there was a Parade of sorts. Sadly, it was pretty bad and that was the only time we ever saw any themed characters at all. Not one roaming about the Park at all.Then we went to FrontierLand where the Haunted Mansion is located as well as Mark Twain River boat and I guess Big Thunder Mountain. Something was smelling wonderful    .. We went on the Haunted Mansion ride with zero wait time. The usual with some  French  Touches here and there and the Guide was very nice. That smell? Barbecue from the only restaurant open in that section. We read the menu: Buffalo Burger platter with salad, french fries and a drink totaled $40.00 American. Really. Needless to say we skipped.Next was Adventureland. Closed. All of it. Rides, attractions. Only things open were something akin to Tom Sawyer's Island and Indian Jones Ride. WE then headed to Pirates of the Caribbean which was open. It's designed more like a Fort in Port Royale and not in any way like the Park in California. I have not seen Florida so cannot comment about that one. Ride is basically the same with a few things added to make it more  French. FantseyLand next. The thing one has to remember is that the size is much SMALLER here that in Ca or Florida! Hunger drove us and the only thing open was a restaurant so in we went. Really bad. A cheeseburger, fries, drink and small ice cream was 12 euros each. It came cold but management provides a microwave in which to re heat. How thoughtful! Mostly full of families with cold and tired kids and parents' longing to go home.Next was the section like Space Mountain. Nothing to be thrilled there at all.The second and last Parade of the day begins at 5:30 or so and start to the left of Sleeping Beauty's Castle. This one featured 5 7 floats with Themed Characters both on them and walking. Best of the two. The Park closed this section at 7 as they have a fireworks show. We did not stay.Made our way back to Main Street did some shopping in too crowed last minuted packed stores before we left and took the train back into Paris. The Park itself is in need of A LOT of cosmetic work. Seriously.I'm glad we went because now it's out of my system and I can say to anyone that wants to gush about how they just 'have to go  Please, rethink! Spend your Euros on true Eye candy!But then, if you're a family with very young kids, who don't care about high prices shabby upkeep and horrible priced everything, then by all mean go.","Negative"
"We had a two day pass for two parks and it seemed to be enough time for my children aged 7 and 3. The park isn't overly big so that you couldn't see it all in two days. There were a lot of rides that we could go on as a family (the four of us) so that's what we enjoyed most. The waits for the rides were 30 minutes at most. Some rides were a lot less.We loved watching the Disney parade through the park, it was very entertaining. It finishes about 6pm and a lot of people leave after this so the exits are very busy.The staff at the Disney Park shops selling merchandise are friendly however the staff in the cafes seem very bored doing their jobs, they don't smile or even greet you. There is so much merchandise to choose from and we found the prices very reasonable.Security was very tight at the entrance which is very reassuring. Even though we went through bag checks we didn't wait a long time to enter the park.The place is magical and I enjoyed every moment.","Positive"
"Disneyland is magical no matter how you cut it, but the disaster of Radiator Springs was a bit too much. The ride broke down 5 times in one day, and we took a last ditch effort 5 minutes before closing ... we waited about 35 minutes and got on but it wasn't worth the wait ... or the stress of wondering if waiting at midnight with a 6 year old for a ride that may or may not be working by the time we get there, was a good idea. I felt sorry for the people who waited 2.5 hours!That being said, of course the trip was great and the highlight of our son's summer, I just wish we hadn't worked our last day around waiting to get on that ride, and going back and forth between parks to facilitate it. We were told that this ride has been very unreliable. Advice? (1) Go on a magic morning and have someone line up right away so you're there when the park opens or (b) have someone line up there while someone gets a fast pass at park opening (fast passes are gone within 30 mins or 60 mins of opening on a busy day (3) or wait until the novelty of the ride passes and the lineups shorten and the staff work through the ride's glitches.","Positive"
"Even better than we expected   Christmas time was magical   multiple parades, cold sunny weather, festive Christmas tree lighting and fireworks   loved every minute. Favourites were Buzz Lightyear, Alice's curious labyrinth and Peter Pan's flight. Mad Hatters teacups were also fun but Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was a little disappointing. Definitely need to go back as didn't have time to try many rides   just went with our top 20 over the weekend!","Positive"
"90 euros a person to get in for one day (two parcs) which is bad enough. Upon entering the parc we discovered that most of the main attractions ie rides were closed it seemed the only places open along with the minor rides and attractions were either shops or restaraunts. With so many parts of both parcs closed there should have been notification before shelling out all that cash plus 20 euros just to park the car and or a reduced entry price to reflect the diminished state of the parcs","Negative"
"Fully recommended even if you are 10 or 90. Really amazing place! Visit both parks (ticket for both 64    except for Weekends)and choose days such as Monday Thursday. Of course you will have to wait but most attractions have fastpass so you can avoid the queues. Do not miss:Star wars(both rcoasters),aerosmith rollercoaster,thunder mountain,indiana jones coaster,armageddon special effects.Everything was terrific!","Positive"
"Visited when it rained in the morning only lace to shelter is the shops.. None of the character s we're available. Parades shows were cancelled or delayed so long that ckids got bored. Biggest waste of money. Go to a non Disney theme park that has decent rides. Kids will have a better day","Negative"
"Disneyland is always fun because it is the most iconic theme park   it feels like the original. There may be better rides or better this or that in other parks, but none of them are Disney! It is like visiting the mothership of the Disney empire and there's some history there.","Positive"
"But Orlando Disneyworld this is NOT.  A great place for young kids to get some open space to run in HK, but the rides and park are all very small.  A perfect place for the you ones. And don't miss the character breakfast each morning,...More","Neutral"
"First, we had a great three day visit at Disney. The kids will always love it. However, it was my first time in a Disney overseas and I was really surprised that they don't maintain the famous Disney quality. The buildings had paint peeling, the bathrooms were atrocious. trash was all over the grass and walkways and the service was rude. There is no way this would be tolerated in an American Disney resort. It takes away from the magic of the place to see things so dirty and to encounter so many surly  cast members . That said, the rides are fun and there are the old favorites plus some new fun ones. We would go back, but I think Walt would turn over in his grave to see how they have let his standards slip.","Neutral"
"The day after the holiday was the best day to go.  Most of the time we walked onto the ride; but the longest wait was maybe 20 minutes.","Positive"
"Hadn't visited since 2013 and it lived up to our expectations! The scene was set when we arrived on Main Street and it started snowing   magical start to our holiday. We were pleasantly surprised at how quiet the park was   short wait times for rides and getting a good spot for the parade only fifteen minutes before showed this. Impressed by cast members tackling guests about smoking   this was appreciated. Cast members were friendly and helpful. We cannot wait to come back soon, thank you Disneyland for a truly memorable pre Christmas break!","Positive"
"Been to DLP many times but this was our first Halloween visit and it didn   t disappoint. Despite it being 27 degrees and feeling more like a summer holiday the amazing decorations throughout the Magic Kingdom gave the place an autumnal feel. The parks were busy but wait times weren   t long. A few of our favourite spots were closed for refurbishment but there was still more than enough to keep us entertained for the week and it   s got a unique atmosphere that just can   t be beat. ","Positive"
"We went for valentines weekend with our 5 yr old and 1yr old, had a great time, was very pleasantly surprised. I have been to California and hubby been to Florida we were not expecting it to be anywhere near as good but it was. Magical place and will go back in the warmer months next time","Positive"
"We went in early May with a large group. This is the  big trip  they take every year. Usually they go in June, but to beat the out of school crowds we went in May. There were 8 rides closed!! Most of them were the ones our group loves (Pirates, Nemo, Jungle Cruise). Small World was closed and looked like it had been for quite some time (leaves in the canal, no water). When we came last year it was also closed.The new system they have in place to serve the disabled is pretty good, but maybe letting people have more than one ride  on reserve  would be better. We spent more time trying to find the accessible kiosks than we did on rides.Kudos to the Cast members though, when one of our group got misplaced they flew into action and had eyes on him within 15 minutes :)","Neutral"
"This was our first visit and I had expectations which it didn't meet, but we had a great time and it was perfect for our 4 year old who was in awe. So although my wild ideas of Disney weren't met, it didn't ruin the day in any way. I expected to see characters all around the park but you don't, there are designated places where they or their friends appear briefly at certain times. So you can plan your day around those meet and greets as it's all listed on the website. The rides are not like you get in Alton towers, they are geared towards young children mostly so with the small exception of a few rides there isn't much in the way of white knuckle rides, again this was great for our 4 year old who could pretty much go on everything. Do expect to queue and as a British citizen do expect to have your feelings on queuing etiquette tested to the limit!!! People will push past you and your children without any care. If there is a long queue I would suggest getting a fast pass for that ride as you get on very quickly and take precedence over the main queue. The food is as you would expect, over priced not great park food, but the restaurants are still fun, drinks are expensive    3.60 for a bottle of coke sprite fanta. There is great attention to detail in the park and the staff are fantastic. For the lunchtime parade and closing show, people start finding their spots at least an hour before it starts so bear that in mind if you want to see them. The lunchtime parade is short and ok, not that special so don't worry if you miss it and take advantage of the shorter queues on the rides. The closing show however is fantastic, much better and can be seen much more easily from more places. All in all a great day, wear comfy shoes as lots of walking and queuing, have lots of patience and just enjoy seeing the happiness on your little or big ones faces.","Positive"
"The two parks are within easy walking distance of each other. if you plan your days properly you can get fast passes for both parks to get the most of your time there. Can get very busy and crowded in peak season. A lot of characters walking around to meet and greet. The park offers a typical Disney experience but as we only Visited the Orlando parks last year we felt that this was worth the visit but not a patch on the Walt Disney World!If you want to drink alcohol at this Disney and you are not an American citizen you also have to carry your passport around with you as they will not accept an EU driving license.","Neutral"
"This was my first visit to Disneyland Park and I was really looking forward to it. Every ride that I was anxiously looking forward to ended up being just OK. On my very first ride, the Pirates of the Caribbean, when you first start out in the boat you can see people dining to your right. The boat lingered there for a little bit, I'm assuming to allow the boat that was ahead of us to have a head start on their course. While we were waiting, a passenger on our boat told the story of how a child jumped out of the boat where we were because she was scared and I believed she severed her legs and later died. It was very sad and I was already a bit nervous. I didn't need to overhear that. Whenever we wanted to find an employee with a Disneyland uniform they were hard to locate. When I visited the ladies room, I was expecting employees be there constantly keeping it clean like they do at Universal Studios. I attribute my experience to one reviewer   s comment that the quality of Disneyland has declined over time. I believe there could've been a time in the past where my visit to Disneyland would've been truly magical, but maybe that time has passed. I had more pleasure in just walking around and looking.","Neutral"
"Before I review some aspects of the park which were disappointing I must stress that the four of us that went had a fab time and my 4yr old niece had a great time meeting all the characters. My review is slightly prejudiced as I have been to Disneyland Florida and the two don't really compare. Firstly I purchased tickets online through the official Disney site and was sent a letter of confirmation which I was told to present at the gates and they would give me the tickets. On arrival I queued for about 10 minutes at the ticket office to be told I had to go to guest relations to get the tickets. At guest relations there was a queue of about 14 people and I soon realised this is where people come who have problems with their tickets and as a result each person was taking a long time to get sorted out. I waited in line for over an hour before I got my tickets something I had to do on the second day as well. I saved about 12 euros booking on line but it was not worth the aggravation I had to go through at the park. My suggestion is buy the tickets at the park. In the park it was enjoyable but there didn't seem to be the variety of rides that I remember from Florida. Not many had the facility to get fast pass tickets and some of the ones that did weren't working when we were there! Food was of a good standard but very expensive! I would thoroughly recommend visiting Cafe Mickey in the Disney village. A lot of the characters come around the tables and make a lot of fuss of the children. Food is very good albeit slightly expensive. All in all an enjoyable weekend but could have been better organised.","Neutral"
"It's a good park, but nothing compared to Walt Disney World in Orlando. I have been to the ones in Paris and Tokyo too and Disneyland is certainly the park with the most rude cast members. They didn't apologize or told you sorry when something where broken or when they couldn't help you with something. They just told you what they thought and nothing more. The Disney magic weren't there at all. It seemed that they didn't care about you as a person that have paid a lot of money to get the Disney Magic. To me a Disney park is special and you expect happy and friendly employees. There were a few cast members that actually were nice, but far from everyone.Also, when we visited I celebrated my 30th birthday and we were on our honeymoon. We had the buttons for it but I can say that I can count the employees that congratulated us on two hands, and we were in the parks the whole day! And when someone congratulated us they seemed that they really didn't care that much.Another weird thing we experienced.. We got a fast pass for a ride and had the time 13:40 14:40 and we came at 13:32 and didn't get let in. The cast member just said  no, it's 8 minutes left  and pointed at the tickets. Sure we were early, but he could have said it with a nicer voice or used his words more wisely. Something like  Sorry, but I can't put you through before 13:40  should have worked perfectly. Remember that it was my 30th birthday and our honeymoon too. You think that the cast members would be extra nice to you then. But no. After us a family of 4 came that had the same time slot as us and they didn't get in either, it was 2 minutes left... Just wow. No smiles, no nice words or anything. Just  it's 2 minutes left . So not Disney magic. And things like this we experienced all day.When it comes to rides we enjoyed the ones we tried though. They were all good. The cleanliness of the park was good too. Food as you expect, expensive and not that great.A great tip: if you come by car, park at the Toy Story Parking lot and catch the Disney bus to Disneyland. It was so simple!","Neutral"
"In short. Hong Kong Disney has nothing to offer for Halloween 2015. Rather go to Ocean Park.Disney went to no trouble at for this years Halloween.The last time we visited for the Halloween program was in 2012 when it was excellent! A scary Haunted Hotel and other fantastic walk through attractions. Lots of actors dressed up in Halloween costume and mingled with the crowds. A wonderful parade of ghostly spectres dancing in Main Street......sadly, that was not to be repeated.2015 offered some really lame entertainment. Ghosts Rising  is a dozen or so actors dressed in white. They walk out and then pose for photos with the crowd. Apparently they are acting out a story. This all lasts for 40 minutes I am told. We didn't stay till the end, it was just was boring. The Haunting of Grizzly Gulch  has an old guy walking on to a stage swinging a lantern. Then 5 guys dressed in black wearing cowboy hats follow onto the stage. Next thing I see one of the Cowboys has a puppet horse...I had seen enough.The final Halloween attraction is  Curse of the Emerald Trinity.  It's the Jungle River Cruise, Done at night with a bit of green fog. Not scary and only done in Cantonese.I'm not sure what changed at Hong Kong Disney, but I will never waste my time to return for another lame Halloween. If they don't want to do Halloween for whatever reason, that's fine. But then don't advertise a Halloween program. My kids were so exited to go. We dressed up and left bitterly disappointed. Such a waste of time. They didn't even turn the pumpkin lights on down Main Street. Very sad.","Negative"

"If you've visited DisneyWorld in Orlando, your most enduring impression of HK Disney will be  small.   Cinderella's castle is about the size of an average size ranch house in the U.S.  On the up side, it's Disney : )  I know, it's not fashionable to like...More","Neutral"
"Just back from a family trip to EuroDisney Paris. It was everything I feared it would be ... but far worse! To sum up my experience in three words: Queues, queues, queues.The bad. The weather was unbearably hot, 100F, not Disney's fault I know this would not have been nearly as bad if it wasn't for all the time required to be outdoors queuing. I would never go again in summer. Food overpriced. Merchandise overpriced. Not enough picnic and play areas. Kids got bored and tetchy with queues. The good   the staff were all very friendly and well trained whilst doing a very stressful job with stressed customers. Felt safe on rides. The other guests were also very polite despite the sufferance. Shame that smoking was allowed in the park. I know outdoors but why should I have to breath in other peoples filth whilst standing in queues and watching parades? Parade good. Park buildings and landscaping lovely.Monday. I arrived by packed shuttle bus which was full to bursting and crawled through rush hour traffic. I waited 15 minutes to get my bag xrayed at security. I then waited thirty minutes to get my pre paid ticket even though the queue was short and the counters fully manned. Why is this process so slow when the kids are desperate to get into the park. I then waited ten more minutes at park entry. I then set off to 'Adventureland' and walked to the Pirates ride and waited forty minutes   which then promptly shut down due to a technical fault just as I was about to board. So we went instead to the haunted house which said 15 minutes queuing time but which was 45 minutes in extreme heat. Haunted house story was all in French and therefore meaningless. And that was my morning. In the afternoon thought about the Frozen sing a long but queues were prohibitive. Went on Thundermountain in afternoon with a fastpass ticket   it was good but still had to wait twenty minutes. Gave up with other rides due to queues and went to some of the lesser attractions instead. Tuesday: Walked thirty minutes to park to avoid bus overcrowding. Found secondary entrance with no queues. Went to 'Fantasyland' but Peterpan ride shut due to technical fault. Did a few rides but generally disappointed with the quality and length of rides. Not nearly as good as I'd expected. Waited an hour for the star wars simulator which was good but not worth the tortuous queue. Queues for toilet, queues for water fountain. Gave up and retreated to hotel at this point and returned in the evening. Evening parade good. Jaques Cousteaux future ride closed. Gave up queuing for Automania. Went to rockets instead   said 15 minute queue but was twice that for 1 minute ride. Laser firework show at castle excellent and highlight of show..Wednesday: went to Disney studios park. Rushed to Crush ride early to avoid queues only to wait 70 minutes for a 60 second rollarcoaster in the dark. Massively disappointed. Meanwhile, another family member had to wait 20minutes just to get a fastpass ticket for Ratatouie. Went to a animalmajique show which was pants. Went to Ratatouie which had just broken down. So gave up and went back to the hotel for a swim instead. Thursday. Had a morning before flying home. Tried to go on rides that had been unable to get on previously. But pirates shut again. When did return, queues forty minutes long and, unlike my companions, I was not prepared to endure. Went on 'behind the scenes' tram   which was just garbage. Peter Pan ride was closed again but then reopened. It was so dark I couldn't see anything! I'm told this is a problem in the summer because there is not time to allow your eyes to adjust! Summary. Any other company expecting families with young children to queue for hours in the baking sun would be prosecuted for child abuse! I don't understand why people tolerate the queues ... the park clearly is all about the rides and yet can't accommodate so many people. The same people that would blow a fuse if they had to wait for half an hour in an airport security line for a two hour,   60 plane trip seem to be remarkably tollerant when waiting an hour and more for a sixty second mickey mouse ride with their family   when they have paid thousands of pounds for the privilege. Everywhere I looked I saw strained parents and frustrated kids all frazzling in the heat. Disney are so sneaky about the queues. First you stand for twenty minutes in the sun to get to the entrance of the attraction, and the queue doesn't look so bad; then you turn a corner to be confronted with a cattle shed of people twisting back and forth hidden round the side of the attraction  thirty more minutes; then you enter the building where you spend another twenty minutes in corridors constantly going round bends but not knowing how much longer you have to endure. If anyone could see the length of the queue from the onset they would never join in the first place. I do not know how this place averages a rating of four stars; it's just not worth the pain and misery and the money!","Negative"
"From start to finish, this place is hell! AVOID! Here's a flavour of our day... Bossy parking attendant chased after us and shouted at us when we tried to park at the end of the row instead of the middle, where he then ordered us to park. Long walk from the car park with several of the travelators not working. Surly security guard closed the bag check for no reason just as we reached the front (having queued for 15 minutes)   caused chaos as the whole queue then had to merge with the adjacent queue. Smokers everywhere ignoring the no smoking signs and no one making them stop. The breakfast vouchers we were given were only valid in one restaurant (the other one was closed even though it was peak season). They closed a third of the tills just as we arrived, no doubt just to make sure that everyone could queue that bit longer. Badly organised service meant a 30 minute wait for an 'omelette burger' and a stale croissant. Massive queues for everything, even the smaller children's rides. Several of the 'big' rides broken down for long periods of time with no explanation. A 70 minute wait in hot sunshine for one ride. Nothing, absolutely nothing, to amuse the children while you're in the queue. The FastPass tickets are a joke   if you don't get them as soon as you arrive, forget it! We tried at 11.30am and the next available ticket was for 6.30pm. Hopeless, and definitely not fast. Nearly 60 euros for four burgers and chips. Hardly a sign of any Disney characters all day. Daisy Duck and the Genie from Aladdin   not what you expect from the ads. And the worst thing of all   we'd booked for 3 days, so we knew we had to come back and do it all again! We hid our massive disappointment from the children, but even they asked why it took so long so that they'd only been on 3 rides during the whole day. In our opinion, the whole place is just one massive badly organised shopping mall selling overpriced tat. If you want to shop, eat expensive junk food or stand in hot smoky queues for hours on end, then this is the place for you. If not, give it a miss. We're NEVER EVER going back.","Negative"
"We were on the way decided to go back to Mongkok for shopping but i saw many people were line up for the night parade. So we say good bye shoping and sitting in the front row. Day parade was great, however night parade was incredible fantastic beautiful. The music made our body dance hahaha really joyful moment :D I love disney character especially Buzz and woody.","Positive"
"Visit on 25 June 2017 with my family. It is not public holiday in Hongkong, but the place was still crowded. I suppose it filled with overseas tourist, especially from Indonesia, since there was long public holiday in Indonesia. My brother purchased the tickets from Singapore.The location of the park is on Lantau Island. Near the Hongkong International Airport. You need to depart on Sunny Bay station if you ride with MTR and then continue with the special line to Disneyland Hongkong.The first thing that I noticed that the station, the train was decorated with Disney Theme, which is kind of improving the holiday mood. And then when the train arrive at the Disneyland station, the MTR announcer say   Have a magical day Alongside the road to the main entrance, there were lamp with poster of Iron Man and other Marvel character. As you may know, that Marvel already been purchased by Disney, which is obviously a great advantage because now Disney can incorporate the Marvel character to their ride, which it makes the Disneyland cooler and help them to step a little bit from their kid intended ride persona. I arrived early at 8 O'clock After exchanging the booking confirmation with ticket, we queued to get the bag check. There was already queued even when the park has not yet opened. The weather is bad, with all of sudden the rain come. You should bring umbrella or raincoat. So after the bag check we queue at the front entrance. It is opened at 9 O'clock but the queue were already long. It is not really pleasant queue since the weather was really hot. There was ( which I thought a VIP family) who granted to gain early access to the park. And the family were being accompanied by some girl staff, and some Disney character and started to take photo at some landmark spot, while we still waiting before the gate open to the common people. And then the gate opened finally, but we still cannot get inside to the main area ( where are the rides located) It is opened at 9.30. I thought that is the strategy so the guest forced to roaming around first at the shops. Of course we will enter the shop since that's the only place that could prevent you from the dead from the heat. The park itself it is not too big. The rides mostly intended for kid, with no high level thrilled rides. There is no roller coaster with loop for example or with corkscrew. My favourite ride were Hyperloop coaster and Iron Man. The food here were expensive. For one plate of fried rice will cost you around 100 HKD. Despite off the portion was quite big ( enough even for 3 persons). The drink even more expensive. But they provided with free drinking water fountain in the front of every restroom.We did not finish all day in here since the weather is really bad. Hot and suddenly rain come. Even at the parade, there was a moderate raining. Overall this park is good for kid, since most of the ride were designed to accommodate kids. But if you are a thrilled seeker maybe you will be disappointed. But still this place is good for photography.","Neutral"

"Just returned from a family break with children and grandchildren, we all had a cabin each at Davy Crocket ranch, could not fault it. It was clean, spacious, well maintained and plenty of facilities. You collect your continental breakfast from huts and take it back to your cabin, the grandchildren loved it. The only thing that spoilt the trip was the attitude of the staff at the disney parks, they are miserable they couldn't care less if they serve you or not, they are very slow at everthing they do and the body lanuage shows that they are very un happy at what they are doing. In the Blockbuster cafe in the Disney studios one supervisor made the cashier cry as she was serving us. Although the staff done their best to try and spoil are beak we still had a great time. If there are any unemployed chefs go out to Eurodisney and show them how to cook, the food is terrible.","Neutral"
"It's Disney so of course it is amazing. We come here as many times a year as we can and we never get tired of it. Disneyland is the perfect place to escape from life. There are rides and attractions that will appeal to almost everyone from Star Wars to Dumbo. ","Positive"
"I have been to Disneyland a countless number of times. This time was unorganized chaos. They seemed horribly understaffed. We were herded like cattle through tight spaces not roped off for parades. Wait times are expected but over 2 hours for mediocre rides is ridiculous. There was garbage all over which just never happens in Disneyland   Not Ever!  Cast members  did not seem to know what was going on and seemed short and frustrated as well. At one point we were pushed by an employee trying to make her way through the crowd. I was waved to exit the park when I was trying to get to the lockers to get my stored items. We finally just left extremely frustrated and disappointed.","Negative"
"Despite the heat, the lines, and the high prices, Disneyland continues to be the gold standard for theme parks.  It has something for everyone and the attention to detail is just unmatched.  We love love love it!","Positive"
"I was in all Disneyland parks: Orlando, California, Hong Kong, Paris. We returned this year to the one near Paris with our children. The park is completely different from the attitude that we receive in the other ones. The employees don't smile, don't great you with polite salutations like everywhere else. There is a lot of stands of food and toys but no information anywhere and indications are not as clear to find your way around. The waiting time to get a meal was inappropriate: 45 minutes standing in a line for a meal of hamburgers with children waiting next to you doesn't make any sense. This was on a week day! Can't they find enough employees to work or are they just all disorganized? Anyway, nobody cared! and then the quality of the food is awful. I ordered later on a turkey leg which is one of the thing that my kids always like in the parks, and it was so spicy even though I asked to not put any sauce and it was so dry it was ugly to look at, not at all that plump and juicy turkey leg you find everywhere else, and so expensive! You expect fast food in a Disney Park but I always found my way around to get decent food for the different taste of the family, even at the park in Hong Kong, but for sure not in the France one! Also, the bathrooms looked so old and dirty that my kid didn't want to go. It was not a happy day like it normally is in a Disney park. I don't think I would go back to that one, it was just too disapointing.","Negative"
"It was Disneyland. You expect certain things. We had breakdowns on almost every ride. C'mon Disney. Been going there since the 60's, never been more disappointed!FIX THE RIDES! With as much money as they make you would think they would take better care of their park!","Negative"
"I haven't been to Disney in years. I only went because I have a three year old and our family was going. The only day we could all attend was a high peak day ( 8 out of ten crowds) and a really hot day. After returning and have a few hours to mull it over I've come to this conclusion: unless you're a sadist, or have a child, I don't understand why you'd go there. A family member paid for our whole trip (Lucky us and we were beyond grateful happy!) so maybe I just feel guilty that he had to pay so much...? I dunno. I did at least 30 hours of solid internet research and looked at every Disney  secret tips  and hacks video out there but no matter how well prepared you are, it won't prepare you for the sheer crush of sweaty humanity. And the lines   ooooooooh, the lines!!!! Insert horror flashback here.Things that struck me as odd: They don't offer double strollers (like Legoland) so you'll have to rent a locker or pack lighter There's not enough shade seems like really poor planning.They aren't equipped for the crowds   they ran out of  First trip  and  Birthday  buttons. Some of the workers seemed like they didn't get the memo they were supposed to be happy nice  friendly. (I'm looking at you, grumpy ticket lady.)I was surprised by how dirty some of the bathrooms were  again it felt like they weren't prepared for the crowds.The  iconic  pickle popcorn (CA  cars land) you can get only every 2 week or at least that's what I was told  why not have it all the time? My son loved It's a Small world, Pixar Parade (CA) and meeting the cars in cars land. It was a wonderful trip in that regard but the crowds & heat are the absolute worst. There are so few places that you can take refuge! I'd do the extra hour drive to Legoland almost any day of the week than deal with that circus again. They really need to get their act together in terms of crowd control especially for that hefty price tag. ;(","Negative"
"I am American and I absolutely love things America... grilled burgers, big portions, friendly attitudes, and Target, of course. But I have been living outside of the US for over a decade. As a result, my recent trip to Disneyland Paris (with my 6  and 8 year old boys) left me a bit shell shocked for various reasons:It's commercial. Not commercial in the  let's go to the Christmas markets in Germany  commercial. But in your face commercial where you cannot walk 5 steps without a food, drink or plastic toy purchasing opportunity. It was too much. Overwhelmed, we spent a fortune and single handedly boosted the exports of China.It's crowded. We went in early June so before the summer rush, but the throngs were so heavy that it was hard to pick our way through the park. And at peak moments (end of day parade, the fake  fireworks  at the end), it was a nightmare. And the lines were outrageous.It's expensive. The restaurants are also crowded and loud (even the higher end ones feel like a Denny's due to the constant churn of people) and staggeringly expensive. We made the mistake of eating in one of the park restaurants on the first night. The second and third night we ventured outside of the park into nearby villages and ate locally and superbly.Rides are hit or miss. On our second day, we waited in line for over an hour for 2 different, popular rides only to be told, when near the front, that they had a technical problem and will shut down for a while. How do you explain that to a 6 year old?The Sequoia Lodge was average. We opted to stay in a Disney hotel to have the convenience of being near the park and the early hours (8 10 am) for hotel guests (but note that not a lot of rides are open during this time. It was perfectly adequate   but very sterile. No coffee tea making facility in the rooms. Breakfast (served on couches) was a nightmare. Would I go back? I'd rather sever my hand and dip it into acid. But if my kids want to, then, yes, we'll probably be back. But this time, we'll stay in a charming French village.","Negative"
"We took to calling it  Disneyline , the lines are out of control, even though we had Magic Mornings we found the lines, the noise and the masses of people overwhelming at times. Waiting in line for absolutely everything was not quite what we expected   we even waited in lines to get into a line! Crazy stuff!Look, it's Disneyland, and I think if you get the opportunity you have to do it once in your life. But the reality compared to the marketing are slightly askew. I don't regret going there, of coure we enjoyed it (to an extent), but it was so tiring and so busy I wouldn't rush to go back. We probably missed the boat a bit too, our kids at 13 and 10 were just a little too old to get caught up in the  magic , I regret not taking the kids when they were a bit younger, I think we all would have got a bit more out of the trip if they'd been a bit younger and still caught up in the Disney characters and movies. I'd also suggest staying for about a week, we only had three full days to do both Disneyland and California Adventure, given the hectic nature of both parks, we could have been a little more relaxed if we had had more time to take things slowly (and this would have left us in a better position to deal with the lines!).","Neutral"
"Having been to Disneyland in California and Disneyworld a few times, we couldn't miss the chance to go to Disney Paris. It's OK but not up to their usual standards. It didn't seem to have the Disney  buzz  and excitement that we were used to. Not the same enthusiasm from cast members that we have come to expect. Almost an attitude of indifference Very little music playing throughout the park. Very strange. Having said that, the rides didn't have long lines at all the day we came, so that was a bonus.","Neutral"
"The park is very big, spent four days there and thought that was adequate time. The queues are very long around 45min to an hour each time. The worst thing about here is all the people smoking, I never once seen a member of staff ask anyone smoking to put it out and remind them it is a no smoking theme park with designated smoking areas, please Disney think of the young children and reinforce your policy!","Negative"

"We recently visited the two parks Disneyland and Disneyland California for three days. We had also been to Seaworld Legoland and Universal in the same week but more of those in other reviews.We are big fans of Dinsey having been to their parks in Orlando. if you have been to Orlando a lot of things will seem the same as this is where is all began. If you are expecting it too be very different lots of new rides etc go to California as this is the newer parkWe purchased City Pass tickets which give good discount and the park hopper feature although it is a stretch to do more than one park in a day and really enjoy it. This is important to remember dont try to do too much it will spoil your enjoyment and unless you have very resilient kids they will be tired and irritable by the days end.One thing the hopper ticket is useful for if one of you wants to be the queue volunteer. For example at the moment (it changes every day so check) The Cars land main ride is massively popular. Even the fast pass runs out before 10am. Day one it took me 20 30 mins to get fast pass around 9.30am I got tickets to retunr 7.50PM. The next day we went to disneyland then I took the families tickets to get fast pass for the radiator springs racers so we werent all standing in line. There is also a new starbucks just inside on Buena Vista so if you are an SB addict this can be your line up reward.We notice food has gone up a lot in Disney since our last visit and its not as good as Universal or Seaworld for example. $6.50 for a small hot dog $13 for a slice of pizza and if staying in the evening $9 for a wine !. They don't like you to bring food but you might be able to sneak a subway in or say you have special food for the kids. I saw another review on merchandise and agree if you have lots to buy Target  CVS etc but then again you have to hand it too Disney no one has made more gifts out of Mickey than anyone else they have lots of unique items whereas outside the park is more generic stuff.Last few things, have a rough plan it doesnt have to be military style (dont march the kids around to tick everything off it is a holiday) but a little planning will save you time and try to think about alternates, if this ride is full what's next to it.Our favourites all of Cars Land really well done (check out how it was planned in the blue cellar) California Screamin, Nemo and all the old favourites in Disneyland such as small world, space mountain, buzzlightyear to zap some aliens.Mickeys parade is great and also the new pixar parade at California. There is a hot dog stall in the Hollywood are so you can wait in the shade until the parade comes by.Lastly do keep in the shade and drink lots it was 100 plus while we were there and no cooling mist spray unlike Universal.Have fun","Positive"
"I grew up going to Disney, so I still love going as an adult (without kids). There are lots of fun rides and the whole park is laid out with a lot of thought toe great design.My personal favorite rides are Buzz Lightyear and Space Mountain, with serious nostalgia points for Dumbo and the Tiki Room.","Positive"
"I love Disneyland!! I have a season pass but I have to say if your planning to stay for Fireworks,don't. They have really gone cheap with them. If you're lucky to be there on a day that offers them,they last like 5 minutes. Yes, you saw that right,5 minutes. It use to be like a 15 20minute show is now down to like under 10 minutes.","Neutral"

"Have just returned from a weekend of hell in Disneyland Paris! Being a BIG Disney fan I'm horrified to say it was the worst holiday we have had. On arrival   We had pre booked tickets and still had to queue for hours with the people who were buying their tickets! What's the point of pre booking? We were then disgusted to be greeted by a rude cashier!Once in the park   Rides and shops shut. Many without explanation, even when you ask staff! we just got told it was closed, you can kind of see that as there is a rope across it! The staff member was rude and clearly did not was to be there. By the end of the weekend I was fed up with the amount of closed signs. Its peak season why so much closed? The rides which were open half the carriages were broke! which was causing long queues. The fast passes were ridiculous either sold out or too late in the day. So we didn't get much done at all, complete waste of money. We was not going to queue for hours for a 2 minute ride! Actually witnessed a staff member being very rude to a women when she asked him about a time on fast pass. The food and drink were over priced and not exactly worth it. 20th Anniversary? well this was a complete disappointment. Castle was closed off during the day to prepare for the show at 11pm (lots of disappointed people in few minutes we were there) only 1 parade which was not until 7pm. Disney Dreams was a complete mess. People pushing each other out of the way I was pushed and shouted at by one women for walking out of the crowd as was so fed up with seeing nothing!! Overall a complete disappointment & won't be revisiting!","Negative"

"This review is about Disneyland Park Paris, not Disneyland Studio Paris which is marginally better.We were very disappointed with our visit. The park had our expectations high yet we have had much better experiences at theme parks that cost 1 6th as much as this did, literally. The entrance alone was 400 Euros. The food is overpriced so much that it is outrageous.The park is outdated, dirty, and old. As one other post wrote, it is past its use by date. The motor car ride had mechanics on duty repairing card constantly, on the fly, and there were traffic jams caused by several broken down cars. For goodness sakes buy new motors after 20 years and fix it. The Buzz Lightyear ride broke down 4 times while we were on it! 4 times, I kid you not! The only new stands are the 4001 souvenir shops that are everywhere. The rides are few and far between. None of them are of the quality we expect after visiting parks such as Legoland (Germany), Warner Bros World (Aust), Wet   N   Wild, Seaworld or even Luna Park in Sydney which must be older than Disneyland. The wait is intolerable, not just for rides but also food and tickets. The staff are on the whole where rude and only there for their own social life with other staff. The exception were the grounds staff who diligently picked up the litter dropped by thoughtless people. Many of the rides were broken. We were there for a full day. We rode for about 10 minutes. We queued for about 6 hours. The toilets were disgusting; old and dirty.Although there is a policy in small writing not to smoke in the main areas this is not followed through and the cigarette smoke is outrageous, especially that the main customers there are very young children.This park should be boycotted by the general public. It is a disgrace and outrageously overpriced.Save your money and go to Surfers Paradise in Queensland.","Negative"
"yes it's Disney so it's much the same as Florida, LA, tokyo et al, but it cannot be denied how well Disney do their thing. Clean, bright, well kept, friendly staff (even in Paris!), run like a well oiled machine. It is expensive to eat and drink and it's hard to find a place to rest   i guess this is strategic  'keep the punters moving' as all the grassed areas are fenced off. It would have been nice to have a lake where you could sit on the grass, like Alton Towers, but instead you have to find a set of steps or a wall to perch on when it gets too much,which it can do. One gaping hole in the Disney experience is finding a little, basic shop that sells things like toothpaste   (I'd travelled overnight by coach and forgot toothpaste   the state of my mouth wasn't worth thinking about!) and suncream. The weather was glorious but there's little shade and I could see several people reddening up, including me. They need a small store where you can get basics, not these relentless branded outlet shops. It's very nice to buy a Frozen rucksack but I needed toothpaste. One other thing   nearly   11 for a hotdog! Hmm, this is not a cheap day out. However, if you like seeing kids faces light up when they see their heroes and heroines in the parade then this is the place for you.","Positive"
"I don't know where to start really.. Disneyland is supposed to be a fantasyland for Children with characters and princesses in abundance.. In the 2 days I was here myself or my daughter never saw one disney character. The rides were a disgrace, the queues horrendous, the staff miserable, the organisation poor, the fast pass idea is worthless and the food was awful and expensive and slow .. It really is that bad. I live in Blackpool in the UK and The Pleasure beach at   5 admission is infinitely better. I am surprised at Disney being associated with this place... But maybe they have become a big con too. I have been to Florida and loved it and have booked to take my daughter on a Disney Cruise around the Caribbean next spring but I will be cancelling that after this experience. I have spent   1500 for a 3 day trip to this so called fantasy world .. The only good thing is that we had the option of a fourth day but declined. How on earth can it be called Disney without any characters there... Even my 6 year old was saying   Daaad can we go, this is not nice  take a good look at yourselves Disney and do yourselves a favour and get the hell away from this place.","Negative"
"If you enjoy getting ripped off then Disneyland Paris may just be for you.In addition we found the majority of the Parisians to be ignorant, arrogant and bad tempered   this included many of the Disney staff. We have 2 small children and you basically have to fight to get to see the attractions otherwise you get pushed to the back.It is not Euro Disney it is French Disney and they basically dont want anyone else there.If you want to experience Disney go to the states and let them look after you properly rather than put up with all the expense and hassle you get with Euro Disney.The kids did enjoy it but, boy, did we have to work that much harder here to make it enjoyable. Very dissapointed.","Negative"
"We were here during spring break (which is over two weeks in Europe), and while we expected cloudy and cold weather, we didn't think the park would be 25% shut down.Frontierland is entirely closed except for the Haunted Mansion and the train stop way at the back. Star Tour is closed in Tomorrowland, half of Autopia was shut down making the lines really long, Peter Pan was closed, most of the train stops were closed...just to name a few.Extra Magic hours were in the morning, but literally six rides in the entirety of Disneyland were open (I counted), all of which were outside except Buzz Lightyear and Space Mountain (so it was very cold, and all the outside rides were wet).To add insult to injury, no concessions opened until 1000. Do you want a cup of coffee, a snack? Tough. And to clarify, 1000 meant they started opening at that time, not that they were ready to do business...that happened around 1015 ish.The characters, the general scenery...it was all solid Disney. The classic rides are still winners, Small World included,but given so many things were closed, little kids waited forever to ride things like Dumbo, while adults waited, rode the ride, and complained  that was just for little kids ...um, obviously...it's not a roller coaster.No significant food was available in the park past 1600 without a reservation (oddly, Disneyland has a steakhouse in Frontierland...it closes at 4pm!), so you're left with fast food or snacks. Even then, many of the concessions closed by 8pm, even when the park was open until 2230.We tried to enjoy it, really, and at points it was okay, but  okay  was as far as it went. Four days was probably two too many.","Neutral"
"We visited 11 yrs ago and then again this month. The park hasn't changed at all, apart from some new rides. The usual gripes are there, the length of queues, cost of food and French people being French but it still has the Disney magic.When we visited Space Mountain was shut which was a big disappointment but all the other rides up and running. You can Fast Track rides for free but there are restrictions. We were on half board plus, a free up grade when we booked, so our evening meals plus a tea time treat (doughnut and drink) were included. However eating inside the park is expensive so bear that in mind when booking. Everybody takes in bags, full of bottles of water and snacks as there are currently no restrictions on this.The park, when we visited was spotless, as were the ample toilets.Lots of retail opportunities, the shops sell everything!Two tips....don't pay full price, there are deals to be had and make sure you pack plenty of layers of clothing. We had to buy hats while we out there it was so cold, colder than home!","Positive"
"Easily accessible by rail.  Park is small compared to American parks and lacks many of the rides.  Small enough to do all the activities and rides in a day.  Fireworks show not impressive or outstanding.  If you've been to the Disneyland or Disneyworld, you will...More","Neutral"
"Disney are trapped in a nostalgia vacuum where they are no longer seeking to lead the entertainment market rather relive Walts glory days. By all means keep the Tiki room going but balance the historical with some kind of contemporary offering to show this entertainment experience does not only exist in rear view. Time to embrace the Epcot tradition and think 2030 not 1937. ","Negative"
"Of course you want to go to this park with the kids as all the Disney figures are in the park. But they need to do something with the lines. It's too long for children's to wait for an hour or 1.5hour to wait for an attraction of 2 minutes. Also the lines to make a picture with one of the figures... There must be a solution... Make some places where the figures come and kids can make pictures with them. Also with small children's you need 2 days to make sure that they can see everything, but the tickets are also too expensive. So to be honest... You have other attractionparcs where you can go with the children's... You pay less and your childrens will enjoy as well.. Create moments and don't pay too much too create happy moments if there are other parcs as well...","Neutral"
"Two of us went to the Paris disneyland park over the Easter weekend and had a really disappointing time. Despite focussing on getting on as many rides as possible (we even ate lunch in a queue) we only managed four rides in a full day (three if you don't count the haunted house)! We queued for an hour for Indiana Jones before being kicked off because the ride had broken down, Space Mountain was closed, and we were turned away from Pirates and Thunder Mountain (the first time we tried) because they had temporarily broken down as well!Although the parades were kind of fun, there were no characters walking around, the rides weren't particularly well themed (e.g. the thunder mountain and the haunted house didn't even have disney themes), and so I don't see what Disneyland has over parks that actually have good rides.","Negative"
"Having bought some tickets via the internet before we went to Paris there was a problem with the website and we ended up with tickets that were only valid from when we came home. Phoned told no refund but would be accepted by desk in Paris but may be a small difference to pay. How wrong   treated as if two seperate organisations and had to buy new tickets full price (would have walked away but children would not have understood). Apart from ticket desk all staff very friendly with fixed smiles but park was diappointng as so much closed down. A very expensive day, park catering facilities expensive and typical American junk food.","Negative"
"went there becos of my boy. was crowded and every rides would take about 60   70 mins of queuing. there are few rides that visitors can get express Q. however, this express tickets are not given out thru out the whole day. only for limited time in a day.","Neutral"
"The crowd in Hong Kong in general is rude and impolite and will not think twice before pushing and shoving their way through. And this trait of those visiting Disneyland gets heightened even more. The rides have a minimum waiting time of 1 hour. Often it seems people don't even know why they were standing in a particular line. Just not worth the experience. If you just can't miss this, then at least go after 3 pm. Most rides are open till 8 and park is open till 10:30. Disappointing and just not worth it.","Negative"
"The rides were great when you eventually got to them.Staff under trained teenagers on a gap year.Queueing, was well managed but then again you would expect that as they have a lot of experience in managing queues. OMG did we spend a lot of time in queues. Probably about 90% of our time there was spent in a queue.Pricing, we all need to make a living but really, Disney you are taking the mickey. Everything in Dysneyland Paris is about making money and not just a little but a lot. The hard sell the soft sell , the repetitive sell they've got it all and never ever give up. The only places that offer anywhere near value for money are the places not owned by Disney, Cart D'Or sold some really good value for money ice cream.Food, get with the program, do you guys not watch Jamie Oliver? EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING is fried, if they could deep fry pizza they would, 4 days we were here and by the end of day 2 I was craving apples like a junkie craves his next fix I couldn't stop thinking about vegetables, raw carrot, peaches, celery anything but battery farmed meat product and reprocessed potato starch. Even my son who at the best of time can live off pizza and chips started asking for fresh fruit. Spend a week here living in a Disney hotel and you will have scurvy. Apartheid, segregation, racism whatever you want to call it. It is a very difficult conversation to have. But Disney has forced me to have it. A lot of the things about Disneyland Paris reminded me of the long past age of the wild west, the food the pushy sales the waiting in line. Nothing reminded me of it more than the apparent apartheid. All the menial jobs were being done by people of African origin while all the front of house, customer facing jobs and management jobs by WASPS. Maybe this was Disney trying to keep in the style of the good old US of A 100 years ago but for me it really struck a cord. All in would I go back? NEVER. Did my son like it yes. Would I recommend a friend to take his children there ? NO, sorry Walt but you are stuck in the last century, stick to what you are good at, making great films.Top tip, if you want to meet the Disney characters, go to the disney cafe outside the park, great food and you get to meet all of them without standing in a queue.","Negative"

"First time to Eurodisney. Stayed in the Sequoia Lodge, couldn't fault the hotel, lovely clean comfy room, bus to parks right outside front door every 15 mins. Disneyland Village and Parks were magical places. Lots of characters for photos   our 7yr old got her photo with 11 characters who interacted brilliantly with her. Queues could be long but was expected. Staff in all locations were very friendly and pleasant to deal with.Disney Dream Show, Christmas Parade and Lighting of the Tree show were magical. Stayed for 4 days and still did not see everything. All in all an excellent holiday for both us and our daughter. Hope to return again soon.","Positive"
"If you are staying in France, near disneyland, and you have young children (and a wife who loves Disney) it is impossible to refuse them a trip to the wonderfull world of commercialism. Many of you who read this will no doubt believe that I am some kind of grumpy old man Victor Meldrew type. I am not. I love to have fun and, even more importantly, love to see my kids have fun. This year was my fifth grudging visit to Disneyland Paris. I don't like it, my wife knows I don't like it, so do my kids but I bite the bullet and go anyway. So, I hear you say, what does this grumpy old man dislike so much? Well, here goes   I don't like paying 74 euros per adult per day to get in   I don't like paying 66 euros for my eldest daughter   I don't like paying 15 euros to park my car   I don't like the enormous queues full of anoying French kids who all push in   I don't like the extortionate prices for horrible food (we did take out own food in this year)   I don't like the shops every 10 yards that sell merchandise at ridiculous prices   I don't like trying to entertain my young kids through the boredom of queuing for so long   I could go on but you get the picture. I accept that queues are inevitable but have to say shame on Disney for the rip off pricing on everything.What I will say in the positive is that the parades are good and my kids loved seeing the characters. Would I go here again? If I have my way then no but I will probably be dragged back next year. to those of you holidaying in this area I would suggest yopu consider Parc Asterix as an alternative. Much cheaper, great shows (dolphin show fantastic) good rides and really small queues.","Negative"

"I've been to all 3 Disney Parks    Florida, California, and now France. This was my least favorite. Some of the really fun rides for kids   Mr. Toad's Wild Ride and Alice In Wonderland are walk through attractions rather than actual rides at this park. However, Pirates of The Caribbean was amazing, possibly better than the other parks. As I read elsewhere, indeed the bathrooms were quite smelly compared to other parks I've visited and this was the only park where visitors have to be reminded not to smoke on the rides (I actually just found this humorous). In this  non smoking park , the designated smoking areas were completely empty because people smoke wherever they want to, so if you are horrified by smoking, you'll probably need to get over it before you ever come to Europe. One of the biggest improvements over the USA parks    the beverage selection    beer and wine are served at some restaurants. Overall, the Disney magic is still here and I don't want to be too critical because I love Disneyland and my niece had a lovely time, but I can't help compare my experiences with the other Disneyland parks and for me this left a little bit to be desired.","Neutral"
"The park is old and small. It feels like being in a normal American makeshift funfare than in a Disneyland. Majority of the crew members do not smile and look unhappy with their job and role. Food is expensive and lacks variety. Everywhere you go, the park is a vacuum cleaner that keeps wanting to suck up your money instead of bringing joy and fun. It should not be named a Disneyland at all. The worst of all Disneylands that I have visited. Don't waste your money and time on this HK Disneyland and visit a real Disneyland in Tokyo, California, Orlando or Paris. This is NOT a DISNEYLAND !!!","Negative"

"We found some cast members snarky, rude or blatantly uncaring. We encountered swipe issues with our credit card on day two and so spent the trip telling cashiers that it would have to be entered manually as it wasn't swiping. The cast member in pieces of eight gave me a dirty look and asked me why I was bothering to use it. We are from Canada, we have no option to run to the bank and get a new card issued during a 5 day trip, it's just not feasible. Other cast members actually challenged us and said no it wasn't and swiped it about 15 times then tried the plastic bag method. My concern came when the card was actually getting bent as this was unfortunately the only card we had brought with us. The cashier at the pin store called for a manager and they came and tried another pos machine. She swipes it a dozen or more times while telling us that of course it would work. Then loudly announces it was declined. I have a minor heart attack at this as I was monitoring our spending and we were no where near our limit. She swipes it and Murphy's law the damn thing works and goes through. No apologies, just see I told you so (literally). I was honestly unimpressed and at that point was so frustrated that I said forget it I'm done took my bag and said that I was not happy and explain I was supposed to be taking a customer service course with Disney next year but was reconsidering based on in park experiences. She congratulated me at getting a job with Disney. I explain I wasn't working for Disney, I love my job. I was done and the last comment was most likely really rude but at that point I didn't care. Disney needs to spend more money on cit a hug and re educating their service staff or lose their reputation","Negative"
"Children really enjoyed it (boys age 6 & 7) thank goodness.CrowdsRight form the start we were stood in a large mob of people which can be scary for young children totally surrounded. I was quite terrified of losing the children and them getting injuredSmokingAlso people were walking around smoking which was scary in such a crowded environment with cigarettes at children's head height, totally oblivious to the possible injury they may cause. QueuesDon't think we queued for less than 90 minutes for any ride. Arrived 9.30am & left 11.30pm and we managed to go on 7 rides shows in 12 hours. Very difficult with children aged 6 & 7. It was painful.ShadeSome of the queues for the rides had no shade at all. We had to disappoint our child who was desperate to go on the new turtle  Crusher  ride. There is no way we could wait in boiling midday sun for that long. CharactersThere were few and far between. When they did appear they were completely mobbed by everyone and kept moving walking on swiftly. This was dangerous as my yound child was grabbing on to them trying to hug them at the time as children will do! The characters paid more attention to unsuspecting adults 'patting' them on the head than to the children who were so desperately trying to get their attention. The train that they were on nearly ran someone over (they were being a bit daft). FoodWe managed to get in with the children carrying two tiny backpacks, I had a rucksack and my husband had a rucksack. We were never searched   maybe too manic and busy and they couldnt' be bothered. Food was extortionate even more expensive than Legoland. UpkeepWent ten years ago and they were really strict about not sitting on the grass. When we watched the fireworks at the end I noticed that the grass was completely trashed and bare in places and the flowers were trampled. RidesFast Pass great idea but only managed to use one as had to queue for 20 minutes to get one and the timings never worked out.Phantom Manor: Alright   spooked 6 year old  scary Pirates of the Caribbean   6 yr old  pirate awesome Peter Pan Ride   over far too quick needed to be twice as long for 50 minute queueThunder Mountain   boys aged 6 & 7 loved this ride  really fast Studio Tram Tour   We loved this as we thought it was just a ride in a trainStitch Live   Hysterically funny & very well doneMoteurs   Action! Stunt Show Spectacular (Lightening McQueen) : GreatStar Tours Spaceflight simulator: Very  old  now but boys loved it & thought it was real Les Mysteres du Nautilus   bizarre walkthrough like being in a submarineFireworks & paradeFireworks were amazing and the bits of the parade that you could see were interesting. However it was crowded & wasnt' really anywhere to get a good view. I had wobble precariously on the metal fence to see anything at all. Children need to be on shoulders. It goes on a while so it gets uncomfortable.","Negative"
"I have never seen so many Disney Cast Members with such grumpy attitudes. We found maybe 5 or 6 cast members who seemed to be enjoying their jobs. Otherwise they were sullen, rude and poorly trained. This really detracted from our much anticipated vacation! Disney also needs to find an alternative to their MaxPass. Granted without it we would probably have missed a couple of attractions, but in 3 days we only used it 8 times.","Neutral"
"Most amazing experience!!!4th time being here and the Disney magic is still as amazing as when I was a kid.Queues are long and prices are extortionate but they will be wherever you go.Beautifully clean   can literally lick the bins they are so clean. Fast tracks passes are free and are very helpful to cut down queues.100% recommend ","Positive"
"We have always enjoyed our visits and not having been for 5 years booked 6 days. We were all surprised at the way standards had dropped and the professionalism we had come to expect was not evident.Toilets were dirty, restaurants had food on tables and floors even after cleaning, major rides were closed unexpectedly due to maintenance issues to name a few problems.We queued for the new Ratatouille ride for an hour ( minimum wait 120 minutes) even though the staff knew it had stopped working. No information given so we gave up.Thunder Mountain was closed unexpectedly   no information, inaccurate waiting times announced for many rides so queued for one ride expecting a 30 min wait and gave up after 60mins, early hours for Disney hotel visitors was not worth it as few rides open with lengthy queues.I have always loved our visits and just hope that the management deal with all of this   it is in their control to make this a magical experience again.","Neutral"
"Disneyland is a great day out if you have never been there before, especially if you have children under the age of 5. But once your kids start approaching double figures you will find they get bored very quickly. Nothing to do for teenagers or adults. If you have older children do yourself a favour and take them to Ocean Park instead. Oh, and did I mention the food is inedible.","Neutral"

"Fast pass works ok for certain attractions (you scan your ticket and you get another timed ticket) but can only be one at a time.

"June 2010I'll be honest from the off, this isn't normally my cup of tea but with a five and six year old on a French holiday we bit the bullet and took them to Disneyland expecting the magic to materialise   it died after 10 minutes of stepping into the place.Fortunately we'd bought our tickets at the campsite we were stayng at as the queues were ridiculously long just to get in. That aside, we still had to queue to get our baggage checked and then queue at every ride. This day cost us over   200 for a family of four and we got on about five rides, each lasting less than 2 minutes. I've had better value for money at the travelling fairground that comes once a year to our local park. Judging by the car park, I'd say the place was only half full but the crowds were horrendous   you could hardly walk about.The Disney shops were full of over priced tat, tons of it. There was absolutely nothing that you'd have wanted to buy. My kids had been given   5 to spend by a neighbour and they struggled to fnd anything that cheap. In the end they got a small sweetie dispenser each. The part we were in was more just glorified play area, what few rides there were were just basic rubbish you had to queue for a minimum of 30 minutes each time. We eventually left at 5pm and even the kids were glad. For such young kids their patience was remarkable but they really were not bowled over at all. When I ask them about their favourite part of the holiday to France it was the swimming pool at the camp site, swimming in the river and the funny tunnels at the war bit (Somme Museum).A total rip off. Disney is just a money churning brand now   no magic left.","Negative"
"We visited in January and had no trouble doing everything we wanted. In busier times yu will want to pay extra to get the Fast Pass or ride single to bypass long lines. Disney is working on a new area which will feature Star Wars and open in summer 2019. In the meantime, most of Tomorrowland is Star wars themed. It is well done. The Nemo submarine is way behind in technology and really needs to be upgraded. The same for Its A Small World. The Haunted Mansion has been upgraded as well as The Pirates of the Carribean. My last vist was 20 years ago when Indiana Jones was The ride. It's still good. We didn't visit Toontown this time but that is the place to see Mickey and younger children will love the area. The Park still delivers on entertainment but meals are pricey. Expect a pricey day. If you can, book ahead and check out which rides are down for servicing during your visit. It's still a must do!","Positive"
"Went with my family to see high school bands perform . Was a nice warm day not to crowded so lines were ok . Every one was very friendly and polite. I notice they had more adult employees and not very many young adults working. Bathrooms were very clean and had attended working to take care of them. Which was very nice. All and all the park was clean and had employees that were very helpful.","Positive"
"I read lots of the reviews on here before i went...some were good and some were bad, so for what it is worth here is mine. We went in the first two weeks of August with 2 adults and a boy aged 7I LOVE THIS PLACE...sure there are down parts, but the good out way those.I saw comments about the park being dirty....i saw tons of people walking around picking up litter and it is defiantly the cleanest place i have seen that has to accommodate that amount of people...so not dirty.Every toilet i went into was clean and had loo roll.The people....every single member of staff i spoke to was friendly , really helpful and most of them spoke English which really helped...the ones that didn't laughed and joked with us as we acted out or spoke in bad french....so no rude people.Food...Yep it is expensive....but you dont have to eat their food all the time. We went knowing that we were going to have a few special dinners and prepared ourself for the cost. There is a section at the beginning near the carpark that you can eat your own picnic. To be honest it was nice to go there and have a quiet picnic during the day, to re charge and just take a break from all the noise.It is located at the end of the moving escalators...if you get to the entrance to the park where they check your bags you have gone to far.Queues...yep they were long, but i am not sure what some people where expecting who complained about them....my tip, use the fast pass...queuing for an hour and a half for a 2 min ride is going to make anyone mad....fast pass and find something else to do while you wait.Parking....A LOT OF MONEY...  15 a day...we went for 4 days...with 2 adults and one child...we found it cheaper to buy a year long ticket as funnily it turned out cheaper.That way you dont have to pay for your parking.The parades............amazing.....grab your seat early as you cannot see anything if you are 4 rows behind people. If you have small children and are planning on staying for the late night show...you will not get out of the park until midnight....so tired children.Shops are very expensive...you cannot buy anything under   20 so be prepared for that in your budget.I have to say by day three i was fed up with the cheesy music and the signs everywhere that says 'we will make your dreams come true............but overall, an amazing place and we had a wonderful time.","Positive"
"The park was Disney but it lacked excitement and sparkle of the Florida park. The rides and attractions looks tired and although the staff tried at times to be charismatic they failed miserably. The souvenirs were very expensive. The food was expensive too.Out side the park the Disney hotels restaurants were packed and the priority in some queues went to same language guests rather than who was next. The train around the lake from hotel to park was 2 euro each. Theses transports are free in USA!On the positive side my granddaughter enjoyed it as she's too young to know the magic was slightly faded! The lazier show at the end of the day was amazing and the best thing about the park","Negative"
"After a lifetime of wanting to go to Disneyland and hearing that it was the happiest place on earth, I found it Meh.....We went at the end of August so I should have known better, but oh my word the crowds, oh the crowds.....WOW..... it was step, shuffle, another step shuffle, shoulder to shoulder people, two hour line ups for a ten minute ride, pushing, shoving, rude people, standing in line, oh the line ups were so horrible, so long.Being terrified of losing your family because you would never find them again and I mean never.Haunted Mansion was shut down which was SOOOO disappointing, as well as the train.Line ups for food were so longThere were so many people we couldn't even see anythingIt was so hot you know being California and all, but some shade over the line ups would have been nice.Completely surprised that this is allowed as far as safety is concerned.I was pleasantly surprised by how clean the park was and how there were no line ups at the bathrooms. Kind of confusing actually.Don't get me wrong it was Disneyland so we did kind of have fun, no never mind it wasn't fun at all. It really wasn't but keep in mind we did go in August, so if I ever go back (I shutter at the thought) it will be in November.","Negative"
"As the title says this was our first time to Disneyland Paris and we took our very excited 5 year old daughter. Overall it was a fantastic 5 days and surprisingly seemed longer when we looked back on the train going home. Forget the reviews of things looking tired or moans of lots of closures   they are gearing up for 25 years but the beauty of some closures (mainly in frontierland) is they have more character meets which for a 5 year old was great. Some were scheduled extras like Tiana (who would not be there if the riverboat was running) and some were unscheduled and not listed on the programme. Example of these was Baloo and King Louis who were between Frontierland and Adventureland and because it was not listed had small queue. The same for Aladdin and Jasmine   they were not listed but appeared in the same place during our visit for two 45 min sessions over lunchtime. Character MeetsThe characters can take a few minutes with each person (which is great when its your go as it does not feel rushed) but it does mean queues can be long. We waited about just over 1 hour for Jasmine but our daughter spent most of that time watching everyone else meeting them at the side of the front of the queue which helped. If you have someone who is also princess mad then do spend the extra on princess meal. We had a lunch and she met Cinderella, Auroa and Belle (plus the Beast), photos, autographs and her highlight was their dancing. Whilst it sounds pricey   it very little more than extra you would pay for a plus type meal above standard prices plus with guaranteed multiple princesses (and saves any angst over queues for princess pavilion and has created lovely memories for her too).Length of stayThe park as I understand it is much smaller than the US ones but don't let this fool you into thinking you can do it in a day or two. If you want to do character meets you will need at least 3 days I would suggest as they are typically at certain times so you have to build your daily planning around them. We had 5 days and had a rough plan for each day with some options which were flexible around meets, events or fast passes etc. By being organised upfront we managed not to spend ages walking around from end to end. We typically stayed in 1 or 2 lands per day which maximised what we did and saved on all our legs. The 5 days was just right for us. We did everything we wanted to do (literally every ride suitable for someone under 1m 12cm) plus lots of meets and the Frozen and new Mickey show. HotelWould recommend if you staying in a Disney hotel to ask which characters visit there. We were in the Cheyenne which is cheapest on site hotel and Goofy and Chip & Dale were there everynight. We had already met Goofy on our first afternoon in the park after getting off the train so slightly annoying but forewarned is forearmed etc etc. Hotel was good   only 10 mins brisk walk to the park. It does need updating (they are doing this as we were there) but didn't disturb us at all. The room was comfortable but breakfast was a bit of free for all on some days (Saturday was worst) as it is seat yourself but it was much cheaper than the others and was only one with bunkbed option which suited us best.Food RefreshmentsWhat I had not read anywhere (and I did lots of research) was the limited options on refreshments. There were lots of stands etc but they all sold the same limited choice. If you wanted an ice cream (who would not in 28 degrees) you basically only had 3 choices (two had almonds and other was a kids ice cream) or a lolly. Drinks wise it was really only bottles of coke, water or minute maid orange. As for the Pause Gauramond (tea time treat vouchers you get with some packages)   I would honestly say it is a total con. There is literally no choice   a almond mini magnum or a dounut. Not so good if you are allergic or you don't want the same every single day. We came back with 4 days worth of these vouchers as they were literally useless. We ended up going to the ice cream parlour on main street instead and using cash. The Chez Remy restaurant was excellent and flexible on ordering main and dessert and even did adult portion of Linguini from kids menu for my wife. The theming is superb and the plate booth table was real highlight. Silverspur was good but had been moved to a plus restaurant from when we booked in March so cost us extra on the meal vouchers. Walts was good and watched parade from there one day but bill was expensive for what we had but was quality food. Our tip would be to book your restaurants. RidesFastpasses are great and free but on certain rides such as Ratatouille they were all gone after about hour and half. This was the best ride of the holiday for us. Really good use of 3D (wearing glasses) and some good effects like splashes of water when a pan is dropped so you feel slightly like it 'got' you. The rides which she could control such as Dumbo, Orbitron and flying carpets were big hits and she loved Snow White (4 times) and Peter Pan (3 times). Toy Story land in studios was great but Crushs Coaster was too much for both my ladies. Both upset but I won't say who was worse. It was a full on roller coaster and unless your kid enjoys that then if they are smaller then give it a miss and save the near hour queue. Two things I would not do again would be the train (see very little of the park) and not really effective as means of getting from A to B and the studio tram tour. This was very boring apart from 30 seconds of fire and water but even that was pretty tame. Nothing like you see in US and mainly just old props from films along the road as a filler to get to the fire set.Parades ShowsDaily parade is great. They change it every day slightly too with odd characters coming or going (Aerial was in some but not all) and some floats not always there. one parade had Mary Poppins Burt walking so we got to talk to them which was great as it was a favourite character already. Fireworks were brilliant   more light projection show on the castle (so do try to stand where you can see the castle including low down by entrance door etc as lots are projected there to tell the story). Frozen show was good but too much reliance upon using the film than participants singing for me but the kids loved it. The Mickey and the magician show was super too. Nearly didn't do it as not too fussed about Mickey but got us out of the heat but once we were in it said it had songs etc from Disney films. Essentially songs and characters from films 'helping' Mickey become a magician   so if you love Disney songs etc then definitely one to go too.OverallBrilliant. One very happy girl and two happy parents who enjoyed it nearly as much as the 5 year old.","Positive"
"I was lucky when we visited Disneyland because its there anniversary. I went there with my Boyfriend, we really enjoyed even though it rains but it didnt stop us the FUN! We also had the chance to see elsa and anna in their production at night. It was a perfect visit.","Positive"
"Disneyland was great!! The staff are great and I LOVED the tea cup ride (it is an icon after all) I would have loved to have stayed and see the fireworks. We got so tired trying to fit everything in so left early on our first day and unfortunately ran out of time to go back. We bought a Southern California Pass which included a 3 day park hopper pass to both Disneyland parks which I would highly recommend if you plan on visiting, (it also includes a day pass to Universal & Seaworld). Make sure you try a Dole Whip too... YUM!!","Positive"
"It pains me to give this 3 stars because I am such a huge Disney fan. Having been to Disney World in Florida a number of times, as well as Disneyland in California, I have come to expect a certain type of aura or atmosphere in a Disney park. I just got a completely different vibe here. The tangibles: the bathrooms were dirty by midday there were lots of areas boarded up which were not very attractive and caused us to take really round about ways to certain rides, line control was not as good as in the states, the rides were a bit underwhelming (Indiana Jones roller coaster is almost identical to Thunder Mountain, a short distance away).The intangible: I cannot put my finger on why but every member of my family said the parks just did not have the same warmth and  magical  feel that they expected. Every cast member we came across was certainly nice, so that wasn't to blame. I just know that whenever we leave the US Disney Parks, we are always sad and look forward to coming back. This one, everyone said  one and done .","Neutral"
"My daughter (14) and I visited Hong Kong Disneyland last week. This was to be her birthday treat. It was a very unpleasant day due to the heat and crowds. There was no evidence of the Disney magic as crowds of people sweated it out in queues of up to 50 mins waiting for rides. There is inadequate rides and facilities which are air conditioned. Space Mountain was good and Mystic Manor was worthwhile but the rest was not worth the effort of standing in 30  temp waiting in line. I don't know why they don't rethink the queuing areas and air condition where possible. We arrived at 10am (opening time) and already it was over 30 degrees. In summer, why don't they have an earlier opening time of 8.30am before the heat gets too bad?I had read on trip advisor that many rides are more suited to younger years and that's true. I am very pleased that we didn't take our 15 year old son. To summarise, this particular Disneyland is just a theme park for children 12 and under with rides that happen to have a Disney theme. It is aimed at locals who may not have the opportunity to travel abroad and witness the real Disney magic.","Negative"
"We visited Disney for the first part of our honeymoon and WOW it was amazing not just for children! The Star Wars rides were the best, left my tummy in the air. Food is expensive so take snacks $3.55 tax for a bottle of water! The Mickley pretzels were good though. Will definitely visit again.","Positive"
"Disneyland Paris is a magical experience for all the family, no matter how old or young. All the staff are great and friendly, and the parades are fantastic aswell. No matter how old your family is, they'll enjoy it. It was my 3rd time here, and I've always opted for Paris rather than Florida; mainly for the practicality, and I believe that it's very similar to Florida. Definitely recommended!","Positive"
"We're aged 26 and 27 and had a great day! Felt like a big kid on all the rides, favourite being the Buzz Lightyear ride!! Plenty of places to eat and so much to see and do! It was busy when we went but the queues soon go down!","Positive"
"We've tried Disneyland three times in the last two years. We accidentally went during spring break the first time we went for a day trip. Then we couldn't get any time of my husband's work except right around some spring breaks. Then we scheduled time off for what everyone said was the least crowded week at the park. It was worse than when we went during spring break. It's just too expensive and too crowded. They are relying heavily on the fact that a lot of people only go there to keep up with the Joneses, and on nostalgia. I know there's nothing else like it. But it's exhausting walking around the entire park... adding hours standing on your feet makes it excruciating. And the staff   either they were all trying to sound flamboyantly effeminate, which affectation of speech is so fake and obnoxious, or they are women who didn't bother to do their hair that morning and look like they are bored with living. Of course it's worth going; it's Disneyland. It's like visiting a monument. But not worth going again once you've seen everything. If we do go back, it won't be until Star Wars land is open, and then we'll probably just make it a day trip again.","Neutral"
"Queued twice for pirates of the Caribbean ride both times the ride broke down as were due to get on!! Disappointed it's a small world was closed for maintenance. Too many people walking around smoking and in eating areas, certainly not as clean as Florida. The late night firework and light show is very good and the food and drink wasn't as expensive as we expected. We did overall enjoy our 2 day visit it's just not Florida.","Neutral"
"I expected the park to be busy but not to the extent that i experienced. Bottom line, they let too many people in. Would not go back.","Negative"
"We have been t Disney many times and are firm fans, this was our first family visit to Disneyland California. We stayed in Paradise pier a disney hotel wish was average and very expensive, but hey we thought we would be on site close to the parks and have the privileged magic hour in the morning. Unfortunately as we only wanted a two day pass we were not eligible for the magic hour! We arrived early to take the monorail to the gate, but hey it wasn't working that day, or the next day, so we walked, no problem except it was quite a long way from paradise pier to the gates twice a day (we opted for a midday break back at the hotel pool) with two you children (aged 6 and 8) I was wearing a pedometer we walked over 10 miles both days in the parks!But never mind we don't mind a walk, we did mind the amount of rides that were not working though, the park was busy the lines were long, we arrived at The starters ride, but it was temporarily out of action, we went over to Buzz, the kids loved it, but the queue was long for early am, we then went to book the Jedi experience, but it was full, (10am) so we headed for atop, but it was closed for refurbishment as was the steam boat, and another part of the park, but it was also closed. We headed back and opted for the less popular younger rides, we got to the front of Roger Rabbit after 30 mins, but it got closed temporarily due to a problem, so we went through to a small world but the wait was over an hour, so onto the carousel, but it got closed as we joined the queue, across the way we joined the queue to something else, but this got closed too! by this point the kids were getting upset we had been in the park over two hours and been on one ride.It was a hot day so we said never mind lets have an ice cream, we ordered four but Enrique must have miss heard me and gave us three, one which we did not want, I apologised an asked for it to be changed and another added, and for the first time in all my experience of Disney an employee was rude to me, criticising me for changing my order, which I had not done. By this point I had had enough! We got the kids ice creams and walk them back up main street, to guest services, I was going to complain, (it takes a lot for me to get to this point) Once again we had to join a queue, even to complain!! After a few moments we spoke to a pleasant member of staff, she said we could have a refund or a few fast passes, we had travelled all the way from the UK, having booked our trip 6 months earlier, we did not know that so many things would be closed for refurb at the time, but even allowing for this we did not expect to line up so many time to then be told the ride was temporarily suspended. We went back to the hotel had a swim and some food and returned later on, to try again, but by this point the queues were still long and other things had closed, albeit temporarily, this time it was the haunted house, the queue to see mickey and minnie were still 60 minutes, and even with the fast passes we were all quickly loosing the will to continue. We returned to the hotel tired and fed up. A very sad day day, as the Magic had gone! An expensive dissapointing and miserable day.","Negative"
"This is entertainment at its very best, and caters for all ages. You have to be prepared to walk for Britain, but it is very worth it. Everywhere you look there is something going on, parades, shows, characters and what strikes you is that everyone appears to be having lots of fun, particularly the staff. They all have smiles on their faces, always!The main parade is particularly impressive, and the smaller ones are worth a look as well. Popular rides do get very busy, with long queues, but these can be avoided with a bit of forward planning using the    fast pass    system.","Positive"
"We first went when my children were tiny and have returned several times throughout their childhood. This was a belated 21st birthday visit for one of them and the whole family enjoyed the day. The queues we'd had in the past weren't an issue especially with 'Fast Passes'. We enjoyed it all I just wished the fireworks had been a little bit earlier than 11pm  I was exhausted by 10pm!","Positive"
"For me nothing speciel, and Disney land is to small, compare with the other park in Europe. I didnt like to are not allow to take water etc, inside like in Paris, but accepted it, but then they should lower the price.Our daughter on 5 love it, so what to do as long she was happy","Neutral"
"Yep, it's expensive (but surprisingly cheaper than Anaheim) but we had a great time. The weather was a little rainy and there was not a big crowd which made it nice. We enjoyed the rides, some a little different than we have in California. Loved the dragon under the castle. Loved the hall with the Statue of Liberty tributes. Food is pretty good, not cheap. Go eat at the Videopolis. Lots of the restaurants close early so make sure you know where you are going to eat and when. Get reservations. No churros   get a crepe. We liked the Cinemagique over at the Walt Disney Studios park too. It was great.","Positive"
"We were able to go to Disneyland with 10 of our grandchildren, ages 2 18 and their parents. Some of them have been before and for some it was their first visit. There is something for everyone! Old favorites and new experience on the horizon.bwe used the fastpass system and were able to experience everything we wanted to. It did feel more cramped with so much construction. My husband who had not been for many years enjoyed the fact there was so many places to sit.","Positive"
"Disneyland is wonderfully built with everything themed right down to the food served in each world. There are some fun rides for younger children and the characters are fun. BUT: It is ridiculously overcrowded and the fast pass system nowhere near as effective as the one at Universal Studios. If you haven't dreamed of going the wonderful world of Disney for years, if you can get over queuing min 20 minutes (even with a fast pass) for a ride and over 60 for those rides without (you can only hold one fast pass at a time), can manage with at least two major rides broken down on the only day you'll ever go   then I'm sure you will love it. For us, we could appreciate the time, creativity and artistry that's gone in to the place   but it's basically a very beautiful and overcrowded human zoo or maybe cattle yard. Did not live up to the dream. Incredible what a brand makes people prepared to accept. Disney could seriously do with restricting daily visitor numbers and the entire experience would be enhanced.","Neutral"
"It was a solo trip & the park has some amazing rides. Roller coaster in complete dark where you dont get courage to take your hands out. 7D iron man experience, fighting with enemies & feel the ship falling,heat, storm & water. Rides where everything becomes alive with movie type scene creation. Other rides like Winnie the pooh, toy story are also very nice. River safari was amazing.Benefits of being single that you dont have to wait in lines.For some rides there is a different line for solo peoples.","Positive"
"I recently went to Disneyland earlier this month and had an amazing time and experience on the  Happiest Place on Earth . It truly was a happy place. I was there nearly a decade ago for their 50th anniversary and they have stepped up their game. I loved every minute of the experience at both parks. Go early and get fast passes early for rides. I rode a little bit of everything and liked it all. Plan to walk a lot and plan on moderate waiting lines.","Positive"
"I have visited Disneyland as a child and in my 20s. I loved this place and remember it being magical. I wanted my kids to experience the same. I could look past the how expensive it was for tickets, expensive parking, expensive souvenirs, the terrible food that cost an arm and a leg if the experience was worth it....which it wasn't. It was over crowded, places were a mess, Space Mountain was closed, and lines were ridiculously long for everthing. We waited 40 minutes for 2 cups of coffee that cost $8. I don't know if we would ever come back.","Neutral"
"My family of 6 just went to Disneyland, we haven't been in years. I was floored to see the price of admission. $87 for one park or $125 for a park hopper. Needless to say it hits the pocket book FAST. A friend told me about ticketsinc1.com they have hopper tickets for just $99. With a savings of $26 per person, we were able to enjoy both parks get a turkey leg and buy a souvenir. Awesome!","Positive"
"Sorry to say but our recent visit was terrible, we'd bought tickets on line costing 84    for two day tickets. When we went to pick them up we ended up being told they were not valid for July, we had to pay an additional 79    to get in. To make matters worse we could not even visit the other park that would have been an extra 40    each. I've written an email yo Disney but as expected no reply at all apart from an automated response. The 160    for one park was a joke and 5    for a medium size packet of crisps..their robbing a lot of visitors.Just go prepared..","Negative"

"We are from the Gold Coast so spoilt with amazing theme parks but had to tick off Disneyland while in Hong Kong. The place is very well done but hardly any rides and a very small park. The rides they did have we're more geared up for toddlers which is Disneys target market.If you have teenagers I wouldn't suggest it. My kids were very disappointed.","Negative"
"Absolutely loved the park. Hard to seperate a favourite between here and CAP, both different and great in their way; just go to both with a park hopper.Being from Australia, comparing Disney to Australian theme parks is like chalk and cheese. Will be back ASAP. Can't wait for star wars land.","Positive"
"We visited Disneyland Paris for a 3 day break so we had an evening, a full day and a morning in the park. With us we had 4 children aged 7, 4, 1.5 and 3 months. If you are staying off resort I would recommend turning up earlier than 10am as although the main entrance was quiet, there were long queues at security outside the main gate where your bags are searched. We were staying at a resort hotel so got early entry. It wasn't particularly worth it though as most of the attractions were still closed until 10am.As we went in the off season (June) many of the food outlets were closed which led to extreme queues around lunchtime and a lack of places to sit. Two of us with babies dared to sit waiting for the rest of our party to get the food as both the babies needed fed which led to us being shouted at by a member of staff even though it wasn't busy when we entered. Food was of decent quality but easily twice the price of regular fast food outlets. Toilet facilities were plentiful but very poorly maintained. There was a stench of stale urine throughout all the toilets we visited, sanitary bins were overflowing (onto the floor in some cases) and they were generally much dirtier than we would have expected at an attraction of such a premium cost. The baby facility was excellent with chairs for feeding baby, water and microwaves for bottles if you need them, highchairs for feeding baby and a clean changing area with child sized toilets. Would recommend bringing younger children here over the main toilets.In terms of queueing for rides, we found Baby Switch extremely useful for the little ones. This allowed half of our party to queue while the rest waited with the babies. We then were able to swap over without half of the party having to wait. This is available on all fast pass attractions but it's not widely advertised so ask about it. We didn't find Fast Pass particularly useful as often when busy later on in the afternoon your slot would be some 3 4 hours away and it just isn't feasible to wait that long in the evening with babies in tow. We really enjoyed the 20th anniversary parade.Having visited Disneyland in California many years ago we were extremely disappointed by the lack of characters circulating the park. My daughter had bought an autograph book and was excited to meet Mickey and various others but really the only option to meet the characters was to join the 90 minute line for Meet Mickey or the Princess Pavillion. We were lucky in that we were staying at the Davy Crockett Ranch so they got to meet Mickey, Donald and Pluto on site there instead and got to spend a decent amount of time with them.Overall we would definitely return but if it's this busy off peak then I dread to think what it would be like during school holidays!","Neutral"
"This was our first family experience of Disneyland, and whilst good was probably not comparable with the US parks. I'm saying this as it was easily covered in a day. For the younger kids it's great, but post 6 or 7 the rides are limited. That said, we still had a great day and the ambience is magical. My son is 8 going on 9 and loved the day. The rides are clean and the place is well staffed. The park was packed when we attended as it was the day after a public holiday, and the heat was oppressive. But we still had a great but very tiring day. Having been to Ocean Park, for older kids and whilst it's not as polished as Disney, it has bigger rides that will better suit them.","Positive"
"Sicuramente un bel divertimento per i bambini e per i grandi che hanno voglia di sognare!  Ottimil soggiorno nei Disney Hotel!  Definitely a lot of fun for the kids and for the greats who have desire to dream!  Ottimil stay in Disney hotels!","Positive"
"The magic of Disney meets unimaginable line ups and unavailable broken rides. Grizzly River ride? ClosedIndiana Jones ride? Broken down when we arrived. Came back later when it was fixed. Wait in long line. Breaks again. Leave. Come back again when fixed. 50 minute wait, no more Fast Passes available. Radiator Springs Racer ride? 1 hr 50 minute wait   no Fast Passes available. Tower of Terror ride? 50 minute waits. Haunted Mansion? Broken closed in the morning (no reason given)Tom Sawyer Island? Closed. It goes on. Add to this the gross prices for simple food and it encourages guests to leave. For us (family of five). Flights from Canada ($$), hotel ($$), Disneyland Park Hopper Passes ($$)   all to find closed and broken rides and unreasonable prices and huge waits on site is a bit much to take. Very poor value for our family vacation. To be fair, the spirit of Disney still lives but is lost in the overall experience and inability to enjoy attractions.","Neutral"
"Purchasing tickets the day before online would have saved us $30 per ticket. It appears you might have more trouble entering (as we observed), but it will be cheaper. While far superior to Disney Hong Kong, if you're accustomed to Orlando, go back there. Just like if you're used to skiing in Colorado, don't try Wisconsin, you've been ruined.Paris park is beautiful, however, Christmas is done very well... Down to the details.We paid 303     (for 4 tickets) but are sorry we didn't buy them online the day before for     194. Our hesitation was that we didn't have a printer. So, online tickets are cheaper but must be purchased the day before!","Neutral"

"Disneyland Park is just the ultimate playground for kids and adults alike.

"Celebrated my special needs Aunts 60th Birthday at the park. It was an amazing time. We enjoyed the park from the morning until closing. The Fantastic show was spectacular. I would highly recommend seeing it. The fireworks were cancelled the night we were at the park due to winds, so I was disappointed I didn   t get to see them up close. But I did she them when over in California Adventure Park. The cast members are amazing. My aunt was spoiled by all of them. It was the birthday of a lifetime. She will never forget it.","Positive"
"As a frequent visitor of both Disney World and Disneyland, I can say that there is no magic at Disneyland Paris. A place that is supposed to be the  happiest on earth  left me frustrated and feeling like I completely wasted my precious euros. The most common phrase at Disneyland Paris is  technical difficulties.  Nearly even ride we tried to go on was closed for this reason when we arrived or while we waited online. I literally was able to get on two to three rides at this park. Space Mountain was not open when we got there, Buzz Lightyear was closed due to technical difficulties, so was Pirates, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad closed for this reason while we were waiting after returning with our Fast Pass . . . I've never seen anything like this in all my years of visiting Disney World. The staff will give you passes to skip the lines or fast passes if you complain, but this is simply not enough since these rides are likely to have technical difficulties when you come back to skip the line. For those who have not had the pleasure of visiting Disney in the USA, you may not realize how incredible at Disney experience truly can be. Save your money and visit Disney World. At Disney World, the rides run consistently, the employees go out of their way to make your experience magical, the restaurants are better and offer a range of price options and even the souvenirs are better! This park does not deserve your business until it improves how it takes care of its rides and the attitudes of its employees.","Negative"
"Let me start by saying that I have been to Disneyland before and loved it, but this time it was just way to crowded. I was with small children and I can honestly say I didn't feel safe. I couldn't even get my stroller through the crowds, and I was too afraid to let my little one out of the stroller    because he could get lost in two seconds with all the people swarming.I'll be back, but not in the summer and not on a weekend.","Neutral"
"Do not go on a weekend. We went on a Thursday and it was pretty much quiet, and easy going. Our longest line up was 10 minutes. Compared to California Disney some of the rides were low budget ex: Indiana Jones, Nautilis... And some of the rides were missing entirely   Splash mountain. There was construction and a few rides were closed do to it.   Big Thunder Mountain. Over all we had a fun time, there were lots of characters running around and a parade. Space Mountain 2 was wild and so was the Aroesmith Roller Coaster. We saw super cool stunt show by Renault, and a crazy Tarzan show with great acrobatics.We had fun, but it didn't quite compare to Disney California.","Neutral"

"As said on the title, it is not worth going to the Hong Kong Dinseyland if you had been to another Disneyland. This one is just too small. The same stuff with even smaller scale. The most disturbing thing is that the queue is outrageous for the main rides. And the recently opened area's ride had broke down multiple times.Still if you are first time being at Dinseyland, then you may enjoy it. There is some exclusive for this park like the Toy Story Land, the Iron Man thingy(which is not open yet)etc.Getting there is easy as well, just get to any MTR station and buy a ticket and you will be there in no time. Where Your Nightmares Come True.  is my ultimate comment for this park.","Neutral"
"This is my first ever disney experience! The sceneries, atmosphere, and the settings are def incredible! Waited 2 hours to take photos with the Princess. So much things to see, so much characters to meet, and I think the parade of the characters were little short though. A great day ends with the magical show at night before closing. We also spent some time going over to the Disney studios for rides! Overall, I feel like I'm back to my childhood days, really had a great time. A day is really not enough!","Positive"
"This is one of the smallest Disneyland's however it was still quite expensive for a one day visit. We went mid week to avoid the weekend crowds however it was still very busy. The queues for the rides were long with an average wait of about 30 minutes. I would recommend going when it just opens and doing the popular rides first as the queues will be shorter then. ","Neutral"
"Just back from 3 days at Disneyland what should have been a pleasant experience but ended up with a very annoying 3 days .As several attractions were under renovation ( such as Peter Pan ) or due to technical problems even closed for several hours ( such as Ratatouille ) the crowd focused on those that were open with result of long cues and waiting times of up to 3 hours .Unacceptable experience and never again .","Negative"
"We visited Disneyland in Dec 2011 and although we enjoyed the whole Christmas experience (complete with fake snow on main street) I was really disappointed at the sameness of all the shops, of which there were several, They all looked individual nd appealing from the outside but literally they all sold exactly the same things. I have visited disneyword Florida and would not say the two are on the same sheet. That said we travelled with a 6 & 4 yr old who had a great time, I think teenagers would struggle to stay amused. I really like the new York hotel althought the drinks were very expensive. Breakfast was really nice nd no long queues. The Christmas parade was wonderful and the lights and music very festive. The Eurostar could not have been easier and the Disney luggage service meant we were able to go straight to the park without any baggage or worries.","Neutral"
"We travelled from Australia to California to tick Disneyland   California Adventure Park off our  must do once in our lifetime  list & were not disappointed. Although not a lot of big thrill rides there is so much other stuff to do. The attention to detail is amazing, the staff were friendly & helpful and the shows of a high standard. We went in mid January & we hardly waited in queues at all & walked straight onto a lot of the smaller rides. Based on our 4 day experience (2 days in each park) we suggest you go on the Cars Ride, Space Mountain, Soaring Over California & Toy Story at least once although everyone enjoys different rides. If you have a younger child go to the Jedi Training Academy (we have an 11 & 8 year old) & don't miss The World of Colour, the fireworks & parade. Being new the Cars ride had the longest queue times so as we had access to the extra magic hour (we stayed at the Disneyland Hotel & we could get into alternate parks an hour earlier each morning) we went straight there & it only took 20 minutes. One slight downside was that food was not great & a bit expensive. As you can tell we had a great time & loved it & can now tick this off our bucket list!!!!","Positive"
"It was almost impossible to get any food as the majority of food outlets were closed. In fact we only found one open. We had to leave the park early as all of the mens toilets were closed and the ladies were filthy. The staff were also rather rude. Nowhere near as good as orlando.","Neutral"
"A lot of the rides we wanted to go on were closed.The Disney Character lines were long and then a hostest closed the line has we were about to get an autograph and said   back in 30! Staff was rude and rides broke down half way through.Not a magical first Family Vaca.","Neutral"
"I wonder if Disney corporation is name only as nothing like 2 other parks. Filthy, allows smoking, and butts cover the ground. Cups, food left laying where people put down, rotten wood, terrible need of paint all around. Florida park has workers designated to do nothing but walk around and pick up trash. CA park older but clean. Paris park is filthy, dirty, and rides are poorly run. Needs major overhaul in loading procedures. Problem is as long as park makes money, no one will do anything.","Negative"
"Fast Pass not very helpful with long lines at popular attractions.  Just saw that the prices are going up again!","Neutral"
"Great place, as expected. Young kids loved it. Stayed in the Wild West style accommodation.   But where is Matt?!  Andy","Positive"
"We were not sure what to expect here and were a little hesitant but these reservations were blown out of the water. Our son has autism and sensory issues so we contacted the park to ask about assistance with this, turns out that with an official stamped doctors letter that we could get an access pass. On arrival we found city hall armed with all sorts of paperwork but they accepted the doctor   s note without question and we got our pass, what a lifesaver it turned out to be. It let us bypass the main queues and use the disabled entrance, there   s still a bit of waiting and if it   s really busy they book you a time to come back. Anyone with an understanding of autism will appreciate the value of this. This pass can be picked up at the Donald desk to the right of the main entrance before the exit gates.The park itself is truly magical and I   ve never come across more helpful staff, everything is guest focussed. Some of the rides were shut for work, it being out of season but the boys really enjoyed it even if there was some sensory overload. We both really enjoyed the park as well. The meet and greets were great fun, we has lunch at Caf   Micky and all the characters come round for cuddles and photos and sing happy birthday. The Star Wars march was highly entertaining and the daily parade around 5 was great with lots of Disney themed performers and vehicles. We managed to keep the boys awake one night and watched the Disney dreams show which was great fun with sound, light and fireworks.The place is however all about making money as well and nothings cheap e.g. 9euro for a balloon. Buggies strollers are 20 euro a day to rent, we took an old one with us but somebody stole it, city hall gave us a complimentary one without question and it seems to be a common occurrence.","Positive"
"We had such a great time!! The magic is really in the air and being there for the Christmas decorations was so beautiful, especially at night. We had a 2 day park hopper pass and on the first day got there when it opened. We must have been extremely lucky the whole day because we didn't wait in line for a ride for more than 15 minutes!! Take water and some snacks, it's better to have something then keep buying what the park offers all day. On the second day it was raining a lot so we went to Downtown Disney and saw a movie at the AMC and when we came out the sun was shining for the rest of the day!! Both nights were cold and windy so rug up!Side note: if you plan on going on rides with water, take off jumpers sweaters so you have something warm to put on after and take spare socks and underwear   this is a lifesaver!!","Positive"
"Having been to Disneyworld the previous year, Disneyland Paris was very similar, but on a smaller scale. Same rides, same long lines, same crap food, only this time with lots of smokers, and a few crazy French rules. It is Disney and the kids had fun, but I don't think it was worth missing a day in Paris for.","Neutral"
"Excellent as always, my son is 18 and it was just like we were all relieving our childhood. Much more friendlier than Orlando","Positive"
"If your to go one place in your life you must bring the kids to Disney. It's a magical holiday for both Parents and children equally. The adults get transported back to their childhood and have just as much fun if not more then the kids. It's just a magical dream holiday for all ages. We travelled with three generations and all enjoyed it as much as the next person. ","Positive"
"Friendly characters, fun stores and great rides for all ages! Disneyland was the best experience that my family and I have ever had. We will be back again and again!","Positive"
"Take a look at the online pricing and judge for yourself. The park is as beautiful as ever but the ticket prices are stratospheric. And once inside the parks the food is at least a couple bucks more per item than you would pay at any restaurant somewhere else. ","Positive"
"What's not to love?  Fun tip: Splash Mountain is practically deserted after 6p...practically walk right onto the ride.","Positive"
"It's hard to compare HK's Disneyland to California, but it is pretty nice for families and a good value. I went on a rainy day, so the park was completely empty. The staff were really friendly, although a little bored. When I have kids I will bring them here if we are in HKG!","Neutral"
"HK disney is boring  go ocean park  go la disney  but dont go hk disney","Negative"
"Having been to the Disney properties in Orlando, Paris and Tokyo, it was kind of fun to visit the original. They have updated their attractions to include Star Wars and Finding Nemo themed rides. Still the place is showing its 60 years age. It is not nearly as spotlessly clean as other venues as I recall. And there are construction barriers all over the park, especially Main Street. The railroad train that circles the park stalled for hours.","Negative"
"Yes 10 days. This is our second time. We tend to go over the busy new year break. The place has a huge buzz. Then it gets quiet so you can go on the rides easily. It you just cruise around the park and take it all in not rushed it is a relaxing experience in a place that everyone is happy to be there ","Positive"
"We love Disney. For one day, we buy into the dream, the gimmicks, the fun. We've been to both Disney parks in the US and others internationally. This summer, we got to add Disney Paris to the list. We had high expectations based on our other experiences. Ultimately, we had a lovely day, so I can't be too hard on Disney Paris. We loved the castle!! BUT, there were two main problems that we had that really could be fixed. First, the majority of rides were either down all day or not functioning for large parts of the day. Fast pass was useless. We spent a lot of time walking from ride to ride only to find they were closed. Or, worse yet, we'd be standing in long queues for a ride and it would shut down. Second, the staff need to smile, make eye contact, and otherwise appear to like their job. I mean, really, it's Disney!! Many of the ride food staff just looked irritated and distracted. For this reason, I am glad Disney Paris was not our first Disney experience, or we'd be totally turned off. The one exception, was a most enjoyable young man working at the Tower of Terror. The ride had technical difficulty (see above problem) while we were in line and he made an effort to make it fun for everyone. At the end of the day, we approached customer service and reported our experience to them. To their credit, they offered us free tickets to return on another day. The tickets, however, could only be used at Disney Paris which was not an option for us. So, they gave my daughter a small stuffed animal instead. I hope that they listen to feedback and at least try to make some improvements. Smiles are free!","Negative"
"I went this summer with my daughter and we were there because we wanted to experience our second childhood again. Just to be on the tube with all the reminder on the Disney character was enough to put us in the mood for more! I will not talk about the price because to me, if you wanted to be in this kind of place, you will have to expect this kind of price.We were like little kids, no holds bar if you really wanted to enjoy yourself. After all, you have paid your entrance fee, why not make the most of it. Are all Disneylands alike, yes and no. There are of course subtle differences like it or not. So enjoy the little differences that you will find. Hong Kong Disneyland is small but it's still enjoyable. if you are visiting in summer like me, make sure you bring an umbrella, it's hot! Make sure you are well hydrated because you get caught up in the excitement and before you know it, you just might end up with sun stroke. A cap is also recommended. Be prepared for the long wait for shows. It can be stiffling in the heat but everybody puts this up with good humour especially parents with young kids.If you want to see the fireworks before the park closes, it is probably better to be there around noon onwards. That way, you and your kids will not be so tired that by the time you get to watch the fireworks, you are just too tired to enjoy it. We decided to actually have our dinner there and I must say the food is actually good and delicious. I stopped looking at prices and that helps.The firework was really good. We got ourselves a good spot to watch the display. It is also easy to get back to Hong Kong Tsim Sha Tsui even with all the people catching the train. Way to go. Will want to visit again when I am back in Hong Kong!","Positive"
"Disneyland Park is by far the best theme park I've ever been to. It has something for everyone and can capture a sense of magic no matter your age, gender or belief. Despite always being packed I love the ticketed fast pass system and over 3 5 days you can just relax and really enjoy the park with everything it has on offer. You really need to spend the time to appreciate everything in the park and not just rush it. You will miss things if you don't really take the time to walk around, check out everything really make note of every little detail.","Positive"
"The park is far too small for the amount of people that are entering. There are long wait times and queues for everything. Security is a joke   they don't actually tell you anywhere what you aren't allowed to take in which means that nobody knows and this creates a huge queue with people asking why they can't enter with things and arguing about where they can leave things to collect them on the return. The queue management for everything is just a disaster from buying tickets, queuing to get in and out of the park and buying food   it's slow and badly organised and if you go in the summer most of the time you are waiting outside in 30 degree heat. No ideal at all. There aren't many rides and you can probably do every single ride in the park in half a day if there were no queues. There was always a queue for the toilet and they were not kept very clean at all. Food and drink is expensive so I would recommend that you took your own   make sure your drinks are in a plastic bottle. The metro station is about a 5 minute walk from the park and be warned that at the end of the day you will have to wait a long time in complete chaos just to get into the metro station. Not sure why Disney doesn't offer a bus service to the park entrance from the metro station and the buses that take you to the hotels. Buses to hotels were also a complete disaster. You have to wait again in a long queue and the bus stops at the Disney World hotel first and then moves on to the Hollywood Hotel. Not sure why they can't have separate buses as it just makes the journey so much longer. Park was a big disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Hong Kong has another theme park which is called Ocean Park. It's much better than Disney, better value for money and better organised. Would not return here and would not recommend to anyone.","Negative"
"Small park, just didn   t feel like Disney, lion king show was cancelled to park attendees as they booked a private part all day, unfair I thought, some restaurants were closed, the castle was a building site, very poor considering we still payed full price, mentioned to Disney customer services but was brushed off with reply that I should have checked web site day before for closures! Bit crap when I bought the ticket 2 months earlier, I   d not be returning, really poor excuse for a Disneyland!","Neutral"
"This park opened in 1955, it was not designed to hold 80,000 people. It is out of date with old rides that constantly break down. We needed 3 attempts to ride the most modern of these, the Indiana Jones ride, because it kept having  technical issues .Many of the attractions were closed for one reason or another. You won't find this out until it's too late. For example,  its a small world  is closed for 2 weeks to get it ready for christmas??? couldn't they have waited until after the busy halloween breaks?The magic hour is a complete waste of time. They let you in an hour earlier than the general public but then only open 2 sections of the park. The queue for the Peter Pan ride was bigger than I've ever seen it for this reason. There are no longer disney characters strolling around the parks either. If they do make a fleeting appearance you will have to queue to have a photo taken and then they will be whisked away.Some areas are just too narrow to cater for the crowds and we were there off peak. In particular the narrow streets around frontier land became particularly congested.Disney California Adventure Park across the way is far superior in every way to this dilapidated old relic from the 50's. The rides and layout are good examples of a more modern architecture.I certainly won't be rushing back","Neutral"
"Can do in a day... But with a 5 year old, take 2 days and enjoy.  Beautiful like all Disney parks and friendly staff.  Everything from parade to fireworks is on a smaller scale, but still lovely!","Positive"
"Make sure you are well rested and have good shoes on as you need them, if you are short on time I would suggest getting in as early as possible and getting straight into it. There is so much to see and do and so, we did it in 3 days (2 adults) but that was 8am   10pm so huge days, you will be exhausted but it is well worth it. If you have kids you will need to say about a week to go through it all they will not handle all the walking etc. But you have to do both parks, the new one is a lot better with rides etc but the old one is from when you are a kid, have to do both","Positive"
"It was magical, lots of rides for all the family and all the characters just made us all kids again.","Positive"
"Myself and my partner have dreamt for years of coming to Disneyland Paris together for Halloween. We are a young hard working couple and saved for over a year to be able to afford our dream trip. We booked the full Disney package in August 2018 (flights, magical shuttle, hotel, park tickets and full board dining plan) and couldn't wait to arrive for Halloween week.The problems started the second we landed at Paris CDG Airport when our not so  magical shuttle  bus was no where to be found. After waiting an hour outside the airport at the shuttle stop, we decided to ring the hotel (Disney Santa Fe) to find out where it was. It was only at this point we were informed that the shuttle stopped at 8pm (which makes me think why did they allow us to book and pay for this, knowing our flight arrived after this time). The hotel assured us they would fully refund our taxi when we arrived   which cost 64euros. Turns out we had to file for a refund request which can take 15 working days to get a response from. As we were on the full board dining plan, we only brought 80euros with us as extra spends for shops etc. This therefore left us with 16euros for the next 4 days.It was 10pm when we arrived at our hotel. Luckily the canteen was open until 10.30pm, so we were able to pop in for a bite to eat with our dining plan. When checking in, we were told all blocks had coffee and vending machines, however once we got to our room, they were all 'out of order', and remained that way for the entire stay.On our first morning we decided to visit the Disneyland Parc, all in all we had a fairly enjoyable day. However the hyperinflation of guests was unbareable to say the least. Queue times were ridiculous, with some being up to 90 minutes long for a 2 minute ride. Throughout the day me and my partner ate exactly the same meal until the evening when we ate at the Hukuna Matata restaurant. I had the meatballs, and he had chicken strips. All seemed fine at the time until the next morning when he became incredibly ill, from what seems to be minor food poisoning. This set us back for our entire 2nd day (Halloween).In the evening of Halloween, my parter decided some fresh air might do him some good, so we headed down to the Disneyland Parc to try and enjoy the halloween party   the one thing we came to experience. Once we got to the gates we showed our Magic Pass, only to be DENIED ACCESS! Not once were we informed that this was an additional expense and we could not enter the park without a prepaid wristband. We were then forced to spend the entire evening sat in our hotel room.We can't comment on the price of food as we were full board, however we have seen many families have to pay out over 80euros for a few sandwiches and drinks.We haven't had any issues with the staff, and were actually susprised at how accomodating they are to English guests. We are writing this whilst sat in the hotel room on our 3rd day. We did go into the Disneyland Parc this morning however we just had to leave due to the amount of people they had managed to cram in through the gates. There was no chance of getting on any ride without having to queue for over an hour in the rain. We even had to queue to leave the park!All in all it feels that the individual is not valued in Disney anymore. It just seems to be about getting as many people in and making as much money as possible. I think old Walt Disney himself would be looking down in dissapointment.Looking forward to going home tomorrow!","Negative"
"We were at Disney Paris on 12 21 2016. Crowded as expected just before Christmas. Men were employed, mopping the bathroom floors in the women's restrooms throughout both parks  while women were using the restrooms. I caught one  peering  through the cracks of the stalls in use. I reported this incident to one employee who did not take me seriously; I then reported this to three employees at the gate who took a description. I also emailed a complaint to Disney Paris via their website  awaiting a response.Separately, wait times are inaccurate. Hotel guests are issued vouchers to fast pass any ride any time, throwing off crowd control measures from regular fast passes. Employees allow fast pass holders to advance in line without any stoppage  unlike at CA or FL where there is a minor wait time as patrons are pulled from both lines. Expect to wait double the time.","Negative"
"It's my 4th. visit to disneyland paris and all the times I had rain.A point to improve is languaje handling. If your kids don't speak english or french then some shows losse great part of the interest. This is specially notorious in the disney studios park, where in most of the shows someone is telling you a story in english or french. At most you get subtitles in other languajes, but my 8 and 5 years old kids can't read so fast.A bad point was breakfast in newport hotel where for 2 days we had incredible long queues. the 3rd and 4th they finally reacted and set up a second room for breakfast.An advice: 2 days in working days are worth 4 days in week end, So go to the park during the week and visit Paris on the week end.","Neutral"
"Having been to Disneyland in both Orlando and Hong Kong, you know what to expect with Disney parks and Paris is by no means any different, yes it's magical, yes the staff are amazing but do check what time of year you go. We visited on the 27th and 28th of December and I've never witnessed crowds like it imagine 100,000 football fans squeezing into a 25,000 seater stadium it was chaos.Before going I read a lot of reviews and listened to a lot of people moan about que pushing, price and fag smoking. All of which is true but not half as bad as what people make out it to be.A hot dog was around   5A hot chocolate   1.80Two drinks   5It's what you expect from a park!Que pushing will happen if you let it and people smoke it's Europe.I'm honestly gutted I went when I did as it's nice to visit a Disney park with time to stroll, it enables you to take everything in an enjoy the experience. If you feel the same avoid peak season","Neutral"
"Firstly they have some great rides, really enjoyed the big rides in both parks and some of the shows. Food and refreshments are very expensive probably made worse by the poor GBP Euro exchange rate. Some of the rides seemed to be out of order quite a lot especially Thunder Mountain, on our last day the ride was running with a wait of 45 minutes on a disabled pass and on one day the wait was over 4 hours on a Fast Pass. Some of the areas look a bit tired with paving breaking up, just not the same attention to detail as the US park. Also the cast are just not as enthusiastic as the ones in the US   the one exception is the crew on the Tower of Terror who were hilarious. My biggest gripe was going to the park for the two extra hours that you gain as a guest of the Disney hotels. Firstly the Studio park wasn't opened until the usual 10am and most of the rides in the main park were closed   a real con. Could the park let the hotels know so they can post information before you go over for an early start? All said, we did have a good time but not as magical as I remembered.","Neutral"
"Disneyland has always been overpriced but it's fun, I suppose. If we didn't have kids I probably would never go back because it's such a huge waste of money. The kids who work the rides are friendly for the most part and the food is mediocre. It was insanely crowded the last week of January. I can only guess that was because of the unseasonably hot weather. All in all, overcrowded no matter what time of year, overpriced for what you get, and the food is overpriced and underwhelming.","Negative"
"This was not a place where dreams come true.  How being in a queue for 45 minutes with young children equates to happy time?  Yes there is the fast queue tickets you can buy, but regardless there must be a better way to manage those...More","Negative"
"Having been to Disneyworld Orlando four time with my children many years ago that experience gave me a lifetime of memories. This year in May 2015 I decided with my wife to take my granddaughter to Disneyland Paris. I went for six days, five nights and paid for the premium food package on full board basis. I stayed at the New York hotel within the resort. The hotel was Ok but expected more for a four star hotel. I had an early flight unfortunately and arrived at the resort at 1020 am . I was told on check in that the room was not ready till 3 pm. Not good when you have a four year old who has been up and travelling since 4am. In most hotels in Europe rooms are usually available at mid day. I noticed that the tiles in the bathroom were cracked along the bottom by the floor and the beds were like sleeping on wooden pallets. The Disney parks were a let down, seven of the rides in both parks were broken (this you are not told before you book or arrive at location) The park was somewhat dirty and even though you saw cleaning staff around they were more interested in walking in three's and fours,talking,smoking and basically not doing what they were paid to do. The plants and shrubs and supposedly manicured areas were un kept. The buildings of the rides looked tired with worn out paint. The majority of staff were polite but I found that on some of the rides for children like the Rocket, Dumbo, mad hatters rides the more the queue's the less time you had to ride . It appeared that because of the queues one or two of the rides lasted only 1min 10sec.This park is very different to the USA parks, This park is very small and you can get round comfortably in about 2 and a half days. We queued for some 2hours forty minutes to get a picture and signature from one of the princesses. It was almost that for the other characters.You had to queue at 1030 in the morn to get a ticket for the princess pavilion but were then told your child could only see one and not any of the the others. The queues for other rides were deceptive it would say 5 mins when it fact it was 40 minutes when you passed the gate. How do you tell a child they cant go on it. Thank god she was an angel throughout the whole trip and we queued where necessary. People may say I'm just complaining but when you go to the US parks you kind of expect DISNEY to provide at least the same or similar don't you?. I must mention the meal plans. These are cruelly deceptive. I went for a full board premium plan and was told I could eat what I wanted from the menu and in any restaurant within the Disney resort I wanted. Not if you don't have a reservation!!!!!!! How can you reserve for a four year old. The premium plan allows you to choose from the al acarte menu but in some of the restaurants they have the premium plan menu, two starters, three main and three deserts to choose from wow!! All this for 125 euro ( $160) per meal for three. A meal for three could cost you as much as $200 plus If you don't buy the meal plans. There are other lower plans but the food is just as bad. Didn't know my child would be restricted to froi gras or smoked salmon. I expected far more choice for what I paid. This they don't tell you when you book your holiday!!!! I was told that the premier restaurants was the California grill in the Disneyland hotel . Two things to say about that, bad, cold food, very poor service. The character meals they sell, you expect to see a lot of them there we saw four character at one meal and three princesses at another and we had to wait over an hour to see the first princess and drank water waiting for the others as we had already eaten our meal. When I got fed up with the rubbish food I went to a deli who stated that she would not take my voucher for a cheese and ham sandwich. Eventually a manage from Walts restaurant kindly helped us out an the voucher was accepted. We ate at the Lucky nugget, they took our vouchers and explained that we would lose money by eating there we understood but had a great burger. I will say go the the Buffalo Bill dinner show that was the best!!!The trip overall was disappointing considering the cost we paid. In hindsight I would have taken her to the USA for that little extra. Don't get the premium plans there not worth it.!!!!! All in all my grand daughter had a great time and we made it as best we could but I will not go back there and would advise others to think about it before going to DISNEYLAND PARIS. I think finally that the CEO's of Disney need to get out there and sort this out. I'd have sacked a few of those bosses by now!!! Rant over","Negative"
"Quite a entertaining place even just as a couple. We had loads of fun. I would say it's an absolute must to see when in HK.","Positive"
"We love the Disneyland Resort. We used to go annually for about 10 years in a row but have not gone for 3 so it was a real treat, even with the crowds and long lines. We love the fact that once you enter the park, the only things you have to worry about are getting on the rides, timing your fast passes, and eating   all your cares are left behind! The only thing that I did not realize is that not all the characters are there every day (or even every other day) and the staff either aren't supposed to tell you or will not tell you what days and times those characters will be at the park. We liked the changes at Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.","Positive"
"We visited Disney Paris April 11 15 with our two little girls who are 3 and 5. We were a litte disappointed and so were our girls who really wanted to see the princesses. They were no where to be found. We saw every other character in the parades, character dinners etc.., but not a princess to be found until our last day we saw Snow White and Sleeping Beauty over by  Small World   ride. We had to wait in really long lines to see them both. I even asked at our hotel  The Disneyland Hotel  and they could not tell me where to find them. They just shook their head saying they have no idea what characters will be where. I could not believe my ears. Were we really at  Disney ???? I had to tell my kids that the princess were on a little vacation this week. It was heart breaking, truely. There was a castle and a whole  Princess Stage  area next to the castle, but no performances. I just could not believe it. I am sure my girls were not the only ones disappointed. Our weather was perfect during our entire stay which I think made the park even more busy than usual. The lines were unreasonably long for my two kids and so was the garbage everywhere. They bathrooms were even worse. I could not believe how many garbage cans were overflowing with garbage. And the bathrooms were so dirty and smelly I completely walked out of one and ran back to our hotel room just to use the toilet. I had a friend that visited in early March during a time the weather wasn't so nice and it was still very crowded and she also said the same thing that the garbage cans were overflowing every where and the bathrooms were just horrible.As for our hotel  The Disneyland Hotel, my husband and I were disappointed in the quality of the hotel. Yes, the location was perfect! The pool was not that great for young kids who are learning how to swim. Our room was really in need of updating ie...the bathroom, capet, linens. Personally we stayed at the Holiday Inn outside the park one night, and I thought it was nicer due to the updated bathroom etc... It was just newer all around. As for the food, well it was no doubt expensive. We enjoyed all of our dinner experiences at the hotel buffet  Inventions , Chef Mickey was outstanding food, but again all really expensive. I felt our lunchtie meals were more limited to  unhealty foods or fast foods . It would have been nice to have healthier selections. Our kids enjoyed the food as well.To be fair, I will say that we did enjoy our trip, but for the money we spent we expected much better quality  Disney Quality . We were at Walt Disney World last year around this same time and we had none of the same problems or experiences. We are not sure if we would recommend doing this trip if you have not been to  The Walt Disney World  nothing really compares to it. I would really like to return but can't see spending that kind of money for such poor quality of services.. Sorry Disneyland Paris.","Negative"
"I love Disneyland. So does my Autistic daughter. Disneyland has changed their handicap policy, because of evil people who abused it. Now you need to go to a kiosk and request a ride. They scan your ticket and tell you when to show up at that attraction. Wait times can be as long as an hour. In the meantime, you cannot ride any other rides as your ticket is locked into the one you requested. If you stand in the line you can, but if you are in a wheelchair or a scooter and try to access handicap line they tell you that you have to wait until your first ride is finished..so for that hour, you are pretty much sitting there waiting. One day at Disneyland and we were able to ride 4 rides. The second day we hired a V.I.P for $400.00 an hour. Yep, you heard me right. $400.00 an hour. And you have to have a minimum of 6 hours. $2400.00 for my family to be able to ride more than 4 rides. Two of the rides we went on were 45 minute waits even with the VIP guide. And both of those rides closed down just as we we getting to the front of the line. Two hours wasted. We were refunded one hour, so at least we weren't that upset. I don't advise a VIP guide, as nothing about it made my family feel Very Important. No bottle of water, munchies or even straight to the front of the line. In fact..WE bought our guide lunch. So..sorry Disneyland. This family that has come every year for the last 20 years, will NO longer be patrons. Until you change your handicap policy, for the better and not for the worse, my money will be spent elsewhere. You might have shut down the scammers, but you made it impossible for those that truly need the handicap services to enjoy your park.","Negative"
"I remember the place more for the company i was with. Despite the rainy weather we had a fun time. Compared to the other Disney resorts i have visited this was ok. As it is still new i am sure they will improv and make it a more interesting place. The place has potential. Highlight was that you can find many eating places, chinese, halal, malaysian, indian etc. Reasonably priced. Entrance tickets were expensive considering there were not as many rides and entertainment. Due to the rainy weather we did not see the full parade. Public Transport to and from Disneyland is very easy and cheap. Is alright if you want a kids day out.","Neutral"
"We were here with my daughter and granddaughter. What can you say... It's Disneyland. Lots of walking, very very, VERY expensive. And so very crowded. But still fun to see her light up with excitement.","Positive"
"After going to Disneyworld several time in the last 15 years, Disneyland was a little bit of a let down. The rides were fun, and it was neat to see the differences between Disneyland and Disneyworld's Magic Kingdom. The best rides are the ones that aren't duplicated in other places. One difference is that the lines at Disneyland don't move as fast as the ones in Disneyworld (looks like for several rides Disneyland was the first ... or prototype and they made it better at Disneyworld). It was also crowded ... even on off season days.","Neutral"
"We were really excited to go to Disneyland on our first trip to LA. Unfortunately, it just didn't live up to the hype in our eyes. Everything was nice, food was reasonably priced for the world's most famous Park but unless you have children who are at the enjoying Disney age, it may not be the best destination. We also went to Universal Studios on our trip and rated it far higher that Disneyland   it just had more things that could be enjoyed by adults as well as children. We still sis the tea cup ride though   how couldn't you!","Neutral"
"My daughter and her friend visited earlier this year and as they are both 16 they were looking forward to trying out the more challenging rides. However, to their disappointment, only Hyperspace Mountain was open, as the Big Grizzly Mountain runaway cars was closed. Whilst I do accept that maintenance is required this was on a very busy Saturday in July so it was rather annoying to pay over   50 for a ticket and not be able to experience the bigger rides. As a result they came out of the park earlier than planned as the queues for the other rides were very long. There needs to be more of the big rides to balance out the queues for the younger ages rides.","Neutral"
"I am not a Disney person, but I have to admit I am converted. the Shows were awesome and the fireworks at the end of the day were most amazing. The Parades are Great and the shows are good....Good Food as well and entry is very reasonable. Easy to get a taxi to and back from the venue....","Positive"
"We went here on my birthday honeymoon and out of everywhere I visited in Hong Kong this was the worst experience. I absolutely hated it and it spoilt the Disney illusion. The mickey mouse train to and from was the best part of this experience.If visiting be prepared to be pushed out the way and people to queue jump and dirty looks when you won't let people past or you tell them there is a queue. There is no such thing as personal space either. Whilst in the queue the people behind were that close you could feel the spit on your back as they were talking.Save your money and visit ocean park!!","Negative"
"DLP pales in comparison to WDW and DL in the USA. The Paris version is dirtier (especially the bathrooms which had ridiculous lines) and less organized. Disney is known for their touches but the adults noticed deficiencies in Paris. We could hardly believe how many people were smoking without being asked to move to smoking areas. Queue cutting was also rampant with many people holding spots for others. The scanning Fastpass system doesn't work very well at DLP with most visitors requiring help from cast members to use their ticket to receive a FP. Unfortunately there are very long queues at the other rides and many lack the usual Disney touches to help pass the time. If you go, go on the rides that are unique to DLP: Ratatouille, Space Mountain 2, Nautilus, Dragon's Liar, Crush's Coaster, etc. and buy your ticket at FNAC as they sell reduced price tickets. Pirates of the Caribbean was also a great ride despite not being unique to DLP. Rock 'n' Roller Coaster was a let down as the music was not working and this was not announced or even acknowledged until after we finished the ride and asked about the lack of it. Arrmageddon was not worth the invested time (pre show seemed longer than the effects show).Some DLP areas and restaurants closed before the park and while hours were posted, the information was at the location itself so one would walk all the way to it to find it closed (huge areas of Fantasyland!) The parade surprisingly played the same song over and over rather than having coordinated music as it travelled along the route. We heard great things about Cinemagique and Disney Dreams (fireworks etc.) but we missed both. The last Cinemagique show of the day was cancelled and Disney Dreams didn't start until 23:00 which would have made the day too long to then ride the RER (for an hour) back to Paris proper.I must say our kids loved the day at DLP because they love Disney but really it could be (and should have been) better because it has the Disney name and is expensive.","Neutral"

"I've been an annual pass holder for years and every year I debate to renew or not. I go less and less each year, they're so crowded now and the quality of everything is suffering . Even the crowd now is so different, so ghetto...smelly, rude, women changing kids diapers outside the bathrooms, kids stepping all over plants, trash. It's horrendous . Not what I used to be. Not sure how these people can afford the passes with all those kids but they won't go away anytime soon. Disneyland is still pretty but little by little it's turning into an ugly street fair .","Neutral"

"Okay, I get the strollers. But since when did the electric scooters become vogue? I certainly understand them for those who are handicapped, but believe me the vast majority just used them to get around in because they were too lazy or too large to walk. Plus there are now so many parades throughout the day that there is always added congestion due to one way traffic and roped off traffic lanes. Go from 07:00 10:00am and 9:00 12:00pm. Stay away the rest of the time. We wont be going back.","Neutral"

"For adults this park is so overpriced. While you're still able to go on all the rides, there are only 5 thrill rides that you would really want to go on as an adult. 1 wasn't even opened when I went there and 1 of them (Stat Wars Spaceship) was a simulation thy I wouldn't recommend.Of course it is used for kids but they do advertise its just not for kids, well...Still it's a Disney Land Park and it's still stunning to be in!","Neutral"
"This is a hard review for me to write since I have been to Disneyland countless times over the years with my daughter (who is now 11). I have a lot of respect and admiration for the creators, artists, and innovators of Disney movies and attractions. These men and women are truly inspiring. Walt would be proud. Who I don't have a lot of respect for are the greedy corporate shills that have taken Walt's vision for Disneyland and tossed it out the window in the name of profit maximization. It's pretty ridiculous, and last weekend's trip to Disneyland will be my last. Here are a few cold, hard truths about Disneyland:1) Way too crowded all day everyday. There is no off season.2) Ridiculously long waits for rides (because it is too crowded)3) Fast pass system inefficient (because it is too crowded)4) Obscenely expensive everything (all goods made in china cheap quality)5) Terrible food (minimal healthy choices stupid expensive)6) Terrible value for the amount of $$$ spent (you pay to stand in line)7) People are herded around like human cattle (it's disheartening to watch)8) There are lines for everything (and I mean everything)Overall, I can't imagine why any would want to drop hundreds, and even thousands of $$$ to essentially stand in line all day for a few minutes of fun. It just doesn't seem worth it. The only ones benefiting from this system are the suits. That is it.","Negative"
"Was quite disappointed with the park and should have done some research. We were mostly disappointed about the small size of the park and lack of rides compared to its North American and even EuroDisney counterparts. It's quite far from HK but easy to get to by MTR although you will need to transfer a couple of time. It doesn't need more than 1 day to get through it. We bought 2 day tickets but actually did not regret it as the heat in August is oppressive and we could only stay for a few hours at a time. Favourite rides were the Grizzly Gulch train and Mystic Manor (as it was air conditioned). Hyperspace mountain was OK   Star Wars themed now but pretty tame coaster compared to the updated Space Mountains in other parks. Meet and greet with the Star Wars characters was also a highlight though. On the 2nd day, it rained a little and all the outdoor rides closed. Also all the food vendors shut down as well. Can't imagine what we would have done if we bought the food voucher. If you've been to other Disney parks, prepare to be disappointed. If this is your first time to Disney, you get a taste of what the original is like so you will likely have much more fun.","Negative"
"I expected more... my idea was kind of Florida's Disneyland.. it is still good   nice crowdy atmosphere... but... very much for kids, probably best for families that really want to impress their 4 to 8 years old kids... most attractions are mainly for young kids... Not for teenage fun... in my opinion!","Neutral"
"We travelled in Feb 2014, and from all the times we have been, Feb was the best!Small lines, minimal crowds (larger crowds over Presidents Day Weekend).Wednesday seemed to be the quietest day during our trip.Food prices were excellent   family of 5 for approx $50 per meal (a little dearer at higher end restaurants).A magical experience for us as always! Cast members were all very polite and helpful.The new photo pass idea is brilliant. You get your photo with a character, or at specific points around the park taken by a photographer   they scan a card and give it to you. Your photos are then able to be digitally downloaded once you get home, or you can order a disk with all photos from your stay. We purchased the Photo pass plus card (approx $100) which represents great value, considering the dining with characters photos are $34.95 each! All our character photos, dining photos and ride photos were uploaded to our photo pass and I easily logged on and got our disk shipped to Australia. Our kids did the Bibbity Bobbity boutique experience and loved it! Expensive for the top package for girls ($200)but only $15 each for my boys! (Perhaps a larger package for the boys would be an option also?) very busy in the boutique the day we had our appointment and we had a 1 hr wait, but we were offered a fast pass for any ride in either Disneyland or the California Adventure park for our entire party of 7 as apologies for the delay!Overall we had a wonderful trip and are already planning our next!","Positive"

"If you are going to Disneyland stay away from grad night . The park was at capacity and the grads were very rude of guests who paid full admission for the day into the park as well. Line jumping , yelling , drinking in line . It was out of control. Would not recommend this park in the week of may that has the grad night . We wasted 100.00 each for this day into the park .","Negative"
"The rides and everything is newer than Anaheim, but the park is a lot smaller. Everything is done to a smaller scale including the costumes and parade. Make sure you do everything in Paris first before going here.We are in Paris for a month and did everything already so decided to go there. The grilled meat bbq restaurant in Frontierland is bad so do not go their. They look like they boil their chicken and do not even freshly grill their ribs. Took us over 1.5 hour to get out of there.Buzz lightyear ride was sad with just red laserpointers, not as cool as the one in Anaheim.","Neutral"
"What do you expect? It is Disneyland. It is small compare to its north America counterpart. Quiet crowded I would say. Especially when you come in some Chinese public holiday like may first or the national day. Usually a long queue for rides unless you choose ur visit day wisely. Weekdays are better and go early or better late must package tour leave before 1600. I go there because I have a kid of 32 months and my wife like Disney character. It is not bad a place to relax and have a little bit of fun when it is not crowded. But why read the review? You will go anyway if you have planned to go. You won't go if Disney is not your cup of tea. My point is you got what you ask for. But not much more.","Negative"
"This is my third visit to Disneyland, and my first as an adult. Everything is as I remember from 20 years ago and I mean that in a good sense. Everything is perfectly clean and well taken care of. The staff is friendly and helps create this magical atmosphere. We visited on February on a Sunday, the park was crowded though strangely we didn't wait as much as I remember from other visits. Our longest wait was  Pirates of the Caribbean , we were over half an hour on the line or so. Still a great ride, maybe could use a bit more falls but great still.  Star tours  is nice though nothing out of the ordinary, I got a little dizzy halfway through so that is one thing to consider, if you get dizzy easily like me you might not enjoy this ride as much. Had the opportunity to see  Asimo  the Honda Robot perform, this I would only recommend if you have a fascination for technology or robots. It lasts 15 minutes and it is setup with an actor that simulates the experience of having received a robot at his house in the near future, shows basically what you can see in a Youtube video about Asimo, walking, running, stairs, dancing and such. Very good experience for technophiles. One ride I wouldn't recommend is the Nemo Submarine, it was boring. Maybe a kid would find it a little more exciting, but as an adult there is not much to see. You are half submerged in an uncomfortable subumarine and look through the circular windows parts of the story of  Finding Nemo . It really is not an immersive experience (no pun intended), I guess it's one of those things that looked good on paper but in reality is a boring ride. Would not recommend skip it.One thing that I would recommend was  Phantasmic , the show at night in which Mickey mouse fights the forces of evil right in front of the Cinderella castle by the lake. It's a good show and has good moments. Though you have to have a Flash pass to see it well, as the staff won't let you get closer to the lake unless you have one. I had to see it from far away. This arrangement seems strange and unnecessary, I mean you are right there standing behind a rope with all this open space in front of you not used just because you don't have a Flash pass. It's absurd, I think it's an stupid idea to not let all the parkgoers see the show, it's right there in the middle of the park but they let you see it uncomfortably standing behind a rope feeling like a second class citizen. What is the point? You already have paid a ticket to be in the park. This is the only one thing that was bad about the park, I almost feel like taking away a point from a 5 star rating of the park though I don't do it because the rest is very good.The rides I would recommend for first time park goers as a must are:  Pirates of the Caribbean  It's a small world (it's a simple attraction but still very iconic)  Haunted House (though the day I went it was closed..)  Splash Mountain (also closed right now, but for the season)  Star tours (if you don't get dizzy)  Space mountain (if you like rollercoasters)The other one thing that I would complain is the parking, it's confusing if you arrive in a car as the signals are a poor help. Besides most of the time you don't even park in the park itself, they redirect you to nearby hotels where a shuttle takes you to the actual park (the rate was 17 dollars for the whole day if I remember correctly). While everything is well coordinated it's not very nice to have to waste an extra 20 30 minutes in the parking lot and shuttle. Overall great experience. Be ready to walk though, as there's a lot to see and most of the time you have to walk everywhere. The monorail doesn't help at all since it's just a way to get in and out of the park, it really helps nothing in getting around the park.","Positive"
"Please save your money and go somewhere else!! It is full of ignorant people who do not know how to queue. Some of the people would literally stand on your kids to get to the front to see anything that is happening. There is no communication on the park to inform you of what is happening. If your child wants to meet Mickey Mouse you have to pay extra money on top of what you have already paid to get into the park in a restaurant. The rides are not always open (even when weather good) you queue for over an hour for a 30 second ride (no exaggeration). The toilets are disgusting. I am not a moaner but honestly this holiday has been the worst we have ever been on my kids (13 & 6) wanted to go home after 2 days so that must say something.","Negative"
"Do not even attempt to go to Disneyland hk during summer. The crowd started in the train to Disneyland from Sunny Bay station. When you enter the park, all you can see is a sea of Chinese tourists. I think Disneyland never bother to limit the number of visitors into the park. Queues for rides are an hour or more under the hot sun. People are standing so close in a queue to each other that you can practically feel each other's breath. Eateries were packed with people and you have to even queue up to use the toilets! We only managed to get only one ride in the 'small small world' because we had to think about our three year old's welfare. We do not want him to fall sick during the trip. We totally enjoyed our hk trip except for the Disneyland. It's a total waste of money. My advice to parents with young kids: skip Disneyland hk totally if you care about your kids! My advice to Disneyland management: if you do not limit the number of visitors into the park, I am sure nobody will want to return to your park a second time.","Negative"
"Disneyland should be better than it is   very disappointed with our visit, which for us was a once in a lifetime event. Its not everyday you travel from Australia to go to Disneyland! The crowds were unbelievable   people, people everywhere, huge queues at every ride. I have never seen such a huge concentration of prams and wheelchairs in one place before. The parades performances were great, what we could see   people take up pole position 1 2 hrs before the event. Staff were average, looked bored and apathetic, its definitely not a magical place. My suggestion is that numbers entering the park should be capped to ensure that people have an enjoyable time . Of course this wouldn't happen because I get the feeling that it is all about money at the expense of people's enjoyment.","Negative"
"Disneyland is the best. I am an old grump and even I can't deny the magic. The attention to theme and detail is unsurpassed.","Positive"

"I have been to Disneyland, about 7 times. I am 35 years old. I recently took my kids in 2014, and had not been in 20 years. The prices per ticket is absolutely outrageous! The adults cost just as much as the kids! They don't realize that us adults will not be riding all of the rides? Without us adults, there is no kids at Disneyland. We along with our kids should be half the price of what they charge. Tickets should be below $50. They make so much money every day, and they feel the need to charge $100  a ticket? What planet are they on? We went in April during school, during the week, and it was still crazy busy! I can't imagine a weekend, or summer, or a major holiday. They say they raise prices to keep people from coming? Really, well it isn't working. They need to limit the capacity by the thousands!! So people can enjoy themselves, not stand in lines for HOURS! We were there 10  hours, and found ourselves chasing the clock. It will never change, it will get worse by the day, and has been bad for decades. The sad thing is, its become about the money, not about the kids, or the park. What would Walt Disney say? I wish more people didn't go, but if you want to, you will spend a fortune. The other thing is, the majority of us are traveling from afar, and spend a fortune just to get there, but local residents get discount? Really? You know, so anyway, yes fun place, but too many people. Universal was just as busy, but at least a little cheaper.","Negative"
"great for all ages, we went on every single attraction and couldn't fault any off them. With some of the more popular rides i would recommend getting a fast pass ticket at no extra cost and then return between your allocated times for less of a queue.Only downfall is the queues to meet the characters for the sake of a two second photo! but obviously that has to be expected at Disney : )","Positive"

"Do NOT come to Disney on a busy weekend, like Halloween, if you have physical challenges. When too many people try to come in, the staff has a terrible time ensuring the safely of handicapped individuals. These people have the endure long lines, having usual entrances closed (meaning access only with thousands of others pushing their way in) and a manager, Philippe, who cannot tell the truth. We were told the usual entrance that handicapped people use was broken and we had to walk around thousands of people to gain our early access rights. Not 20 minutes later, these same  broken  gates were opened to let day tickets holders in. We have been season tickets holders for years and have never been treated so rudely and without care to physical challenges. There are many wonderful people who do work at Disney, especially the people tasked with getting us on the rides, but management is still very Parisienne in it's attitudes as to how to help people. The attitude we constantly hear from these people is that if you don't like it, don't come here. Not the attitude for the happiest place on Earth. Four hour waits for rides were happening in a very overcrowded park. If I had paid EUR 90 to get in and waited that long... We have come to Disney at other time when the capacity had been reached and could not get in, even as annual pass holders. This should have been done this Halloween weekend, too. Too many people and not enough staff. It is the parks' business to make the place safe for everyone and this just was not happening. Come to Disney and enjoy but don't go on Halloween!","Negative"

"Been to Eurodisney twice before this was our third time....and our last. Has really gone down hill, looking shabby. The worst thing is its half term holidays. So many attractions closed for Maintenance, I understand that they need servicing, however all at the same time! Felt really ripped off, only one ride open in Frontier Land. 2 big rides closed in Adventure Land. Peter Pan ride closed. Very expensive trip. Save your money for America instead.","Negative"

"I had high hopes for this visit as this was the first time I was on an out of country trip with my wife and two kids. My wife had previously been to the Disneyland in Tokyo, myself in California. Both of us had positive memories of those prior trips so we were looking forward to seeing our kids experience the same fun.Boy, were we disappointed. The queues were ridiculous   you can never get to a ride without having to line up for at least 45 minutes. And that's for just a 2 minute ride. Moreover, the whole time you're in the queue you have to be: a) alert for other visitors trying to jump the queue; and b) protecting your children from those visitors who do jump the queue. They were rude and showed absolutely zero consideration for small children.  Happiest place on earth  my foot.The heat and humidity   I guess that's just a side effect of the time of year we went there (August). For the overcrowding   maybe it so happened that it's summer vacation for many in the neighboring countries. Nonetheless I thought I'd mention it now so that those of you planning a visit factor these two things into your plans.So with all that rolled up together, the kids were wanting to leave the park in about two hours at a time (my kids are 4 and 3 years old). We went for just two rides in the course of two days   mainly because my family and I couldn't stand waiting in a queue for an hour in the intense heat and inconsiderate crowd.The only saving grace for our trip was being booked at the Disneyland hotel, and taking advantage of the photo op with the characters at the breakfast buffet. They actually will go from table to table and you won't be constrained for time to wrap up your photos. The downside is having to spend more.I may consider going again if it's the cooler part of the year, and on a school day. But from my recent experience alone I wouldn't recommend it.","Negative"
"We visited Disneyland Paris in July 2014 with our two children aged 2y o and 5y o. I can honestly say, that our boys would have more fun at a good swing park, we arrived at 11am and by 3pm had seen everything, we had an Access Pass to get on rides quicker, but our boys were either too young or too small, but apart from that it just didn't excite them. The only time they got excited was when we visited the Disney store on site and they could pick some toys we hadn't seen before, but even these broke within 24hrs and we are currently waiting for Disney to reply to our email of complaint (which by the way has taken us over 3 days just to get the correct email address from them). Honestly, if you want to experience Disney, go to the states, we didn't even see any characters, I spotted one of the Disney Princess characters about 60ft away, but she was desperate to get out of the way, she wasn't even stopping for photos with young girls eager to meet her, parents were running ahead of her to try and get a photo of her as she walked towards them, I could see the disappointment on so many faces...just shocking. We decided to dine at one of the onsite restaurants, which only served fast food, similar to McDonalds really, I bought two chicken sandwich meals and two children's chicken nugget meals, I also bought two Mickey Mouse straws for the boys...it cost 56 euros, we then had to sit and watch some budget dance show which was like watching dancers that weren't quite good enough for BGT. I will never return to this place, just an overrated Disney world copy and like any copy, it's just not as good!","Negative"
"For kids is OK but for adults is just a nightmare. You spend 1 3 of your time, driving and parking and you spend 1 3 of your time (maybe more) waiting in lines and only the rest is for  playing  with exchibits and the rides. Even less than 1 3 actually since you also need time to eat the average (in general) food options which by the way are the most expensive on earth.","Neutral"

Food was fantastic and eating ice cream at Haagen daas store was yummy! Kids absolutely loved it and weather was fab!","Positive"
"Having stayed at this park five times previously,we have seen how it has deteriorated. There used to be shows and also actors playing out scenes in various locations around the park. Now there is nothing. We stayed 11 13th March when it snowed but no effort was made to clear paths or get rides ready. Lots of attractions were closed or opened late, even the indoor rides. People were walking around wondering what to do with their time. We saw many people slip on the snowy paths. There are an abundance of shops selling overpriced goods in which people were crowded trying to keep warm. The cost of food is ridiculous. We had purchased food vouchers in advance which saved us a little bit of money. I would suggest eating at a restaurant that serves buffet so you can eat as much as you want. The Plaza restaurant was good in the Magic Kingdom as it caters for vegetarians as well. You need to book a time. We stayed at the Newport Bay Club this time. Previously we stayed at the Santa Fe. Our room was nicely decorated but a double bed is a little small for us as neither my husband or myself sleep that well. Our granddaughter enjoyed having a bed all to herself though. The swimming pool was too cold to play around in. We ate breakfast at 7.30am. Any later than this and you would have to queue. It was good to be shown to a table and to keep going back to the buffet. At the Santa Fe we had to get all the food at one go and then find our own table. Drinks were really expensive in the bar. We won't be going back to disneyland Paris again I don't think.","Negative"
"Nothing new since I last went, all looks tired and rides keep breaking down. Still an outrageously expensive day, 90 euros on the door! and all the other expenditure when you are there. Kids loved it of course. I just felt ripped off when I left. Go to Parc Asterix, much more fun.","Negative"
"Having never been to Disneyland I was uncertain how good it would be. I was not disappointed. Queues can be avoided by using the fast pass but even the queues went quick enough. Every ride we went on was brilliant. Hyperspace mountain was my favorite but many others were good. The stunt show was brilliant but the one attraction I could take or leave was Armageddon. Definitely not worth queuing for. Definitely a magical experience all round and worth a visit. Enjoy. ","Positive"
"I actually don't feel that I was in a Disneyland. That was a weekday but there were so many people. I don't even meet any characters there! Nevertheless it did not take long to queue and we managed to see the new iron man show which is fantastic. There were not a lot of eateries around except popcorns! The fireworks and parade were great though. Overall I don't get that fantasy feeling at all but we still enjoyed ourselves with our family. By the way the castle is really small... ","Neutral"

"I went to HKD in early april. The line ups for all of the major rides were really short like 5 15 mins. Which is really short compared to WDW. The weather wasn't so good. It was raining but thats why it was so quiet. We were the first on the jungle river cruise which was fun. But the time to go would be when the weather is not to good because to me the weather didnt affect us on any rides and thats what made the wait times shorter but also dont go on the public holidays because it will get really busy. Go in the off season!","Positive"

"Okay, so I went on my, probably last trip, to Disneyland CA. I   m 60 and have been going to Disneyland since I was six. Absolutely my favorite theme park hands down. This trip however was my first time since becoming partially disabled. I can sit, stand and walk but only for about a minute. I checked out wheelchair accessibility and was pleasantly surprised. They have manual and electric wheelchairs (w c) at the park. How cool!! :) I rented an electric w c, I think it was $20 and well worth it. I didn   t want my wife or daughter to push me around perhaps taking away their enjoyment. The w c rental area is right near the entrance and, of course, great cast members there to assist. I was very self conscious about being in a w c to begin with but these cast members made me feel so welcome and relieved all of my anxieties. In fact all cast members were way over the top, accommodating. Not to mention the electric w c could just about burn rubber. I had been very well briefed on the w c operation when I rented it. Very easy mechanics, a two year old could operate it but was definitely impressed with its speed. It certainly was faster than a person can walk. After a full day of zipping around, I had barely dented the battery charge. When going on a ride, cast members would direct us to where we should go. It was better than having a fast pass. With every ride, the cast members would ask if I could walk, stand etc. usually entertaining a ride from its exit. Once on the ride, the cast would take my w c to where I   d be getting off the ride. Ie. I went in the regular entrance to the Tiki Room and the cast took my w c to the exit. My only problem was people walking in front of me. I would have to slow down so I wouldn   t hit someone if they stopped suddenly. All in all it was a great experience and I owe all that to Disney cast members. They made me feel wanted, welcome and released any anxiety I had of feeling like I was a burden. Thank you to these Cast Members who made my probably last visit to the park, one of my best visits ever. So anyone putting Disneyland on the no fly list because of disability, remove it!!","Positive"
"I am now spoiled. I can not visit another amusement park after Disneyland! They have it down to a system! Never waited more than 35 minutes with what seemed like a million people there! So clean and everyone so eager to make you feel like a guest! ","Positive"
"Top attractions Matterhorn, Railroad, Riverboat and several others are closed for refurbishment. They need it, as they keep stopping. Evacuation procedures are awful, needing more than a half hour to get people off a stopped ride. They don't advise about the closed rides before you buy a ticket, but that is part of the Disney culture: grab as much money as they can. There are lots of other people who will keep the lineups full. You need lots of patience and ways to entertain kids in hour long lineups.","Negative"
"Disney needs to do a better job at parking. Since guests pay a premium, non tagged disabled folk have a long way to go in some circumstances. Special kudos to Mark, a parking lot cashier who we managed to go through each day...fast...efficient...pleasant.Wow...at Disney World they used biometric scanners for readmission. At DL they use an iPhone with your picture.Disney is Disney. They make money on food and merchandise. $3 for a bottle of Coke is ridiculous. Take food stuffs into the parks; remember, you are a captive audience. Through put at fast food outlets is slow. The Imagineers are not just creative at attractions but also adept at concealing lines...weaving in and out, under and over. When a wait time is posted, believe it...it's a science. Perhaps some of those water misters like in Las Vegas would keep things cool.Park cleanliness seems to be slipping a bit. They might take a hint from the subways in Paris which use a scented compound to provide a fresher smell.I won't complain about lines; we went at a time when schools were there and also grad nights. Google before you go. Use a smartphone app to get ride times.Some employees are very nice others are smarmy. We also had the dry ice Disney employee bomber while we were there. You just tell your kids,  It's just a dry ice and be glad it's not Mentos and $3 16 oz. Cokes.","Neutral"

"First queued for 45 minuets for opening then at ten o   clock it opened well we thought it had opened , no got to Main Street with a white line across the street to be stopped by staff , which honestly made the gestapo look like angels you dared cross the line and they were on you like a pack of hungry wolves do not cross the line the park opens at 10.30am another half hour wait .Half past ten came and by this time there were thousands waiting to go which to me was dangerous as people surged to get to the rides , but wait only certain parts were open the rest wouldn   t open until 11.00am again chains across the paths and more aggressive border guards ( don   t cross the line ) this put a real down on the day if we knew we would have waited until lunch before going .The park it self is quiet small and the rides just average and after the opening downer we stayed for lunch and left before 2.00pm , my advice is good for families but don   t go until after lunch unless you want to stand around for hours while the whole park opens and you aren   t scared to cross the line in case of snipers and aggressive border guards ( even kids were aggressively told not to cross the line )All in all if your only adults don   t bother a waste of money better spent elsewhere Magic kingdom it ain   t more like Stalag 17","Negative"

"Classic Disney done superbly. Even with the crowds, the park and the rides were easy to navigate. The lines were long but most moved quickly. The food was a little expensive, but there were plenty of healthy options so we didn't mind as much. It's A Small World ride was closed, which was disappointing, but otherwise, the park and the service was absolutely wonderful. The character breakfast was a little crazy, but we finally got to meet some of the characters. Altogether, we had a great time!","Positive"
"I've been to Disneyland over 100 times, and there is no where like it in the world   even Disney World parks don't compare. The ambiance you feel is truly magical, and my kids absolutely love going. We'll stay open to close, and still not have time to see everything! Please be sure to visit at least a couple of days so you don't miss World of Color at California Adventure, and Fantasmic which is simple breathtaking.","Positive"
"I have been visiting Disneyland Park since it opened and they keep changing the venues offten enough to keep me interested...still love the Tea Cups...parking is still a bit of a hassel and time consuming...the cues for tickets is getting better...","Positive"
"Had a great time. Went on lots of the rides. Aerosmith was defiantly the best ride by far!  Highly recommend for a family of all ages","Positive"
"Cost us nearly 500 euro for 3 kids (11, 10 and 8) and 2 adults, 9 rides in total where under refurbishment between the two parks these included Thunder mountain, Swiss family robinsons treehouse, pirate galleon, Pirates beach, adventure isle, star tours, neptunes submarine, Armageddon and rock and roll coaster. Here's a little hint to Disney......I understand rides need to be refurbished but how about you discount the tickets for how many rides that are undergoing refurbishment. This is the only place in the world I have seen that you pay full price for half the park.. What a joke and to think this cost me $700 Australian dollars entry for 4 hours to complete both parks....Never again!!!!!","Negative"

"We went to the park for three days it was an amazing experience. The parade was brilliant. The rides were good. We loved the shows and loved meeting the characters. We were gutted that we didn   t see the fireworks as we were all too tired. Hopefully we could go back one day to watch them! Would recommend especially with children watching our five year old twins faces was just magical. Would definitely recommend going on the ride    a small world    ","Positive"
"A dump is a polite way of describing this place!Basically they clearly don't care. The place is filthy, the rides seem like they're run by people who have never run them before as they're so slow and disorganised. This is no comparison to Florida and not even remotely close.","Negative"
"I would be very wary of visiting this place again ever. You had long queues everywhere, and at least 3 breakdowns due to technical problems after waiting for an hour in queue each time....no options given...just asked to leave. Including one attraction which was closed due to problems at 1030am, there were at least 4 attractions which had technical problems....a bit too high. The only train service connecting the different disneylands, would not allow you to board if you are the 51st person in the queue....the justification offered was that more people have to board at the next station....not taking into account the fact that there might be people getting down there. Overall...seemed like a place set up to frustrate you and to prevent you from doing more than few rides   events a day. Very badly managed overall and the people manning the attractions werent friendly to say the least.","Negative"
"Get there extremely early and stay for the night show. The lines get very long even for the small things like  Its a small world.  When I was there, many rides were out of commission. The Lucky Nugget has amazing BBQ for European standards. It was a magic day!","Positive"
"We visited Disneyland Paris on Sunday 12 and Monday, October 13th 2014 Too bad the whole weekend there were many technical faults at the attractions . Very long lines and fastpas tickets that were issued in the morning though . Furthermore, the toilets were dirty. For a Ben and Jerry ice stood 25 minutes in line. Also, there it was in fact very dirty. I will definitely recommend anyone to go to Disneyland Paris. Very expensive tickets, a waste of youre money.","Negative"
"Its Disney! Very hard to do in one day but we hit all the highlights   weekday visit last week of July   crowd meter at 9 out of 10 but really the only wait was at Space Mountain (50 minutes) and Splash Mountain (posted 110 minutes, we left the line after 20). My five year olds liked the 'little kids' rides more than I expected them to   Toon Town and FantasyLand.","Positive"
"We had a great time here in a cold week in March. The park was looking great, the staff were all helpful and friendly   I am not sure what they have for breakfast to make them all so chirpy but most people should have this!We went previously two years ago and I was not looking forward to the queues, but this was so much better than before   probably because the weather wasn't as nice. The 'big rides' were great, we particularly liked Pirates of the Caribbean which had hardly no queue and I enjoyed both Space Mountain 2 and Indiana Jones with a straight 'walk on'. Big Thunder Mountain and Buzz Lightyear were family favourites and we made use of Fast Pass for this, and I would highly recommend this.The shows were excellent, both the 5pm parade but particularly the evening light and fireworks show   absolutely superb. One thing (probably being British) is that there is a complete absence of understanding what personal space is   where on the map does this get lost? Also, the characters are far less evident now and it is a bit of a 'free for all'   and anyone over the age of (say) 16 should be a little embarrassed to be pushing themselves to the front ahead of young children for photos. I'm not sure why some grown men feel the need to do this, they probably need more sport and beer in their lives...!Anyhow, to finish on a positive   our family had a great time at Disneyland Park and some great memories were made.","Positive"

"What did we do at Disney. Spent a lot of time walking around and queuing. A LOT of time, in the baking heat. The kids enjoyed the attractions we got to experience, and the closing time show was stupendous. But the management seems lacking. Quite a few of the rides were closed. Others had technical faults. The food outlets (all of which are overpriced, and based on our experiences are not good) are open at random times, particularly in the morning. And where is the commercial and customer satisfaction logic in having the drinks and ice cream facilities closed in the really hot weather of the last few days? It seems Disney haven't realised yet that the weather is different in France to California or Florida, and that if you're expecting people to queue for 45 minutes (which has been the standard queue length this last three days) then leaving them exposed to hot sun or heavy rain or frost and snow without some form of cover might not be attractive.","Negative"
"We took my 2 small grandkids (ages 6 and 3) to the Happiest Place on Earth for New Year's to enjoy the rides. Got there early and got our 2 strollers, so everyone would make it to fireworks. The first few hours were great hopping on and off rides. By afternoon the place was crowded    okay that's normal. Never could get a place to see the parades    too many people. Late afternoon, you could barely move because they roped off and shut the streets while installing bands. (Hum, I thought this place was about the rides but we stood patiently waiting trying to get across the streets and down sidewalks like the other 85,000  people.) Early evening, people are now body to body against the ropes, rails, and walls. People were trying to push through the crowds and were falling over our strollers against my grandkids. People were angry at being stopped and just being forced to stand in one spot while thousands of others crowded in behind them. Adults were vying on the streets for the best spot to see the NO NAME bands. By 8 p.m. they had closed down the rides because no one could tell where the normally long lines ended or began because every available area had people standing and waiting ... waiting for what? They closed the rides so there was nothing to do but listen to bands    excuse me Disneyland    we didn't go there so we could take our toddlers to a Night Club atmosphere!!! We paid almost $600 for one day, so we could ride the rides, see the parades, and watch fireworks. My grandchildren only saw the backs of the legs of the people standing in the crowd in front of them who were at a dead halt hoping to see the bands. It took us 2 hours to make it from the Castle down Main Street to the gate. If there had been any kind of emergency, we would all have been crushed by people trying to get out. You expect crowds at Disneyland if you've ever gone there before. I've worked in security and crowd control for years, and believe Disneyland did not have adequate crowd control plans or people to handle such an event. If they repeat this next year, they can advertise Disney's new event and call it a  Frightmare on Main Street !!!!","Negative"
"Usual Disneyland affair but disappointing as it is a lot smaller than other Disney affairs e.g. Florida. This makes the experience much less real as you can see the mountains etc   so you know you are not in DL but actually in a theme park in Hong Kong.At least the tube station was fun with Mickey Mouse themes throughout.I wouldn't recommend it but if you are a Disney fan then it might be worth a visit just to say  I've been ","Negative"
"not a scratch on Disney world were everything is possible and staff are smiley and polite.  This place was the opposite which is probably why we did't see any Americans.","Negative"
"Having heard so much about this place we just had to go.I must say however that the one disappointment for me was that everywhere you turned there were shops selling memorabilia.If you look past that however it is a great place that lives up to the expectations of many kids and times their smiling faces everywhere you turn (except for the ones who have fallen asleep) that is priceless","Positive"
"Hong Kong Disney land is so small compare to the other Disney land moreover some of visitor don't know how to queue and that make this place more annoying.","Neutral"
"If you've been to Disneyworld, visit Disneyland just for the experience. It's like the mini version. Comparatively speaking, it's mostly like the Magic Kingdom in Florida. Go when the gates open and hit the hot spots (start with the Indiana Jones Adventure). It said it was a 10 minute wait when we went  pretty much 5 minutes of that was walking from that sign to the inside part of the ride. I am an Indiana Jones fan and I was not at all impressed with this ride. Ride the Matterhorn Bobsleds  not found in WDW. It's a jerky ride though, and not intended for tall people as its uncomfortable to get in and out of. Space mountain is different than WDW  almost completely in the dark. Great ride. Pirates of the Caribbean here is better than WDW (yet another ride you should hit first to avoid crowds). The Haunted Mansion isn't scary at all  it has a  Nightmare Before Christmas theme). Awesome and very well done.","Neutral"

"Never been to a place full of so much happiness. The characters are amazing. The Star Wars rollercoaster is crazy and the Peter Pan ride. There is lots of little food stalls dotted around and it   s spaced out well, you can spend the whole day there. Didn   t spend longer than half an hour for the rides. If you do 1 ride then definitely do the studio tram tour and hotel tower of terror (both at universal).They do a Halloween themed parade at 12pm and 5pm is the main character parade. It was brilliant. The fireworks start around 8.30 9ish. It was the best thing I   ve ever seen. Just be careful with any bags as there is thousands of people.","Positive"
"honestly... i didn't like it much. I have been to disney land in orlando and does not compare even 50% to it. the parade was not as thrilling as the one in America. I did not enjoy it much but for disney park first timers, they might enjoy it.","Neutral"
"We were disappointed. I bought tickets for two parks, but due that lots of rides where out of order or that have aged a lot, I thought it was not worth it. Maybe it would be better to go there in the summer when there is more going on or to put it different where there are more options available and the staff isn't off. We encountered several food stalls, that were out of salty food (hamburger french fries) by 13:00 (1 pm!). So we went into the big eating   souvenir hall and the people were sitting on the floor, as there was not enough place to sit outside inside to have once's lunch?!? I was amazed what I saw there. Also some registers where closed and the lines where really really long just to get food.I don't get it, why not limit the amount of people if the park cannot provide enough food or places to sit?","Negative"
"We were lucky! The day we went to disneyland, the typhoon Beaufort force 8 signal was just reduced to a 3. So not many people were in Disneyland. All ride ques were less than 5 minutes wait! We got to enjoy all the rides indoors and some outdoors (when the typhoon force reduced to 1). The park still opens despite rain. Magical experience. Felt happy. The environment was friendly. Many staff around to guide you. Good attractions. Plenty food options around. Delicious food. If it is raining, just go around in a raincoat!","Positive"
"Such an awesome place for people of all ages. The whole park has been so well designed and no expense has been spared. Characters come out in full character, try to get a photo with all of them if you can. But you'll see pretty much all of them in the shows. If you've got the time and the money, then do this park over two days, if you have young kids. Summers pretty hot, and there is lot of people all the time. Plus its gets pretty late by the time you've seen the fireworks and the water show. don't miss either. Otherwise you can do the park in one day like we did, but you'll have to do a bit of research on what ride you want to go on, and the order to do them in, also plan out your fast pass. Food and drinks are expensive so see if you can take your own. If you're going during summer, take your own water sprayer, otherwise you'll be paying $20 for a $5 spray bottle. Let the staff take your photos with the characters with both their and your camera. You dont need to buy theirs photos, but if yours come out bad, then you've got a back up. Get to the parade early so you get a seat at the front, otherwise you'll have to stand.","Positive"
"This is my favorite place to visit! We go between 3  6 times a year and it is worth the trip. This is the perfect place to take a family.","Positive"
"too bad can't see the parade, only the choco train parade becoz of the sudden and long raining:( Twice went there on Monday and Saturday and still no parade","Positive"
"We went early in the morning however it was probably the worst time to go. I would recommend going in the afternoon and if you   re ok to skip the parade then that   s the best time to go on the rides as there is little or no lines! Going in summer with kids is challenging but no matter they still enjoy it and it   s worth it for the young kids. ","Neutral"
"Exceptional reception staff at Euro Disney who were very helpful and friendly. We had bought tickets through Expedia and we could not find how to print vouchers. Woman at the desk knew what the problem was and very politely refused to allow me to pay for replacement tickets, even although I insisted as I didn   t want to hold the queue up and the problem wasn   t theirs.I was taken to a very private area out of the sight of other guests where Hocine helped me access my private email account then find and print my tickets. Not only that but because he was worried that not being able to find my Expedia tickets may have spoilt the day he then gave me vouchers for some soft drink and ice creams and a priority pass for one of the rides. I have already written a commendation for Hocine as I work as a customer manager and know how good his service was. I will also be writing to the head of Disney Europe, they need to know about these people and reward them.Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck had impeccable manners and treated all guests kindly and patiently, as you would expect from two of the main characters. All other staff had genuine smiles and were very helpful when asked questions.Whilst queues for meals were long they did at least move fairly quickly. The longest queue was maybe 15 minutes and the park was full.Yes it was fast food (not junk food) but with a good French twist. Whilst I will moan like mad when I get bad service, I did not complain once at Disney.As for some of the people moaning about kids, it   s a theme park, what on earth do you expect. From my experience there were only a slack handful of annoying ones. Continental parents know how to keep their children in check.The closing show with fireworks was an absolute must.Trains after show run till 0010   plenty of time to get to central Paris. Remember to buy return zone 1 to 5 tickets before leaving Paris.","Positive"

"Where to start... ok.. we arrived to where the Disneyland at 9 on the dot. The park opens at 9. and the parking lot for the park was closed.. not full.. just closed, so it took us 40 minutes to move up 1 block to turn around. Only to be forced to park at Downtown Disney then have to walk all the way to the park  no shuttle.. nothing. Then we had to wait in line to have a tiny purse that can only hold a camera checked for what seemed like half a day. Eventually made it in the park a bit past 11am. We go inside the park.. only to find out a bunch of the rides are closed! When we asked for directions or where the restroom was.. EVERY employee in the park had an attitude. I asked where I could find a map for the park and was told  outside . The bathrooms are so so so so old and dirty. There was zero control over the lines as well. People kept cutting the lines for EVERY ride!! It was crazy! I've been to many amusement parks and several times to Disneyworld and have NEVER had this issue! Also, there were no park photographers anywhere. At Disneyworld, they're everywhere! In Disneyland, we found 1. Ride operators.. super rude as well. The whole experience was pretty much ruined from the start. Not magical at all. I will 100% NEVER be going back again. I love Disneyworld Orlando and will be sticking to that in the future. OH.. and the food WAS. SO. NASTY. SO SO SO NASTY!!","Negative"
"We visited in Mid February with boys aged 6 and 12, staying at Newport Bay for three nights. Our included pass covered four days so we managed to get to the park for the parade on arrival day. One bonus we weren't expecting were vouchers for a doughnut or magnum ice lolly plus a drink which could be exchanged between 3 and 6pm at selected restaurants. The downside was having to queue for 20 minutes to get them!The queues were the biggest bug bear even with the extra hours. Yes, you can get into the Disneyland Park at 8am but very few rides start then and the gates open to the rest of the public before 9.30 so the queue to get into Frontierland etc for the popular rides like Big Thunder Mountain are horrendous by the time these areas open. As soon as the barriers go down, there is a mad scramble to the rides with people running and shoving. Despite being in the queue to get into Frontierland at 9.30 am, we still ended up waiting for 45 minutes in the ride queue i.e. finally getting on at 10.45, The fastpass system is also hopeless with the tickets all gone within about half an hour. Also, there's no early entry to the Studio park.Some rides are worth a bit of a wait   Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones, Buzz Lightyear, Ratatouille, Peter Pan among them. However, many are very old fashioned basic fairground rides showing their age. Several big rides were closed for maintenance.We were shocked by the prevalence of smoking. Although there are meant to be designated areas, we saw many people puffing away around children. Only once did we see anyone being politely challenged.Many have commented on the extortionate price of food and drink. We made up sandwiches at breakfast and came armed with snacks.Signage is very poor in the parks and maintenance standards leave a lot to be desired. Surely, blown bulbs could be replaced in the illuminated signs. Perhaps this is a ploy to avoid everyone finding their way directly to the popular rides!Our boys had no interest in any meet and greet opportunities but we did see long queues.Overall, the children enjoyed their time and we managed to get on most rides they wanted. The closing firework and light show was excellent. The staff were unfailingly good humoured and very helpful. The safety checks were thorough on every ride. We were very glad to be a ten minute walk from the hotel especially to take advantage of the swimming pool as a break from the mayhem of the park. So Disney, yes we had a good time and a lot of fun but would we return   I'm afraid a definite no!","Neutral"
"Really is the place where dreams come true! Great few days in the park experiencing everything I could. Only drawback is no fast pass on some attractions. Can be expensive, budgeting might be needed for food options etc but totally worth it!!!!","Positive"
"Here's an abridged copy of the complaint email I've sent to DLP...I visited with my teenage daughter and her friend. We last visited 10 years ago when my children were much younger, and I have to say that the park has seriously declined in that time.  We have only ever visited during school holidays, so knew that it was going to be very crowded, and we arrived before the official opening time, expecting long queues around the busiest parts of the day.  We didn't mind the queues and thoroughly enjoyed the rides and attractions once we were able to reach them, but, a major difference from our previous visits was that there were far fewer Disney  cast members  around to answer any queries or give directions. Furthermore, while some of them were polite and helpful, a number were more like Grumpy from the Seven Dwarfs   no smiles and unwilling or unable to offer much help. In comparison, when we have visited in the past, there were plenty of Disney staff in evidence throughout the queues (not just at the embarkation point), who would chat and answer questions   and crucially, ask people to stop smoking. This time I was appalled at the number of people smoking cigarettes around the park with no one stopping them.  For an attraction aimed at young children, with rules that ask people not to smoke outside designated areas, this is unforgivable.  Although we were able to avoid smokers walking around the park, we of course had no option to stand near them if they were smoking in the (long) queues. Had I seen any cast members in evidence, I would have pointed this out and asked the staff member to tell the smokers to stop   but the apparent reduction in staffing meant it was not possible for me to complain to anyone in authority.  We queued for 50 minutes to ride Pirates of the Caribbean, only for the ride to break down before we had chance to embark. While these sort of things do happen, it left me wondering if your evident reduction in staffing levels is also extending to less maintenance for the rides. And the queueing area for Big Thunder Mountain was dirty, with overflowing rubbish bins   I have attached a photograph I took as we queued for an hour for this ride. Not the sort of holiday picture I really want to bring home, and it reflects on your organisation very badly. It appears that far from the Disney  Magic , what has developed is an attitude of far less attention to detail, a lack of adequate staffing and poor training management of cast members.  Your marketing makes much of the Disney  Magic , but if this isn't in evidence, then families like ours will choose to go elsewhere in future   there are plenty of other theme parks to choose from these days. I shall share these experiences with people I know, including on internet forums where people discuss their holiday plans   and I await your response with interest.","Neutral"
"Avoided taking the kids to DL but couldn't avoid it any longer. We finally did it this year and it turned out to be a great trip for the family. I'm not a Disney fan but once you're there, you can't help but get taken in! Tomorrow land, with the new Star Wars themed rides were really fun and a definite favorite for the older kids in our family. With three kids of varying ages, we had to go in with a plan. You'll hear it many times, but it bears repeating: ride the popular rides early, get those Fast Passes, download an App with the wait times. The fried chicken is yummy and so are the beignets, wish I had room for a churro.","Positive"
"Having had an excellent time in Disney Florida a few years ago we were excited to be spending two days here when visiting California.Very disappointed. We left early and we didn't come back on the second day ... we went to Six Flags Magic Mountain instead.The selection of rides is limited if you are looking for some thrill rides and certainly doesn't offer the same scope and scale as their park in Florida.Service was great as was the ambiance in the park.... just not recommended if you are with teenagers.","Negative"
"Disneyland Paris   frustrating, inefficient, inept and a total waste of money. We travelled out to Marne la Vallais to be part of Mickey's Magical Party. We booked a day's ticket for the three of us   myself and my two children for   118   ouch. On the basis of the cost alone one would have expected something fairly special.With our 'home printed' tickets we arrived at around 10am opening time on the Tuesday following Easter. The admittance procedure was chaotic and stressful with massive surging crowds around the turnstiles with very little guidance, charm or direction from the Dsiney staff. When we finally were pushed and shoved to the front of the queue, the girl on the barier managing to swipe one of the tickets twice which meant that we had to submit to an exhaustive security check as they suggested that I was presenting forged tickets!Having cleared that up, we managed to get straight onto Space Mountain with a mximum 20 minute queue and that certainly lived up to its name. An awesome Roller Coaster in the dark that totally terrified but delighted the kids!Things from that point went downhill. What my 'cheap' deal for the days ticket didn't tell me was that it excluded Fast Pass so you couldn't apply for an alloted time with Fast Pass Scheme to go on one of the more popular rides   hence saving time and minimising the queueing. The queues were on average 50 mins with everyone obediently shuffling around the little taped off sections for their 5 minute experience that rarely lived up to the hype. We spent more time in queues than we did 'having fun'. There appeared to be total indiffernce from Disneyland 'Cast Members' about the lenght of the queues or any attempt to entertain people whilst they were waiting   merely a bored gallic shrug.There were also very few Disney character is evidence. Part of the fun for the kids was to collect as many autographs as you can   brilliant if any of the characters were in evidence. We scored Wendy and Peter Pan plus a couple of Chipmunks and that was it. Not sure where the rest went, perhaps they were in hiding as I hear Mickey gets routinely mobbed everytime he puts in an appearance.Lunch though was the total joke. The kids were on for Pizza so we headed for the Bella Notte; looked and sounded promising. The system for ordering food was so chaotic that I stood in line for almost an hour before being served with microwaved lasagne, limp Pizza and a salad that was a long way past its best. The cost   40 for food that your local suprmarket would be too proud to sell you.The day was partially salvaged by an impressive Parade and a the ride (again after a marathon queue) on the Tower of Terror next door in Disny Studios. Asdie from the last hour, I wished we'd stayed in Paris and saved our money. The kids were underwhelmed too which somehow defeated the whole object.I hate to be so critical however we did go to Eurodisney about 8 years ago when the kids were younger and had a wonderful time so had high expectations. To say we were disappointed was an understatement. Its interesting that having booked online that many leisure companies are concerned about hearing feedback but not Disney. They just send you an email to sell you more stuff and experiences. The Worl famous and renowned American service culture is completely unknown here.After the prices charged and the value given in exchange   we felt a lot poorer and just a tad ripped off.","Negative"
"I grew up in California near the original Disneyland and was excited to visit Disneyland Hong Kong. When we arrived, it was as expected; typical Disney with the beautiful entry leading up to the entrance. Once we got inside, it reminded me of Disneyland California. The layout was exact. However, once we began to roam around, we realized it was missing quite a few things the Disneyland has in California and was a much smaller park. At any rate, the park is a fun place if you have kids as most of the rides are geared towards the younger children and not much for adults to do. However, it's still Disneyland, and you gotta go just so that you can say you've been there :)If in town for a few days, Disneyland is a good choice for 1 day of fun.","Neutral"
"The 20 years special parades were really good and the light and fireworks show on the castle was one of the best Disney attractions I have seen. Amazing. Only problem was the night time parade started at 10.15pm and the light show at 11.00pm. You got back to the hotel after midnight which was very late for our 6 year old granddaughter.","Positive"
"I've wanted to visit Disneyland for as long as I can remember....and I finally got the chance to do it with my own children.I purchased the SoCal pass on Expedia that allows 3 day park hopper access to Disneyland (with Magic Morning) and DCA as well as one day at both Universal Hollywood and Seaworld in San Diego.Disneyland is an amazing experience....there isn't really anything I could write that could improve upon other reviews. The rides are only part of the fun....there's parades, great food and shops and we really enjoyed the thrill of finding characters, getting their autographs and having photos taken with them.We also purchased separate tickets to Mickey's Halloween Party.....we scored lots of candy....met some harder to find characters and the lines for some rides were a bit shorter. I was anticipating a smaller crowd, but it seemed to be about the size as any other time of day.Of course there are crowds and lines, waiting becomes part of the game though.....get an app like Mousewait and it'll help with deciding which ride attraction to head to next.Because I was there with young children, some of the  scarier  rides were left unridden and there was still heaps more to see and do even after 2 days there (we spent the other day and a half at DCA)....I can't wait to go back!Oh....and try a jumbo turkey leg!!","Positive"
"Not much to say, it's a nice park, nice to walk around and take in the atmosphere but other than that there is not much there for big kids. There were no looping rides and everything inside was too expensive (usual). Worth going for one day, you should be able to do everything you want within the day.","Neutral"
"The themes , park facilities and attractions are nice and no doubt the children have lovely time with the grownups having some fond memories returning to them .However the queues for entering an attraction are horrible from 20mins to 45 mins averaging 30 mins , probably in spring or summer that is fine but in the winter this is horrible at least the park owners should have heaters were the queues form for the customers to warm up a bit.","Neutral"
"Firstly, for the amount of money we paid, which was the cheapest we could find it, it worked out more expensive than going to Walt Disney World minus the flights. Unfortunatley we noticed problems as soon as we arrived in France.  We booked to use the disney coach to take us from the airport to the hotel. When we got to the airport we found the coach stop and it was already full with people on the pavement and on the road. There was no queue system and this resulted in some heated discussions between passengers. When a coach finally turned up we were not helped with our bags and people were pushing to get on the coach. The bag thing didn't bother me as much but I felt sorry for the families with children and prams. My boyfriend also banged his head quite hard on the boot of the coach which didn't help matters   he was simply not used to putting things in a coach! The driver would not let people on the coach unless the whole group was together so he could scan the tickets as people get on. This would have been fine if there had been someone helping with bags and there had been a queue system   people were panicing to get on as it was clear there would not be room for everyone. I could not believe it when we got on the coach and the windscreen was smashed with a piece of plastic backing stuck over the top of it. Furthermore, throughout the journey the driver was talking on his phone! I know the law might be different in France but there is simply no excuse for putting 40 peoples lives at risk just to speak to your friend. Also, he was playing his own chart music very loud. To me non of this equates to the disney magic I expected. If I compare this service to the service I received in Orlando, that is a complimentary service might I add, it does not match up on any level. When you arrive at the airport in Orlando a red carpet awaits you and you are checked in at a desk so they know you have arrived. Your bags are put on for you and taken off when you arrive at your desitination. Furthermore, there are screens on the coaches in Disney World that play an overview of what the parks and hotels are like with all the characters involved and it keeps you entertained on the 40 minute journey. Furthermore, the driver speaks to you throughout telling you where you are and how far away we are   this did not happen on the Paris coach.  The hotel was nice and the staff were pleasant  we stopped at Sequoia Lodge, but there were broken things in the room and VERY small towels. However the beds were very comfortable and there were always new toiletries provided. Also, the surroundings were absolutely stunning, we could have walked round the hotel area for ages.  In terms of the parks, the attention to detail with the restaurant and ride decors plus the walkways and different areas was what made the holiday for me the park was genuinely beautiful (in places) and made for some great pictures. However, some rides broke down four or five times and we were queuing for crazy amounts of time when the park was not at full capacity. If I again compare this to walt disney world I was there at the end of July 2012 and we did not queue for longer than 30 mins. Furthermore, the toilets were very clean as were most of the restaurants we went in. However, the outside bins were overflowing so we were stood in queues with huge wasps flying round. This would never have happened in Orlando   probably due to there very good underground bin system!The Dreams fireworks were brilliant but it was completely RUINED by people smoking standing pushing each other and myself out of the way to get the best spot. When wishes comes on in Orlando the whole thing is just more organised, no  one stands on the road   so that you can leave if you need too and everyone has enough room to be able to see. Overall, the holiday was enjoyable but it certainly depends what you make of it and I can't say I felt relaxed. People smoking in the parks nearly ruined it for me. If anyone is thinking of going to Paris I would seriously suggest that you consider saving for a bit longer and go to Orlando   they seem to care a lot more about you as a guest and really instil magic throughout your whole stay.","Neutral"
"Disney goofed! The location is easy to get to but it is located too close to France's favorite French theme park. So mostly people from other countries such as the Netherlands are in this park. Smoking is allowed. The food was not good. The staff speaks a variety of languages so this is not an issue. I would not go back. Prices are super high !!!","Negative"
"Though it's much smaller than Disneyland Tokyo it's still a very worth and excellent experience. It's even better that you don't need to rush for the rides.","Positive"
"Very clean and organized park. Nicely put and enough signage. Very friendly and helpful staff EVERYWHERE, let it be at the entrance, in the restaurant or at the rides. For two adults with no kids including lunch a 3 4 hour visit is plenty enough to see and use almost all (age suitable ; )) rides.","Positive"
"We took our 2 and 6 years old to Disneyland and had an OK time. It was very crowded, but thankfully lineups for the children's rides were manageable. The merry go round, Pinocchio, Storybrook boat ride, Jungle Cruise, and even Casey's Circus Train had short waits. Autopia had a manageable 15 minute wait. It was only the higher end rides like Star Tours and other Tomorrowland rides that were 45 to 50 minutes.Experience was typical for a Disney park. Food was passable, mostly edible. Still, what I don't like about Disneyland is that you're charged for Mobile FastPass. As far as I'm aware, Mobile FastPass is free in Florida, but Disney charges $10 per day, per person for the privilege to book rides on a mobile app. This I think is unacceptable ... mobile booking should be a complimentary convenience considering the price of the tickets.Because of the fact Disney charges extra for mobile booking, we won't be going back to Disneyland Park and instead sticking with Florida,. Maybe that's their evil plan after all to alleviate crowding?","Neutral"
"Where to start! Arrived in Eurodisney on the Friday afternoon for my granddaughters 3rd birthday, 5 of us. Stayed 2 nights in Hotel New York. We had booked 2 rooms both with 2 double beds but they gave us rooms with just 1 bed in each so that was the 1st problem. They did change them with no bother but it all took time. Once we had dumped our bags we headed straight out to the Disney studios as its smaller so we thought save the main park for the full day on Saturday. Totally unimpressed. Absolute chaos and so disorganised. My daughter & granddaughter queued up 4 an hour just to have a photo taken with Mickey Mouse, which is fine but not when you have older adults pushing in front to get their photo taken with him and the staff not saying anything to them! We were a bit peckish after this so went to one of the (not very) fast food places for a snack. What a mistake. Yet another queue because they 'forgot' our order. They were extremely slow serving everyone and it didn't look very hygienic, or safe, cleaning down the work tops with a mini pressure washer. The tea was like dishwater and they used hot milk in it! In fact every cup of tea I had was made with hot milk! Awful. Anyway we only went on 2 rides because of the disorganised queues. We had booked Cafe Mickey for the 1st night and that was brilliant purely for the fact that the characters walk round and let you take photos with your child, my granddaughter loved it especially Tigger and Goofy. They made her giggle uncontrollably by tickling her under her chin and making a fuss of her and not just the once either. The food wasn't at all bad, didn't feel rushed and the waiter was lovely. The next day (Saturday) we set out for the main park. My god, I've never seen so many people pushing and shoving to get through the entrance barriers! Some nationalities don't understand the concept of queueing. Atrocious behaviour from grown adults who couldn't give a fig about pushing toddlers and young children out of the way and the dismal land staff didn't help at all. The park was so busy we only went on a couple of rides and then we had to queue for ages. Some queues were advertising a 2 hour wait for rides and even queuing for a fast pass was up to an hour long! Went to Annette's Diner the 2nd night which was average for food and if you're on the plump side you wouldn't fit in the booths! The best bit was when the waiting staff burst into song and dance to Grease Lightning and encouraged diners to join in, great free floor show. Everything in the park is overly priced so take loads of money. One final thing, don't know if it's just me but I think there's something a little bit weird and sinister about grown adults hugging the Characters and getting their autographs!","Negative"
"WOW! From the moment you enter the park you are emerged in a magical,dream world. You won't know which way to go first, what ride to do first. Have a plan before you go, you will definitely need 2 days to explore Disneyland, even three days if you want to take it a leisurely pace and not run everywhere. If you are able to enter the park at 8am you have an advantage because you will be able to be the first to ride the most popular attractions. There are always queues at Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Peter Pan, Autopia, Phatom Manor and Thunder Mountain. Most rides have queues which state the waiting times and I have to admit we never waited longer than 15 minutes for a ride even though is stated '30 minutes . If you are able to get 'fast passes' save them for the busiest rides. Food; there are a lot of options, most of the cheaper restaurants serve the same, burgers, pasta, and hot dogs, there are other restaurants (more expensive) that offer a various selection of other foods. Don't miss the spectacular light show which is held in the evening against the castle, the best place to stand is near the stage. Don't miss the parade, there was only one when we were there and it was amazing. People start waiting for these shows at least an hour before it starts. Face painting is amazing in Fantasyland. Do wear comfortable shoes, you will be walking around a lot! Take lots of money for shopping, you will find many souvenir shops. Plan before you go so you don't miss anything you really want to do but if you do miss anything you can always return again one day.","Positive"
"The cast members in some instances were not friendly, nor was the service on rides, kiosks, or stores what we have become accustomed to at a Disney resort. If Walt Disney were alive and waking around his park, I think he would be alarmingly surprised. The parade and fireworks were wonderful as always. Toontown is in the sun almost all day and the wee ones couldn't ride anything because of the 100 degree heat. It was a waste of time to even walk over there. The train station on Main Street didn't have a ramp for strollers to get to the station requiring two people to carry the stroller upstairs. We couldn't find a handicapped ramp or elevator to get up there. Park hours have been reduced and ticketing prices have gone up, up, and away. Of course, this maximizes their profit and bottom line. We stayed at one of their hotels and the extra hour does no good because only a limited number of rides are open that extra hour. It is almost like they don't want you there anymore.","Negative"
"I really felt bad for our kids since we have spent more time in waiting than playing , the queue for each game was more than 1 hour so we got tired easily and discovered the day was over without enjoying as much as we wanted . it will not make any difference if you come early or late to Disney since you will maximum play 3 games anyway for being tired from the long waiting .we just took it as a onetime experience and for sure we will not come back . don   t stay late before the closing as the train can get full and for sure you are tired and have to wait for another queue to go back home .","Negative"
"Staff everywhere were just friendly, the customer service is just top notch everywhere!It does help to speak French but there's lots of staff who are multilingual so we spoke Italian and German a few times!One of the best presents I bought my partner and she loved it all over!","Positive"
"We attended on a Saturday   after waiting nearly 20 minutes in a security checkpoint line and 15 mins to gain entry into the park. Disney has to improve this process, mass confusion!Most rides are 1 hour wait so you'll be lucky to ride 8 10 rides. We attended the Star Wars section which I thought was pretty cool. If it wasn't for Star Wars the visit would have been disappointed.","Neutral"

I cant even talk the kids into giving it another try.","Negative"

"My husband and I took our 3 children ( aged 14,11 and 6) to euro disney for 4 days over new year. It was a very costly 4 days!! We stayed In the Disneyland hotel which is at the entrance gates. The park is really lovely and I completely agree with the previous review from browneyedowl. The ques were too long and very few staff on hand to offer help or assist ace. The park was very busy and we also found it impossible to sit with a coffee to warm up before trying new rides. We were lucky enough to have golden tickets from the hotel to let us skip a few ques we also entered the parks early when they were quiet. The fast passes are good but it takes a while to get to grips with it all! The parades and the lighting of the Christmas tree were fantastic. The look on the faces of my daughters were enough to make the whole experience worth while. The food is very bad and incredible expensive. This coupled with the miserable staff makes it a very sad experience! If you can then do take a picnic, there are lockers so you don't need to carry it all day.","Neutral"
"The rides were fun but I think more needed to add more fun. My kids personally enjoy this. Not a must for Paris goers. But if you have time to spend n bringing your kids why not. To carve smile n laughter from them is priceless!","Neutral"
"Kids ages 12 and 9.We went during spring break with a crowd level of 10. We knew it would be busy and crowded. I know part of Disneyland's charm is that it is the original Disney park that Walt himself helped build. I hate to be Debbie downer but the place needs to be updated. Other parks incorporate shade for when it's busy and lines are long. Pirates of the Carribean was awful to wait for in the sun for an example.Loved the rides, they did not disappoint. I waited all my life to ride Space Mountain which is now my fave! My families fave rides were Indiana Jones, Matterhorn, Star Tours, Haunted Mansion, It's A Small World...","Neutral"

"I took a school trip to Disneyland Paris recently   i was very, very disappointed. Rides not working, huge queues, poor quality food.... I have taken trips there, sometimes twice a year, for the last ten years, and I am considering whether this was the last one. Some of our group went on two rides in 6 hours. I queued for two rides, only for them to break down after at least half and hour's waiting. And it's not cheap. Disney must do something. Shocking.","Negative"
"Wr do I start....... went to Disney 5 years ago with my 4 year old daughter and loved it, 3 parades a day one in each park and an allumination parade at nite it was spectacular so over whelming. Took my son 4 an daughter now 10 this week,    superhero    theme for the 25th anniversary and to my sons disappointment didn   t get to meet not one superhero as they are all by appointment only, never been so disappointed at anything in my life, one parade a day and it last 12 mins, the amount of money goin into that place Walt really needs to bring it back to life instead of an outdated commercialised money makin scam,    35 for 3 chips and 3 kids nuggets.... rides which u que for hours an last 3 mins max, not a Disney princess in sight and the ones in parade are still wearing dresses they wore 5 years ago and they look so grubby. The only good thing about the whole place is the fireworks.. Paid    50 for incredible suit an    25 for the doll and had to cause a scene in order to get my son to meet Mr & Mrs incredible because u have to book an appointment to meet them!! They didn   t mind takin my money for the suit thou......

Save your money an your time this is not fun!","Negative"
"It has some (by no means all) of the features of Disneyland but it's small and pokey really and disappointing if you've been to any of the US parks, Euro Disney or even Tokyo. To be honest I think this was just Disney marking time until the Shanghai park opened and I wouldn't be surprised to see it close once the bigger version on the mainland takes the tourists. It's not really Disney at its best.","Neutral"
"Hong Kong Disneyland is not as good as Tokyo Disneyland. Entrance is the same as any Disney but smaller and I think that Disney Paris is yet better than this. There are lots of tourist from China coming to Hong Kong Disneyland and they are really pushy and unmanned that they jump the cure but the Disney staff are not present to control the cure and I would blame the staff who does not do anything. I would skip Hong Kong Disney and choose Tokyo Disneyland anytime than getting stressed. ","Neutral"
"A bit disappointed this time actually. We got there for the opening and the guy at the gates who checked the bags was quite rude.No massive queues as the weather was hideous. One of the best rides (Indiana Jones) closed, technical issues with another ride and a number of boarded up areas. As one of the guests pointed out there are more places to eat than rides.","Neutral"
"On April 25th 28th 2016, my wife and I spent three days visiting the Disney Parks at Anaheim California. This was our first visit to Disneyland, we have visited the Orlando Disney Parks in three occasions.Most of our time was spent at Disneyland. We selected the time of our visit (after Easter and before Summer) on the assumption that it would be less crowded. Well, we could not have been more wrong. The crowds were enormous, and the lines and waiting times were very long, usually around 30 45 minutes. In many cases it was nearly impossible to move around the parks without bumping into people or nearly hitting some baby stroller.We used the fast passes whenever possible, but for some attractions, we had to wait in line for at least 30 minutes or more. Adding to our frustrations was that in several instances, after standing in line for 30 minutes or so, the attraction or ride suffered some sort of mechanical problem. This was exactly what happened to us on the Peter Pan ride. When we almost reached the end of the line, there was some sort of mechanical problem, and no one could tell us whether the ride could go back in operation. Because, of this, and because there was no easy exit from the line, we had to jump over barriers and ropes. This was difficult considering our ages.That sort of annoyance also happened at the Winnie the Pooh ride. A similar, and even more frustrating situation happened to us with the  Rollicking Roadsters  at the California Adventures Park. It took us three attempts to finally get on this ride which broke down twice.The Anaheim parks seem to be smaller than the Orlando ones, this perhaps adds to the crowded conditions we encountered. Also, Disneyland does not offer Meal Plans or on  line fast passes. I must also add that in all our visits to Orlando Parks we never encountered so many rides and attractions out of service or breaking down.Our recommendation is that if you want to enjoy the  Disney Magic , you should go to Orlando and during off season times. The parks are larger, they seem to be less crowded, and there are better services, more attractions, more conveniences, and lodgings options..We did little in terms of shopping at the parks or at Downtown Disney, but we were shocked by the high prices of food, drinks, souvenirs, etc. Perhaps there was a time when Disneyland was the  Happiest Place on Earth , but that seems to be long in the past.","Negative"
"lots to do and see for all the family. try and stay in a hotel in the park if you can as you get 2 extra hours in the morning in the park (I know that some rides aren't open) but those that are have huge queues later. Lots for small ones to enjoy Buzz light years lazer ride , Its a small world and Casey Junior to name a few, also enjoyed by us oldies.Space mountain and phantom manor for the more daring amongst us. Be prepared for lots of walking . Dont miss the Disney parade at 5.30 each day or the fabulous fireworks at 11pm. Shopping is another experience not to miss out on either. Plenty of places to eat but probably worth buying the meal package with your booking as individual meals work out very expensive.We stayed for 4 days and it wasnt enough time to see it all but enough for my poor legs. Meals in Disney hotels seemed very good.a great time was had by all.","Positive"
"We were so happy to not queue more than 2 minutes on any ride! It is looking & feeling tired but still magical and creates lasting memories. Disney dreams show is brilliant! Food options are awful for anyone who isn't a fan of junk food! Snack options need to be re thought in all snack shops.They NEED a pret a manger shop! All staff are excellent at each ride, cafe, shop or stand! Walt disney was a very clever man : )","Positive"
"After visiting the original Disney parks in the US and even Euro Disney in France, the HK version is a bit of a let down. The park is really small and has only one real exciting ride, Space Mountain. The rest is mainly food outlets and artificial 'sightseeing' rides. The staff is really rude and does not hesitate to grab you quite violently when you walk in the wrong way. Spending one day at this park, which only opens at 10am, is more than enough. This will also help travelers to avoid the overpriced Disney hotels and stay in downtown Hong Kong where much more exciting things are to be done.","Negative"
"Like much in America nowadays, the new rides are loud, obnoxious, and typical. The old school stuff is good, but this place has sold out to the almighty dollar. Lots of crowds, and unless you absolutely love Disney stuff, it has lost its luster.","Neutral"
"Be wary of quite a number of visitors who jump queue as well being very pushy. Hold your young children securely as they risk being pushed over by anxious adults who rush into out of certain attractions. Take extra care where you place your wallets and valuables.

"Travelled with my sons stagecoach for a special week of activities. Whilst the special activities were amazing experiences for my son, the same can't be said for anything else at Disneyland Paris. The staff are rude (unbelievably so   to the point that it ruined the experience for all 122 people on our trip), the queues are long, the food is expensive and there isn't enough to entertain anyone for more than 3 days.Great if travelling with reallllllly Young children but if your child is over 4 then I would highly recommend doing anything you can to save the small amount extra to go to Florida (3 nights cost   1700 in Paris   and we got through a tonne of spending money, 3 weeks in Florida cost   4500 and we spent very little in comparison when we were there. Day by day   Florida worked out sooooo much cheaper).Tip  Avoid the chez remy restaurant   I have never experience such a rip of meal and such poor service.Tip   take water bottles in to the park and fill up at water fountains to save a bit of cash.Tip  animagique is lovelyTip   if stopping at a Santa Fe, take some sandwich bags with you and pop a few in a bag when going to breakfast. stock up on some goodies to help sustain you mid morning. Croissants only fill you up for a short period and you'll find yourself hungry mid morning. A nice snack will help (we spotted that everyone does it on the first day and kicked ourselves for not being better prepared   so don't feel too bad)","Neutral"
"It has been 30 years since I have been to disneyland and it has changed so much. We travelled from Australia , my mum , 15 yr daughter and myself. We stayed 3 days and still missed things, I'm sure. Everyone is so helpful, happy and the place is so very clean. We didn't go on the big tides but certainly went on the tame one and loved them all, the crowds were good( we thought they we huge but they tell me it was quiet ) . One midnight g we had breakfast we the characters at one of the restuarants . The parade was amazing and certainly a must but u have to find a seat early otherwise u will have too stand or sit on the ground , fine but my mum couldn't sit on the ground . Late fireworks were wonderful, but I'm not really into them. But nice too see. Would love too go back again !","Positive"
"We visited Disneyland Park as a group of adults and teenagers and were very disappointed by the whole experience. It is very overpriced and over rated for what it turns out to be.There were far too many visitors in the Park which made it difficult to view the parades and as a consequence we had to queue for everything rides, toilets and 40 minutes for a cup of tea which is completely unacceptable. The Thunder Mountain Ride broke down whilst we were waiting and when it was back up and running we queued an hour and a half for a 5 min ride ridiculous! after that we gave up. There were no Disney characters walking around the Park but I understand that there are designated meeting points around the Park where you could meet them but with the crowds this would have proved an impossibility .We left feeling that we had well and truely fleeced.... Disney Magic....more like Disney nightmare...save yourselves the time money and effort and spend a day and evening in beautiful Paris instead .","Negative"
"Well, I'd say this Disneyland is better suited for kids. Perhaps young adults would find a few fun rides, but most aren't very thrilling and more to a ~magical~ cruise swirls merrygoround type of rides.Food are certainly pricey but to be expected.Make sure to visit different souvenir stores inside as they sell somewhat different items at each area.Tip: DON'T VISIT DURING PEAK SUMMER","Neutral"
"First the prosGood parade and night time illuminations are fantasticCons5 years since last visit yet no new rides only refrub of some existing ridesMagic hours do not work in this park   main rides all stay shut until 10am   very few rides open and one of those had broken down   use your magic hours in Studios.Daily breakdowns of rides   runaway train had multiple breakdowns every day   other breakdowns included Pirates, Hyper Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear, Snow White and Indiana Jones.Still had a good time because it is Disney, but Paris is starting to look like the unwanted off spring of the Disney stable.Piece of advice if travelling from UK with a child from another family. We were not questioned leaving the UK but were asked for a letter confirming we had permission (despite our daughter's friend being 16), when travelling back through UK border control. Luckily we had a letter and so no problems.","Neutral"
"I have been going to Disneyland Park since 1976. The changes have all been for the better. It is such a clean, nice family environment. The only downside I see is that it is becoming too expensive for a family with several children. Save your money, though. It is definitely worth the smile of a child.","Positive"
"I recently visited HK Disneyland for the second time in March 2017. A large percentage of the venues were  under maintenance . We were disappointed there were so few rides to go on and most importantly, they no longer have curry popcorn! I was shocked they had discontinued this, the curry popcorn was out of this world! We aren't so much into the characters anymore, but I can't recall seeing any characters walking around either. It hardly felt like Disneyland. Next trip to Hong Kong, we'll stick with Ocean Park.","Negative"
"I don't know where to start with this review. Firstly the cost of the tickets on the gate is EUR109 per adult, book online and with Attraction Tix and you'll pay   55 per adult   nearly half price!We arrived around 11am on Saturday 24th March and the ques to even get into the park was a nightmare. On man on a horse trying to direct everyone. You were herded towards and entrance and bags were checked before being herded towards either the Disneyland Paris park or Walt Disney Studio park.Once we were finally into the park we decided to try and head towards the back to go on some rides. We made it onto a small boat ride within 15 minutes which we didn't think was too bad. We should have gone next door to the little train ride straight away but we walked to Indian ride where we couldn't go on as little one was one cm too small. By now it was around mid day and after checking the app for wait times   everything was over 45 minutes wait. Some were already 90 minutes. We used the fast pass to get a ticket to return to Hyperspace mountain. We got the ticket around 12.30 and had to return between 3.35   4.05. When we returned we did walk straight on and was on the ride within 10 minutes.Everywhere you went, the lines were huge. To get candy floss we had to line up to purchase a ticket then line up again to collect the candy floss   this took over 30 minutes.The places to eat are all greasy fried food, no where healthy at all. There was also nowhere to fill up your water bottles so you had to line up and pay for a water. In the height of summer this could be very dangerous if you are dehydrated.Big Thunder Mountain was out for most of the day however we saw they were testing it and took a risk by standing in line and thankfully it paid off however we were still queuing for 30  minutes.There is no organisation for the shows and this resulted in a lot of crowding and the kids not being able to see a lot.The biggest issue here is the lack of staff. There was barely anyone around to help.Sadly we were caught up in the issues on Saturday night. We were locked in the restaurant for over three hours with two very scared children. It was disgusting the lack of information being provided and at one point we all had to climb under the tables and shied the children as there was rumours that a gunman was inside. You can not understand how terrifying this is. I have travelled so often and I have never been so scared in my life.I would never return to Disneyland Paris ever again due to everything mentioned in this review. This was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime for our children and it turned in to an absolute nightmare.","Negative"
"Last minute one day visit on New Years Day. Expected park to be at capacity, pleasantly surprised! Whole park decorated for the holidays, exceeded expectations.  Season of the Force  still in effect, Star Wars attractions awesome. We took advantage of the fast passes and only waited about 30min standby for rides like Matterhorn and Hyperspace Mountain. Scored last minute reservations at Big Thunder Ranch BBQ for lunch, had to do it before they close in a few weeks. Food was excellent and service stellar. Fireworks cancelled due to  high winds  but wasn't really windy. Paint the Night Parade is a must see, especially if you grew up with the Main Street Electrical Parade. Starbucks merch is a dream come true for Disney Sbux addicts. Excellent visit for a holiday weekend!","Positive"
"The timing was excellent due to the amount of people scheduled tp be there. But Disney seems to close down major attractions due to servicing of the equipment. However, the cost is still the same! The big let down was Pirates of the Carribean and the Matterhorn and others were closed. Others were closed or a day or two, which is doable since we wee there for 4 days. Beside there were many shut downs while we were waiting for or on rides. Something isn't totally right with the park. We had no issue at Disney World in Florida.","Neutral"
"Visited with my 13 year old daughter. The last time I visited was 14 years ago with my then 7 year old daughter. I must say that nothing has improved in that time, i expected the place to have modernised at least  installation of charging ports for example as techonology has advcanced and people now need their phones, tablets to do everything, including taking pictures, but I noted it was exactly the same as 14 years ago. Also, most people that work at the place did not understand a word of English. This is surprising considering that people visits from all over the world! My daughter and i spent a good part of 10 minutes trying to explain to the cashier staff about the pictures we wanted to buy at Mickey mouse stand as she could not understand us!All in all good but the place needs to improve and staff trained well to understand English.","Neutral"
"I recently went to Euro Disney Paris with the family. We decided it was probably our last family holiday together and that there was enough for two grown children and their parents to enjoy the time together as well enjoying time apart.The park itself although still true to Disney seemed to lack the magic it had the first time we went.Things are starting to look a bit tired and in need of some work.There were many of the bigger attractions closed for renovation which of course made other things busier than normal.As is usual with these places the food was awful, nothing was fresh and very very expensive.We stayed in the New York hotel which looked amazing on first glance but the rooms are looking a bit shabby, the pool really needs up dating and breakfast was a shambles.There seem to be far to many shops selling over priced Disney tat. The entire place is far to commercialised and the holiday feel has gone.Sad, so in answer to my heading......... no, unfortuneately I wouldn't go back","Neutral"
"First went nearly 10 years ago, and this time round, it seemed more geared to taking your money off you than to delivering an experience not to forget.Actually, that's unfair, the unforgettable experience was provided by the prices. We were charged 27 euros for 2 sandwiches (nothing fancy, just regular sandwiches in a triangular box   like you'd get at lunchtime in the UK), 2 small coffees (vending machine size cups   not Starbucks buckets), 1 small fries (I counted them   24 fries to be precise) and a 500ml bottle of coke. The food prices are outrageous.I liked DLP the first time I went, and wanted to go back again. I wouldn't ever return.","Negative"
"I am a Southern California grandmother who remembers going to Disneyland as a child and then later taking my son there when he was a child. Now I am able to take my grandchildren there. Unfortunately, I feel an obligation to tell people  especially people who pay lots of money for travel and accommodations   that Disneyland is not what it used to be. Disneyland is very expensive. And very crowded. And the rides don't always work. Last year, I paid over $550.00 to take my son and his family (7 people) to visit the happiest place on earth. We were pretty disappointed because many, many of the rides stopped working throughout the day. I remember the days when ride closures would be announced ahead of time, but these closures were intermittent and seemingly random. We would stand in line for awhile and then be told that the ride had to be taken down for maintenance. In addition, we sometimes had trouble finding a restroom that was open. Three times throughout the day, we were actually turned away from restrooms. For the price that we paid, I really expected more. We haven't been back since, and don't really have a desire to return in the near future. Please, if you are planning to travel a distance, book hotel rooms, and buy multi day tickets think carefully about whether or not you really want to spend all that money on something that is sadly not what it used to be.","Negative"
"This was not a patch on our Florida experiences. It was overwhelmed with visitors, and few of the  cast  members seemed to react with guests. They were also not all very efficient at getting people on and off rides, so queues were longer than necessary. It seems that they have forsaken the magic for making money   high admission price and then an exorbitant fee for a fast track ticket to enable you to ride more than half a dozen attractions in a day. It was noticeable that even with a fast track pass customers had to wait for up to 30 minutes to ride. There are just too many visitors allowed in, so the experience is limited, frustrating, and feels like a rip off. And the food and beverages were very expensive and, in our experience, not very good.All in all this was most disappointing. The Disney mantra is that the customer may not always be right, but he is still the customer. Disneyland Paris seems to live by the rule that the customer may not always be right but what does it matter   we are taking him for a whole lot of money.","Neutral"
"Our first Disneyland experience with our 3 year old daughter. We went on a weekday when the park was surposed to be quieter. When we arrived not long after 10am we meets large cues with only two thirds of the ticket office open. 45 minutes we waited to pay to get in. As you could tell by looking around most the girls going were wearing some kind of Frozen clothing and there was going to be a lot of interest in the Frozen village, one of the main reasons we were taking our daughter. After getting our bearings and reading the site map we had to fight for we headed to the Frozen village as there is a small amount of tickets for each show allocated on a first come basis. We arrived at 11.15am to be told all tickets had been given out so if we wanted to see the show and enter the village we would have stand and wait...you should get into the 2.30pm we were told, so they expect you to stand for 3 hours in the blazing sun with a 3 year old. We left to see some of the rest of the park and came back around 5pm to try to get one of the later shows...we still had to stand for nearly two hours but at least it was cooler then. The show was quite good as was meeting Olaf and the sleigh ride...but they closed the indoor snow village before we had chance to go play. There must be a better way to organise this..the rest of the park was quite good, we stayed to closing at 9pm but only managed to get on 8 rides and grab a quick burger in this time (10 hours)...you need a two day ticket if you want a chance to go on most of the rides...expensive for 8 rides and a short show...","Neutral"
"The park is very crowded and very difficult to find your way around  the printed maps and the App map are not clear enough and there are no signposts. The fact that you can get a free Fast Pass for certain attractions is very helpful.","Neutral"
"The only reason I came back to this park was because I had my dad with me and he had not been back since he was a kid. I had purchased two $130.00 3 day park hopper passes for myself and my dad (military salute passes) and we had wanted to visit both parks. After only spending half the day at the original park, we left frustrated. We took the tram from the parking lot and two employees (the driver and the guy at the back of the tram got into a massive argument while we were there waiting to be loaded onto the tram. Then we get to the actual park gate. I saw an attendant and asked her which gate was for the disabled she snapped back at me  they all are!  (it was the same crochety wench that told me last year that I could not use the disabled entrance. I am a disabled veteran.) We enjoyed visiting with the big 5 at the main gate and then rode a total of 4 rides. There were a few that allowed us to enter the handicapped entrance and it was appreciated. Then we went to Pirates. We were told that there were too many people that pretend they are handicapped and now Disney just gives fast passes (which means you still stand around 30 minutes after your designated time and are mixed in with able bodied people who have fast passes). The service and quality have gone down hill and dad was sorely disappointed in the park because it was so much better when he was a kid. It was not as crowded, and the people were friendlier. We won't even waste our time here next year. 90 minute wait times per ride is the norm. As the day progresses the crowds just get worse and worse. The poor crowd management creates a dangerous situation and prevents park goers from enjoying their experience because most of the day is spent in long lines. That was not what Mr.Disney envisioned and if he saw the conditions now he would be heart broken. We had a much better time at Universal and will become season pass holders at their park instead.","Negative"
"I have been to both American parks twice and had high hopes for Disney Paris. At first I was excited because the facilities look so immaculately Disney. However, as many people have pointed out the cast is rude, the service is slow, and the food is crap. My favorite aspect however was the shear number of rides that were not working or constantly malfunctioning. Examples: the Aerosmith coaster is closed, thunder mountain is closed today, pirates of the Caribbean is closed, the nautilus is closed, last night Pinocchio broke down twice so they ended up just shutting it down. While on the Toy Story space adventure ride it broke down on us no less than 4 times, it took 15 minutes to ride the ride ( we did rack up 220,000 points each while waiting for them to fix the ride). Armageddon was broken this morning, the tea cups are closed, you get the idea. Likely due to all the closed rides, the lines for the rides that are open are no less than 40 min, and the fast pass return times are several (2 3) hours out. That is of course if the fast pass scanners are working, take for example the Hollywood Hotel Tower, the line is 50 min long but the fast pass scanners are covered up so you can   t scan. I feel like if Disney can   t provide their major attractions to their paying customers to a degree such as this they should offer discounted tickets. I agree with another comment on this page that this park gives Disney a bad name. Other than the appearance nothing else represents the experiences we have at the U.S. parks.","Neutral"
"Over the easter weekend there were far too many closed attractions (maintenance and technical problems). The food is terrible for the price you pay. It's basically hamburgers in 10 different variations. When we got home after 4 days we were dying for a normal sandwich.","Neutral"
"Let me start by saying that I am a huge Disney fan who's dragged my family to Disneyland once (sometimes twice) a year for the last 25 years. Our last few visits have been okay, nothing stellar, but after our visit this year, I think I'm finally ready to hang up my Mickey ears. We visited the first week of June and were surprised to see that Space Mountain was down for refurbishment. Why wouldn't that take place during the off season? In addition, there were prolonged breakdowns of Indiana Jones, Big Thunder Mountain, and Splash Mountain during the ONE DAY we visited. So we headed over to California Adventure, only to find that California Screamin' and the new Radiator Springs Racers were also down for part of the day, and Grizzly River Run was closed for refurbishment. If I am now paying $150 for a one day park hopper ticket, I have some expectations that the rides will at least be working. With all the big rides down, everyone was funneled into the smaller rides, so lines were extremely long.We expected Disneyland to be crowded, but it was absolutely bursting at the seams, and every pathway was congested by 11:00 a.m. We had planned to stay and watch Fantasmic, but the crowds just became too much, and we left at 7:00 p.m. The overall cleanliness of the park left something to be desired as well, with dirty bathrooms the norm, and trash noticed along Main Street. The quality of the merchandise has gone downhill, too, as we found nothing worth purchasing in any of the stores. My daughter was particularly disappointed that there was absolutely no Olaf merchandise (from Frozen), which you think would have been everywhere. Overall, it was a disappointing trip, and the entire family concluded that we did not need to visit there again anytime soon.","Negative"

"I was very wary going to Disney in August. However my planning and research resulted in a fantastic visit. We bought one park one day tickets the cheapest. Got there when the gates opened for non Disney residents. Went straight to Fast track Apparently This year it can be done online. Indiana Jones ride first then Thunder Moutain Space Mountain before our fast pass at 9.30. Other people took advantage of meeting disney characters. Then fast passed our next ride . By 1pm we had been on all the major rides. Used the single rider for Matterhorn. Then came back in the evening to watch the fireworks a brilliant day and it was the hottest day of the year.

"We were here right before President's Day. Many of the major rides were closed for  refurbishment , and after standing in line for 40 minutes, the Indiana Jones ride broke down (we were given a fast pass to ride it later). Just disappointed that before a major weekend that so many rides were closed and that made for bigger lines at the other ones. Also, several years ago we had purchased no expiry park hopper passes at Disney World and were told we could use them at Disneyland (but if you bought at Disneyland, you could not use them at WDW). We had used them at Disneyland twice in the past. Imagine our surprise when we went into the park entrance line and were told they had changed their policy, and those passes were no longer valid. After much consternation (and two very sad looking children), we did finally get some help from a person who would allow us this once to use them   a big shout out to her for doing the right thing!","Neutral"

"I go to Disneyland on average once a year & this was probably my worst experience. Many of the cast members I talked to were friendly, & the crowds (extremely large for a Monday, probably due to the first day of summer for a lot of people yesterday) are something I can't control, but my biggest complaint was the rides.If I'm going to pay $90  for a ticket now, can you at least make sure the rides have regularly scheduled maintenance instead of compromising guest safety & happiness by only fixing them when they break down in the middle of the day!! We waited 40min appx. for Indiana Jones for instance then had to wait another 15min because the ride broke down. This was the story for at least half the rides we tried to go on they did honor our fast passes (as they should've).On top of that, I understand that Disneyland by default is expensive for food & souveneirs, but when you're charging $7.00  for ONE slice of pizza that is ridiculous!Overall very frustrating this time around, but hey, as long as thousands of people pour into the park every day, Disneyland will continue to employ these outrageous business tactics.","Negative"
"I traveled with young teens to celebrate new year. We went via coach innovations that was a wowcher deal. On arrival at the park at 9am after a four hour drive from Calais we thought we would be able to get a breakfast or something decent to eat. Wrong !!! Coffee and muffins were all that was available. We knew it would be busy but didn't expect the crowds we did. A fair few of the larger attractions were broken and out of order. Other rides were up to two hour queuing time. The parks do not cater food outlets for the intake of people. And the choice is stale burgers and fries which is cooked and sat under heat lamps costing 13 euro!!! A small cup of coffee is 2.50 euro. There were a few restaurants but you had to book which we didn't know about. It's really showing signs of wear and tare and old looking. Cracked pavements flaking paint etc. The parades were worth watching. And the only thing you didn't have to que for although the crowds were 10 and more people deep. I made the habit of comparing our visit to one we made to Florida a few years ago. Which to be honest I would say save and go there instead. I was really let down as you expect the whole disney thing to be more magical. The minimal staff that you see floating about are rude and can't be bothered talking to you. The fire work display at nite was average nothing spectacular. Only when I returned did I find out how much debt the parks in Paris are.","Negative"
"We have just visited Disneyland Anaheim. And to put my feedback into context my family and I are avid Disney fans and have visited Walt Disney World and Disneyland Paris on many occasions. I have to say that Disneyland Anaheim lacks the magic of Walt Disneyland World in Orlando. The owners of the park have tried to cram too much into the park. OK it was built in 1955 and there is limited real estate in Anaheim. However, having crammed in too many rides and attractions it feels really claustrophobic. There were too many people in the park which exacerbated the problem (and I think was actually quite dangerous.) The staff in both parks are not as friendly as they are in Florida. Getting into the park is a nightmare. They don't have a separate security entrance for people NOT carrying bags. This results in major queues before you have even gone through the ticket entrance. And when you do go through the ticket barrier you will be asked for ID   which is a real pain as it means you will need to take a passport or drivers licence or credit card   important stuff that could be lost in the park! Food is much pricier in Disneyland Anaheim compared with Orlando. For example, ice cream is almost twice the price!! And as for the on site Disney hotels   they are extortionately priced. You will get much better value for money at Orlando (and even Paris) which I can vouch for given that we always stay at Disney hotels when we visit Orlando or Paris. My wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and we had informed Disney when we made our booking. Orlando has a nice touch were you get a little treat (cake) at the end of your reserved table meal   not so at Disneyland. Finally a few tips. We stayed at the Marriott Anaheim (a fantastic hotel I would thoroughly recommend). Use the shuttle bus to get to from the park. It's $12 per adult for a 3 day pass and is well worth the money. Also, to avoid leaving your bags at reception and then not being able to chill out before you leave for the airport, ask the hotel if you can keep the room after check out time. We did   the whole afternoon cost me just $60, which allowed us the use the pool in the afternoon and then have a shower in the room before leaving for the airport. Excellent value for money.So will I return to California   absolutely yes. Will I return the Disneyland Annaheim   sadly no!","Neutral"
"Just returned from a mini break with my husband and I have to say our stay was all we wished it to be and more...absolutely loved the park and how it was all very christmassy.. It truly was magical... As for dreams.. There's really no words to describe it.. Other than AMAZING!! ","Positive"
"I visited this place with less expectations.. and i did righti It has lot of offerings for kids, but very less for age of 30's. You may like few thrilling rides along with a good company.But vegetarian guys just be ready for fasting, since hardly you will get there something to eat.Anyways still there is something that you can enjoy.","Neutral"
"I'm sure Disneyland would have been awesome   if 4 rides we would have loved weren't closed for maintenance! Closed rides were the Pirates of the Carribean, the Star Wars ride, the cars ride and Space Mountain which doesn't leave very many good ones! And because of all those good rides closing, it pushed the lines for the other rides to about a 20 50 minute wait which is not expected for a weekday in the winter. A bit cheeky to charge full price for tickets when so many rides are closed. It's all on the Disneyland website so just make sure you check it out before you go!","Neutral"
"I visited Hongkong Disneyland several weeks ago, but since my kids are below 4 years, I thought it's not worth to get in. So, we planned to visit but not buying tickets for entrance.Ok, we arrived at the station that connected with train to the park. Well, the train tickets costs quite a lot, around 28 HKD maybe I do not really remember. How we love to be in that train which all about Mickey, the window shape, the hand holder, and there are Disney's characters statue too on every corner of the compartment. We started to feel so Disney. We reached the station, still felt so Disney because within several steps we easily reached the welcome gate with Mickey statue on it.... Strolling along the way, and we reached a big fountain with whale and again Mickey on it, still excited and felt so Disney, until my eyes reached the sight of crowds, which was the mass of people queueing at the ticket gate... Our Disney feeling dropped drastically!  Is that all?  we asked each other... Come on, don't wish for Mickey and friends to get out, we cannot even see the castle or anything. And almost no food stalls around outside the ticket gate. That was real just it!If I knew it before, I wouldn't go out of the train station to save my Octopus balance...","Neutral"

"The park looks like a building site at the moment with whole areas closed, thunder mountain , adventure island. There was a crane at the back of the castle and builders fencing all around it and other parts of Fantasyland.This was my 4th time to visit Disneyland and it was my worst experience, apart from the building works many of the attractions closed temporarily with no notice for technical issues.","Neutral"
"This place is heaven on earth of little kids and little kids at heart! I could visit here everyday as the feeling of magic just washes over you the minute you go in the door. It has the most amazing atmospheres and shows and this is before you even start on the rides. Worth every penny and an experience you will never forget!","Positive"
"I grew up visiting Disneyland in the 80's, once per year, every summer age 4 12. It was magical. You never knew what character you might happen upon! I remember using ticket coupons and then it was open admission. The best chance of catching all the rides was to wait for the electric light parade at night and ride the rides during the parade. I tried to hold onto this with my family this time around but ultimately what we will remember of our visit is the LINES and the CROWDS. Show up an hour before the gate opens? You have a line a 1 4 mile long. They let you through the bag check only to put you in line to get you into the park and then wait in line again. It's a gigantic crowd control experience. They let SO many people into the park   I've heard upwards of 80,000 people per day? It feels like it... lines for everything. Dole whip? Line... Ice cream? Line. Princess or character? Line. Bathroom break? Line. Fast pass... just keeps you running around the park thinking you are entertained. You might be lucky to ride 5 8 rides per day. Break that into hours spent in the park. 12 hours they are open on a weekday, you will ride a ride for 35 40 minutes total out of 12 hours. I love Disneyland of the past. I don't think I'll go back, ever. It's too commercial. It's far too crowded. It's a very expensive trip. I can only hope my kids still believe in the magic but for me... I'm sorry, the magic is gone. If you do go.. rent a stroller for kids under 6. Bring your own water snacks. Plan dinner and don't miss the best hours of rides between 5 9. Go back to the hotel and swim and rest during the heat of the day.","Negative"
"Who doesn't love this place. Queues were long on the day we went but we got on all the rides we wanted . Lots to see and do. Only negative was the haunted mansion was still closed and had been last time we visited in 2012. Overall everything you wanted it to be. ","Neutral"

"I went to Disneyland on 10 13 2018. I am not new to Disney, I have been to Disneyland at least 10 times, Disney World 6, and to the Aulani Resort once. Let's start with the drive in, ... waited in line for 40 min to park.... from parking it is a walk to the tram which we had to wait 3 trams before arriving at the park. We already had tickets but the line to get in with tickets was about 15 minutes. It was so crowded that there were 2 3 hrs waits for most attractions. Fastpass was either not available or available during the 11pm 12am slot. There were three extremely rude Disney staff there. I had NEVER experienced that. One staff was yelling so loudly in the restroom the bday girl had to hold her ears and looked terrified. Three kiddos between the ages of 5 9 (one bday girl age 5) were unable to do more than 4 attractions in 10 hours. Navigating through the park was like driving on the 405 during bad traffic. It was not only crowded, it was like a can of sardines. Awful, never experienced this before and if there are many days like this now in the park, there will eventually be less customers. When the day is so overcrowded ....as this day was, admissions should be limited so some enjoyment can be had from families spending  magical  funds. No so. cal discount, no one day discounts. AWFUL. Disney is does NOT provide the  mgic  and happiness it once did. :(","Negative"
"I grew up in the U.S. but now live in Hong Kong and was excited to see what this theme park is all about. Granted, it's Disney but for the size and price I don't really think it's worth it. I'd go for Ocean Park over this any day. Best time of year to visit would definitely be in the fall or winter and not the hot summer. I would suggest paying extra to get the fast pass at certain rides. Totally worth it and it tells you when to come back for no lines waiting! Of course it is going to be pricey because everything at Disney is.  Have an umbrella (weather can change immediately) sunscreen, hat, sunglasses stay hydrated wear comfortable shoes check to see what time park is open until (the day we arrived it was closing early for a special event!)","Neutral"
"Lots of mainland tourists , even locals jumping queue,shouting,pushing. Screaming kids, total mayhem. Totally bad behavior exhibited by them.

If u really want the magical experience, go Japan.","Negative"
"Same lay out as all of the other parks I've visited (Hong Kong, Orlando) so easy to navigate around the food was limited and vastly over priced the queuing for the princesses was excessive with lots of unhelpful staff working to rule on time schedules that were unrealistic.most queues for rides were not too bad, but it was late July and raining so most people stayed away.","Neutral"
"As I child I went to the Disney World in Florida and it was one of the most magical things I can ever remember. So on our way to a French holiday with relatives, we booked 2 nights (at the Vienna Magic Circus which was fab but different review) and a 1 day 2 park pass. Our boys (6 and 4) first visit we were so excited and we had a loose plan of what we wanted to do especially with height restrictions. Few days before noticed a lot was closed like Peter Pan and Space Mountain, disappointed but already booked so not much we could do and we had never been before so didn't realise how bad this would be until there. We hit the Studio park first and the rides that were open like Ratatouille waited 55mins with a 4yr old already doing so well but hadn't even got on and were evacuated off as it had broken down. Went straight to Crush Coaster and after 20mins same thing happened it broken down. We headed to Toy Story Parachute and Hollywood Tower but there were over 90mins waits because there was nothing else running so everyone was hitting them. Advertised as a midi day (a May Friday not in school hols) but couldn't see how they could have got ANY more people in the parks and it was 25C so even getting a bottle of water was a mission and more queing. We went over to the Disney park hoping to at least see some characters but unlike my friend said a few months ago they are not walking about anymore it's a ... You guessed it, Que system at least 55mins alll day to see Mickey. So by now it's 1pm and the boys have done NOTHING, except que but been on no rides or seen any characters! My 6yr old just broke down I actually have a video of him saying  Disneyland isn't as fun as I thought  it was heartbreaking. We ended up going on 3 small rides like Small world and the Tea cups (can pay   1.50 at our local fun fayre to do) and watched the parade but all we did the whole day was que in boiling sun and ply the kids out of guilt with ice creams, treats and hot dogs (4 plain hot dogs, 2 bottles of water and a Coke 41E and a 30mins wait!!) more money in Disney's pocket though as you're trapped... very clever. We were told it was open until 10pm so after the parade Bee lined for the studio again to try Ratatouille but that park closes at 6pm!! No one mentioned this. I had tried to get fast passes but all gone and we spoke to a few who had got them for Ratatouille but they couldn't use them as it was broken down anyway, I did complain as we left but they didn't want to know. We gave up then, boys could barley speak from exhaustion and they had spied Planet Hollywood in the village which we then bigged up as  Pizza planet  from Toy story as they didn't get to see Buzz and Woody as hoped. Again 35min wait for a table then over an hour for our food, even the waiter was apologising. 100E for greasy pizza and a few drinks. Totally devastated for my boys feel I totally let them down by building up so much doing big reveal bags with outfits etc WOULD NOT return, total rip off.","Negative"
"We went to Disneyland for my niece's 5th Birthday celebration and we had an amazing time. The park is so much fun and well organized. There was so much to see and do. The shows were just spectacular. I loved watching my Niece get excited over the rides and the characters. I can't wait to do this trip again next year.","Positive"
"My day wasn't lucky enough. But what is more important...my daughter is happy after all. That was her birthday present. Summer time even week day is very busy.Queue around 50 min you have to wait! And the worst on the end RAIN. Can break everything. I wasn't able go to another park time fly so fast.","Neutral"
"Came here for my triplet girls 16 birthday as a special treat.  Sorry to say that this is not a patch on Florida.  Here are the low lights   Too small   No magic   No characters wondering around   Few staff around except on rides   Loads of Rides...More","Negative"
"As I told before   queuing kills. Use fast pass machines. Take drinks and snacks with you. Be sure to have a comfortable shoes since you would have to walk a lot. Many attrations are guided in french, it is okay, but your english speaking children do not understand a thing.","Positive"
"Worst experience i have ever had Badly organised rude people pushing and shoving, cues to big for food language barrier a huge problem..........Been to paris city most beautiful place.....avoid Disney......Been to Disney Florida the grand master of theme parks........My advice is go to PortAventura in spain.....Great people, great weather, great rides, good prices and only 1.5 hours from stansted to reus airport then 10 min taxi ride to park........","Negative"
"I can't understand how anyone can give this place a good review. It is so overcrowded with lots of rides out of action. There is no atmosphere, no Disney magic, no characters walking around. It was such a disappointment. The French also seem to lack awareness of personal space and are constantly banging into your back as you queue, even when the queue isn't moving. Queue jumping and letting their kids run riot also seems to be perfectly acceptable. As is mowing you down with their buggies and barging you out the way   whether you are an adult or a child. As others have mentioned, smoking is rife all over the park. The security guards with dogs also let their dogs crap on the pavement and don't bother to clear it up. You will spend your whole time queueing Queuing for underwhelming 30 second ridesQueueing for a vile coffee or disgusting junk foodQueueing for the unsanitary toilets You get my point. Don't buy into the hype. Spend your money on something else worthwhile.","Negative"
"Had a great time in the park. Unfortunately, smokers took some of the delight away. Disney says the parks are nonsmoking on the ticket, but they don't enforce it. Shame.","Neutral"
"The 2 biggest rides in DLP are Thunder Mountain & Space Mountain. Both closed for renovation repairs at the same time. Nice planning Disney!! Everywhere in the park seemed to be having some kind of repair or renovation   this was June 2016, not exactly the low season. Huge areas around Thunder Mountain were boarded up causing big detours in getting from A B. Lots of food outlets were closed meaning big queues at the ones that were open. What staff there were didn't seem to have a clue and were very slow. The ice cream outlet for Ben & Jerry's was a disaster! 1 person serving, taking money & preparing the ice creams. If anyone wanted a crepe & ice cream, the guy had to spend several minutes making the crepe leaving everyone standing there. In other places, 2 queues only had 1 cashier alternating between the queues. Another food outlet where I queued for 20 minutes suddenly announced that their kitchen was broken??????? How do you break a kitchen?Food is hideously expensive and very repetative. We found Earl of Sandwich the best value in the Disney Village with more choice than anywhere else and better prices.","Neutral"
"It's Disneyland.  The happiest place on earth.  I really enjoyed the new Indiana Jones ride.","Positive"
"My favorite was the Ocean Park, but he was very disappointing and the Disneyland was much better as expected!Main Street USA, Toy Story Land and Mystic Point have nothing for couples and also no good dining options. This three places in Disneyland had us disappointed and since the price of admission was sorely high, so I only can give 3 stars.At some places at Disneyland you can eat very well. Particularly pleasing were the many drink stalls, in view of the very great heat in HK (at our visit time)The  Jungle River Cruise  in the Adventureland was the best!!","Neutral"
"This is the 2nd time I've been to Hongkong Disneyland. 1st time was in 2007.Not much changes except for some new rides. A new garden is in the making (yet to open).Typical kiddy rides. Its more fun when there's a kid around.2 rides that's more fun in my opinion: Space mountain and Parachute.The crowd is atrocious. Too many people in the theme park. Can forget about photo taking with Disney characters. The queue is very long too. Conclusion: Visit HK disneyland once will do. Even after 8 years to revisit, there's no surprise element in the themepark.","Neutral"
"We never tire of coming to Disneyland! We used to come at least twice every year when the kids were younger and so it's been about 4 years since the last time we were here. The place remains magical    the new parades, especially Paint the Night, were dazzling. The Star Wars transformation (sort of) of Tomorrowland was exciting. The rides are all still fun and made us want to go back again and again.","Positive"
"This was not our first trip to Hong Kong Disneyland and our main purpose was not just to visit Toyland but since it was there, we had a peek to see what the fuss was about. Compared to the  original  sections of HKD, this new section was a major disappointment. Most of the rides are designed for older kids and adults so no joy for toddlers here, unless your tots are adrenaline junkies. Don't waste your time, stick with the older parts (which we did on our 2nd day) and have a blast there (and we did)! To sum it up   if you are going to HKD just for Toyland, think twice.","Negative"
"We were lucky to be there for day one of the Christmas parade and  celebration!","Positive"
"Perhaps visiting on a halloween special day affected this but after visiting Disneyworld in Florida a few times I was excited to try the California park. I was disappointed. Everything was cramped, the way the queues were set up was bizarre, with Matterhorn in particular just sending us round in circles trying to find the end of the queue! A lot of the big rides weren't even working.The staff seemed bored and uninterested, whereas at Disneyworld they are very much actors in character and not staff   that difference was very obvious.We visited Califonria Adventure next door too which was much better   save your money and just visit there instead.","Negative"
"As if you love Disney Movie definitely Disneyland will be one of your top destination. Hong Kong Disneyland is quite small but well enough to feel the magical world. Most of the rides are very gentle means only good for kids and people who don't like thrill rides.A great place to take photos since they have few themes on every area as Disneyland always do but too bad their castle not 100% real because some part only a picture so it wasn't really amusing at all for me. And for better deal you can actually check KLOOK apps to get cheaper ticket for Disneyland.","Neutral"
"We entered Disneyland at 1pm. The sad thing is they closed all outdoor rides at 1:30 pm. Well they should have informed us before we bought the tickets. We went to Hongkong just to go to Disneyland. The tickets cost us more than 10k pesos (1617 HKD). They already know they're gonna close based on the forecast and yet they still let us buy the tickets. We only stayed inside for an hour or so. We just took pictures and rode the hyperspace mountain and took off. Bad experience. They only want the money... and didnt care if we lose it. ","Negative"
"It's Disneyland, what else can I say?  It's every kids dream and it's good for adults too. There are many little know features of the park.  Ask a DL fanatic and they'll give you the inside scoop.","Positive"
"I'd been to  EuroDisney  3 or 4 times, but the last time was 10 years ago. We decided to return in 2013 with our two boys, aged 6 and 4. We went the first week of September, and the French schools had just gone back, so not as busy as it would have been earlier in the summer. The longest queue we had was 1 hour for Crush's Coaster, but other than that the longest we waited in line was about 30 mins.A couple of things: If you can, I'd recommend going for at least two full days. We had 4 days and easily filled them all (with one day spent in the Studios park) and this really took the pressure off of having to get everything done in 1 2 days, which you will struggle to do unless it's a very quiet time of year.Also, do a little planning, even if it's just noting which rides and things you REALLY want to do. Then focus on getting those done, either by getting to them first thing or last thing in the day when it's quieter, or using fast pass, or just biting the bullet and queuing up for it but at a time you're prepared to queue!Other than being there longer, the best thing you can do is get there EARLY! If you're staying in a Disney hotel, the Magic Hours (getting in at 8am) is worth doing, even just once, to get on a few Discovery Fantasyland rides with little or no queues. We did the Buzz Lightyear ride about 4 times back to back with no queues at all, also Space Mountain and Orbitron all in under an hour first thing, then were first in the queue for Star Tours when it opened at 10. Again, it takes the pressure off getting to those rides when the park is busier later on.Use the Fast Pass system. It does work fine. Sometimes the FP time is later in the day, but it's worth doing, especially on busier days. Our kids understood if we got a fast pass we could come back later and walk on, which helped steer them away from getting into longer queues.One for people with kids   We messed up our times and kept missing the kids normal meal times. We didn't realise we'd done this and didn't understand why they were going crazy! But when you're in the park normal life routine doesn't apply :) So make sure you feed the kids at their normal meal times, it'll help them cope with the excitement and tiredness.You will get worn out... we did 10 13 hour days all 4 days we were there... so try and take a break now and then :) Take water bottles and re fill them for free (water stations are by all toilet areas). Food is expensive, so prepare. Either budget to spend the money (use DLRP Magic website for menu examples) or take food in with you. We did a bit of both and it worked ok. The Free Half Board deal worked well for us and encouraged us to sit down for a proper meal for an hour, which is a great chance for a rest!Remember to enjoy it :) Yes, some people don't queue properly... but don't let it ruin your time there. Rise above it and look around at the amazing place you're in!Have fun... we'll be back again in a couple of years.","Positive"
"Matterhorn was shut down for refurbishment that will take almost as long as building the Empire State Building. Alot of people and waiting and the food there is not good. We went to bakery and they would not warm up our croissant nor could we get a breakfast sandwich. Coffee there is no good. But it was nice to see the Place that Walt built, but he would not approve on the greed. Every ride ends up at a gift shop filled with Chinese made crap. Can Disney afford to have things made here?","Neutral"
"We went on a Saturday in October, the only day we had free to go. It was so packed we could hardly move, wait times for the popular rides were two hours long, FastPass distribution closed early, we went back to Splash Mountain in our return window to use the one FastPass we did get only to find the ride was closed due to mechanical issues (we did finally get on later), traffic was herded one way after shows meaning even if you hadn't watched a show you had to go that one way which was usually the opposite direction you were trying to go to get to a ride, AND, we didn't see any characters walking around   we even dedicated time to go to Toontown only to find there were 75 minute waits to meet Mickey and Minnie. My 12 year old niece left Disneyland disappointed with an empty autograph book she had bought with her own money. Overall the experience was not enjoyable and was a letdown. We had traveled all the way from Canada with an unfavorable exchange rate just to be stuck in crowds and herded like cattle. Disneyland lets way too many people in, to the point guests hardly get to see and do what they were excited for. Walt would be aghast, haha!We did finally get on some of the rides we wanted to late at night, and they were fun and slightly redeemed the park's image. That is the only reason I'm giving Disneyland a three instead of a two.","Neutral"
"If you have kids then you would definately enjoy .. but youngsters or couples won't enjoy at all . Except 2 3 rides all other rides are for kids .. not worth spending so much on kids rides when you don't have them.","Neutral"
"Having been going to Disneyworld Florida since 1982 this was our first visit here.Pleasantly surprised, thought it would be smaller and though not as big as the Florida park there was plenty to do.Got there for rope drop on a gorgeous morning and got most things seen by lunch time when the park started to fill up","Positive"
"Just back from euro Disney 6 adults and 2 kids, 11 and 2. We all had the same opinion that it was a very expensive waste of money. We paid extra to get the fast track tickets. We found these to be a waste of time and only used it once. The studio side of the parks were not even taking the fast track tickets. The 2 rides which we wanted to go on were out of order. There are numerous gift shops on every corner all selling exactly the same over priced items. We will not be returning.","Negative"
"Thank You So Much for a wonderful visit. I wish you would be Test Track to California Adventure. Would bring more people!!","Positive"
"When living dreams and making memories it doesn't get any better than this! The crowds are bad but that's what you get with something good.","Positive"
"We had an amazing day despite the awful weather. Smaller than the Parks in the USA but no less enjoyable.The only negative is that the younger staff are clearly not as well trained. I witnessed staff being rude to third parties on a number of occasions. One girl pushed an innocent third party as she rushed to make a phone call. Another lady was actually loudly aggressive to the children climbing on the pirate ship when they ignored her colleague, one parent gently advised her that she was correct but please calm her tone. She retorted,  if they do not listen to her, then they will listen to me .I wonder if my experience would have been different if we had brought children as they were merely tolerated by many of the people working there! In short, the experience would have been excellent only for the attitude of some staff members","Neutral"
"What more superlatives are there to add about Disneyland? The Magic Kingdom is magical; a living fantasy land where everything is near perfect. There are two parks both of which are incredible. The attention to detail of the designers is beyond equal. Every part of the parks is scenic; there are no sheds or modern buildings housing rides. Merchandising is everywhere but discreetly disguised as old fashioned shops,cafes, etc. Disneyland, and this is the original, is smaller than Walt Disney World in Florida but it still takes a day to do each park and doesn't lack anything. Disney characters wander around and there are lots of photo opportunities. A must do when in this part of the world.","Positive"
"It was my first time to Disneyland and I guess my expectations were too high (I've been to Disney World five times). I thought the park was in sore need of a refreshing (at nearly $100 a head, I know they have enough money to afford the supplies). The paint seemed shabby and a lot of rust was showing on the ride fencing. Also, I did not feel the vaulted Disney friendliness from the staff like I do in Florida. Maybe this was due to Disneyland seeming more like a regular theme park instead of an  experience  like Disney World but come on! If I wanted a regular theme park, I could have gone to any Great Adventures. Since I was there with my daughter (3y.o.), I didn't get a chance to ride several rides but I could tell that the lines weren't long. The food was typical theme park quality and mediocre at best (why can't they do a hot dog like Costco!). I won't make an effort to return.","Neutral"
"Once again, we spent a full day at Disneyland. It is pleasing that Paris has two amazing attractions   Disneyland and Eiffel Tower. Both provide an excellent experience.As in past, the visit was completely fun and memorable. The park provides many rides (some new ones like Toy Story and Cars related...).Even though it was a weekday, there were long queses as usual (wherein one has to wait for 30 45 minutes per ride).","Positive"
"I have been fortunate enough to visit the Disney world in the USA.... And as much as I enjoyed my time at Disneyland Paris, it was under whelming compared to the US parks. The crowds were massive and lines are extremely long... The children have to wait up to 3 hours just to meet a character!! This shocked me as I remembered characters roaming around the park and greeting guests all over the show in the US. The one must do, is the fire work display at the closing time of the park. It is a must see. Even if you visit just for that, try get as close to the castle as possible.","Neutral"
"We have been visiting Disneyland every year since our son was three years old. He is twenty now. We have always gone in the fall but the last few years have been continually disappointing to us. Finding October and November to be so crowded presumably because of the holiday decorations we decided to go in September. Our first day was pretty good as it was a Thursday but the rest of the weekend was terrible. Two hour wait lines and many rides broken down. We have to pay to fly down, pay for a hotel and then only get on a few rides or to wait in line to have it break down as we finally approached the entry. Its an expensive trip for us. Just not what it used to be. We still love it but are perplexed as to when to go as it seems the crowds are always beyond terrible these days. Even the Dole Whip line was over 30 minutes. Kind of a bummer for us. And why do they decorate early? They used to not have the Christmas decorations up until after Thanksgiving. Now its before.","Negative"
"I have lived in Florida for ten years so I am very very familar with all things Disney. Disneyland has many nice features and I loved seeing It's a Small World outside! That was nice. But there were not enough  castmembers  around and the ones that were working were not friendly like at WDW. It was a let down that the  castmembers  were not as nice and did not really care about what they were doing. In fact while we were there an employee put two dry ice packed bottles in a trash can and ice cream cart in toontown which exploded and were scary! The other issue was again service related when we ate at the mexican resturant in frontier land. The workers were uninterested in helping guests try and deciher the menu and then after someone would stand in line for 15 minutes they would say things like oh you need to stand in the other line. Making you wait another 15 minutes. If a  castmember  could have stood there and directed people it would have made lunch a more pleasant experience. Overall the rides were nice and all disney. Loved Mr. Toads Wild Ride, and Space Mountain like it should be in the DARK!!!! But the downer was the people working there. Even in the stores on Main Street. You would ask for help and they would say oh we do not have that and five minutes later you would find it....","Positive"
"HK Disneyland has a relatively small amount of rides compared to other amusement parks. It will be amusing for children till the age of 12 maybe, but teenagers will not find it fun. Most you will need to spend is around 3 hours at the park.","Negative"
"Went here in January for a day trip with my friend. We love theme parks and last year had done all USA Disney parks so wanted to add Paris to our ever growing list of parks. We had high hopes of this being as magical and overwhelming as other Disney parks.... God was we wrong yes it has the rides and has the castle but it just has no magic. Unhelpful and moody cast members. Areas where run down and incredibly tatty. Food was so basic and soo over priced I mean    16 for a basic small burger and soggy chips... Again magic people where is it. Also you policy on disabled people is different to USA this should have been informed to us as it wasn't and    20 to park in a car park that we are only there because we are paying to visit your park........ I can imagine is Walt Disney was around now he would be incredibly disappointed and ashamed of how his name is being used at this park.Fireworks where ok. But again lacked the size and imagination I would expect of a Disney park. ","Negative"
"i was hesitant to visit DLP because of all the bad reviews but i went anyway because we are huge disney fans. i have been to the one in orlando and california so i knew to lower my expectations here. i think it's cool to visit all the parks just once if you are a huge disney fan. the last one on my list is now disney tokyo. first off, getting the metro there was a headache. we didn't know you needed a special ticket to get to DLP. the map appears as though you take the red A line  A2 . but the A line splits into  A2  and  A4  which is confusing because the trains are not marked like here in NYC. you have to look at a monitor to see when your train is coming. it took us a long while to figure this out. we went to the info window and got an unlimited day pass. then she told us the pass would not take us to DLP and the round trip ticket just to go to DLP was 23 euros for 2 ppl. it felt like she was ripping us off as i did not understand why the regular 1.60 euro pass would not take us there. but when we got there we noticed that some ppl who did not have the  DLP  pass could not swipe their ticket to pass the turnstyle into DLP.ok, fine, but when we got back to central paris, we asked another ticket guy if our DLP pass would take us back to the hotel and he said no but we could have gotten a  DLP   unlimited  pass for only 1 euro more. but the lady that sold it to us did not mention this and therefore screwed us because then we had to buy more 1.60 metro passes to drop by the effel tower, the arc, and back to the hotel.then to top it all off, i had bought the internet passes online for a great price and left them at the hotel! arghhh!!! i am usually the most responsible person ever but with all the chaos and trying to lighten my bag for sightseeing and not following my original itenerary, things happen. thank goodness i have the most wonderful husband in the world and he was really understanding about it. i was so upset because these passes were non refundable and only good for 30 days. so we had to buy new, more expensive tickets when we got to DLP. this will never happen to me again! instead of keeping my online tickets on the 81 2 X 11 sheet with all my other stuff, i am cutting it out and putting it my wallet from now on. you guys should learn from my mistake and do this too! ok, well the disneyland park was not bad. we went to  it's a small world . the animatronics felt very cheap. and space mountain was very jerky and uncomfortable. then we went to walt disney studios, which was awesome! tower of terror was the best ride ever! the armagedden and stunt show spectacular were A  and i believe they are exclusive attractions to DLP as i have never seen them in cali or FL. the food was not as bad as everyone describes. the coke is 2.50 euros, which is cheap compared to the 4.50 euro drink at the effel tower. the disney meal was either a cheeseburger or chicken with fries and you got a dessert like chocolate cake or chocolate brioche and a drink for like 15 20 euros. can't remember exactly but you get a LOT of food. the workers were nice. i wasn't put off by anyone in particular. i didn't leave with any negative image of any of the workers. they were ok, nothing to complain about. bathroom were also ok. don't remember being totally grossed out. there was an attendant in there and also plenty of stalls to accommodate. the parades were ok too. quality is lower than orlando of course but still fun. the best part was sounvenier shopping. getting all the disneyland paris stuff with mickey and the effel tower. now here's the REAL reason why i came to DLP   lol!overall, it was one of the highlights of my trip to paris. a nice break from all the touristy sites of central paris. it was nice to visit once but i don't think i would go again. definitely go to orlando if you have the disney bug. i would recommend it if you are a disney fan and want to visit all the disneyland parks in the world.","Positive"
"It was somehow special to spend time in the very first theme park created by Disney himself.Atmosphere is peaceful though very enjoyable. Not so many lines though it was pretty crowded.My kid aged 8 was able to enjoy all the rides, which was great ! Especially the Hyperspace Mountain.Night show and fireworks were amazing. Food is decent and good price for that kind of activity. Staff was so friendly !A great experiance, even under a rainy sky !","Positive"
"My 4.75 year old and I visited HK Disneyland during Chinese school holidays which meant it was hot, humid and crowded. Average wait time for rides was close to 1 hour which is a big ask for a little person. When we did get in (had some problems with the vouchers I purchased through Expedia) the Customer Relations gave us some  Fast Passes  for a few rides. This was definitely the way to go because it meant we only had to wait about 10 15 minutes for the rides (Buzz Lightyear & Pooh Bear). A good tip is also to go on the rides as a 'single' because it's about 1 4 the wait time compared to going in a group especially Space Mountain. It's also handy to buy an Octypus train pass so you don't have to que up to buy single tickets when returning to your destination.","Neutral"
"How does one not give the happiest place on earth a 5? Simple, they let greed win. Greed in the form of no crowd limits, the parks are both jammed each day and night. Greed in the form of exorbitant prices, not referring to the entry, $3.69 for a regular bag of chips? $4.00 for a bottle of water and turn down the water pressure on the drinking fountains? They have taken a good thing and super sized the prices all for GREED.","Neutral"

"Waiting in line for 30 min to see Mickey. Was given photo pass and told photos are free to download. Card says photos are unlimited to download for $10 max pass charge. Exited park at 10pm and went home. Tried to get photos in morning. Found out the window to buy MaxPass closed at midnight previous day so MaxPass unlimited photos for $10 is no longer option. Photos are offered to download free but there is a watermark over image and they are low resolution. Price for photos is now set at $20 each. Called in and they offered me all 6 photos for $79 dollars. This is a classic    Bait and switch   . Very dirty dealing Disney. You are tricking Mickey out from what was a honest mouse into a greasy profiteering rat. Exactly as if I went to my favourite restaurant at 11pm on my birthday. Restaurant policy is patrons eat free after 11pm on their birthday. I order a drink, appetizer, my free meal and desert. The bill comes after midnight and it   s for the full amount because I actually ate the meal after midnight and free birthday meals are only on your birthday. It says this on the fine print on the back of the menu! Didn   t you read the fine print? The restaurant knows this and expects this to happen but advertises the free meal as bait and switches when they offer the bill.","Negative"
"Was very excited to visit the disneyland on my trip to LA from australia but its very busy down there even on monday. Paid $97 each for 1 day 1 park.. Went with a baby and its started raining. There is not much proper shelter as everyone is trying to get inside .. and instead of helping people they start selling there overpriced umbrellas and ponchos... the food was very expensive inside and quality is 0... few rides were closed... got stuck on space mountain for 20 mins and had to come through emergency stairs around 8:20pm went there on fast pass and still waited around 30 mins in fastpass line ... no apologize though and handed a pass to skip the line for other ride when its closing in 40 mins and had to watch electric prade at 8:30 as well... had no choice but just to throw that card. Big lines and waiting times are approx 30 60 mins atleast in every ride . Staff is not friendly nor helpful as waited with the baby for 20 mins in star wars lines only to get it know that babies are not allowed on this ride. Didnt you see the people with babies . Even in front of us has a 2 year old girl and they have to get out as well. If people think that staff service in disneyland if great than the have never seen one in other countries. Come down under to gold coast's dreamworld or seaworld or movieworld here and u ll know what a helpfull staff and great service is. ","Negative"

"Our first family trip to Disneyland Paris, I was worried that our 18 month old wouldn't be able to go on many of the rides and would maybe get a bit bored... how wrong I was! There were only a handful of rides (rollercoasters  thrill rides) that she couldn't go on, she went on practically every ride and loved it (as did we). She loved the carousel, flying dumbos, teacups and meeting Cinderella's mice who were walking around the park.The Christmas parade and the Dreams shows were amazing, I've never heard the word  Wow  so many times!The extra magic hours were also a big bonus as we could get on most of the rides we wanted to go on before it got too busy.The baby changing facilities are second to none, amazing family room where you could feed  change your baby  toddler in warmth and comfort.Only negatives are 2hour   queues to meet the characters and that the food available was very samey (burgers, chips, pizza)","Positive"
"Not recommended. Go to Universal Studios. The park is small and crowded no matter when you go. I went on a Tuesday in low season and it was still crowded, you have to make a line even to go to the restrooms. Way smaller than the ones in Orlando. The park is made more for locals than tourists, when in Florida is the other way around.Don  t waste your time.","Negative"
"Having visited Disneyland and Disney world in the United States I was quite disappointed in Disneyland Paris. The cast members are not friendly and they are not very helpful at all. The entire park can be done in about 3 hours. The food prices are even more expensive than the other parks and we went specifically to see the Christmas decorations and even that was disappointing. Space mountain was broken down and the hours are so short 10am to 7pm. I could never imagine what on earth people with young children do to entertain them after 7pm? They also don   t sell, nor have ever heard of Micky Mouse ears? How can that be?? We did take the train from Gare de Lyon to the last stop and we were right at the entrance of the park. The train ride was about 20 minutes.","Neutral"
"Way too expensive to get in. The park, which used to be kept up, was dirty. Papers and things all over the place. Tried to find a hot dog vender. No more. They want you to go inside one of their expensive places to eat. Security was not to be found. Walt is turning over in his grave.","Negative"
"We had a really good time here but every line is insanely long even during a date that was supposed to have less traffic. Three separate times we waited in line for over 30 minutes for a ride only to be told it was shut down now for one reason or another. Not once did the staff offer a pass to the ride when it reopened or a pass to another ride. This was very frustrating. We did take advantage of the magic morning which I think is a must and we were able to ride a good amount of rides that way. ","Neutral"
"There are some nice restaurants and shops here, but I found Downtown Disney to be too crowded. It's a single strip, sandwiched between the parks and Disney's hotels... so it's both an entertainment dining destination and a highway for foot traffic. If you don't mind crowds, though, you'll find plenty to eat and buy.","Neutral"
"Before travelling I trawled through this forum to get as many tips as possible, so now that I am back I'll give some sort of report along with the tips I took, and my own. We were brought here by my inlaws as a trip to celebrate their 50th Wedding anniversary. Because they booked it all we didn't have any control over anything so it was a bit of a stressful trip. We have two small children, 22 months and 3, it was freezing cold (obviously out of the control of Disney!) and as such the kids didn't enjoy it at all (not surprised!).We stayed at the newport bay club and walked in on both days. The first day we went straight to the peter pan ride and both kids screamed in the queue the entire time (25 min wait). We had to leave the park to warm the boys up and sat in mcdonalds for an hour, as there didn't seem to be anything open where we could sit inside and have a coffee cake etc. After that we came in to the park again but the boys were asleep in the pushchair so just wondered around. Went to the Studios and wondered for a bit, both kids still asleep. They woke up in time for the stunt show spectacular   featuring Lightening Mcqueen (only on for about 5 mins of the 45mins total) It was outside and freezing so the kids got too cold again, except we were stuck there until it finished. My husband loved this as it was car chases etc. Eldest boy mildly amused. Went back to hotel as the kids just weren't enjoying it, and got ready for our meal at L'Auberge. This was also a bit stressful and they didn't eat anything and were scared of the characters. After they warmed up a bit they posed for one photo. That day was a write off and I was very glad I wasn't paying for it myself, thinking it was a monumental waste of money!Day two was much much better. Sun was out and therefore warmed us up by 1 degree, seemed to make all the difference!Went back to peter pan and waited for 25 mins again (during EMH) as my eldest wanted to go on it again. Then tea cups, then casey juniors train ride, then story book land. Then Lunch at Cafe Mickey (recommended!), then they both fell asleep again. End of fun!Went to toy story land 3 times as they are both buzz mad, but on all occasions they were either asleep or too cold to want to get out of the pushchair. Tried to get to the parade but didn't get there in time and didn't see anything. Kids still not interested in getting out of the pushchair.In all, I'd say they were just too young to appreciate and enjoy it. Disneyland itself is amazing, magical and I love it. It's expensive, yes, but what do you expect? My point is, wait until you can have a better chance of enjoying it, instead of constantly getting  I don't want to  or  I want to go home  from your small kid. We didn't really have any issues with queues as we didn't go on any big rides, didn't come across any smokers and didn't get pushed. But then I don't think we were in the park as much as you would be normally.My tips:*Take an extra blanket, you may not need it but if you do it's soooooo worth it. The kids had a much better day on the second day when I brought the blankets out with us. * Take snacks to keep them going. And maybe a flask with hot drinks, as difficult to get somewhere to sit and shelter. They check your bag on the way in but nobody batted an eyelid at the amount of food and drink in my change bag. Plus they didn't check the pushchair if you need to stash more substantial food there!*Take a kettle for the room if you need to make milk for the babies. Or tea for yourself to warm up!*Book character lunch at Cafe Mickey, expensive but so worth it! We also had dinner at L'Auberge and met the princesses. This meant we didn't feel the need to queue at any other time to meet and take photos with the characters. the queues for these were horrendous in the day!*Do the buzz lightyear laser blast if you have a small boy and toy story fan. Morning is best, queue was 25 mins at around 11am. *Comfortable shoes*Thermal underwear for kids! Tie the gloves to strings to their jackets so they don't get lost. Hats and scarves a must. All in one for the littlies even better!*Get a map so you can pinpoint toilets, various stops both for children and inlaws! One in the arcade just parallel to main street is ace because it is indoors and you can warm up while waiting for the toilet goers. Warning, only one set of toilets in the village and you will not be allowed to go in any of the shops restaurants cinema unless you are already a customer of that establishment (fair enough otherwise they would have a lot of maintenance)*Use the EMH to get to the kiddie rides. Fast passes if you can, but the peter pan one wasn't working. *It's a small world annoying as usual, but the kids enjoyed it. Or eldest should I say, the youngest was asleep!*Don't go on the eurostar, too long a trip and too much hassle with luggage and pushchair, although bonus is station right by village. Also, the only train out of there is at 6pm and after checking out at 11am you are stranded for 6 7 hours if you don't have a park ticket for that day.*If you are going eurostar, try and do the Disney express that take your luggage to the hotel, and back to the station, especially if you are stranded for hours on end.*If you are going to see the parade you have to be there at least 4.30 for the 5pm start, otherwise you will see nothing. Even if you stand back because everyone has people on their shoulders. *See the disney dreams show, it is spectacular. BUT COLD! Wrap up for that. Hot drink flask a must for this occasion. Small kids may be scared, eldest ok, but 22 month old just whimpered and cried the whole time (and he is a bruiser normally).I can't remember anything else, but will write in the comments section if I remember!","Neutral"
"Disneyland Resort is well Disney. Yeah you have to wait in lines but it is worth it when you see your daughter smile.I thought that the Disneyland park was better than California adventure. I just love the Magic Kingdom and Epcot. California Adventure is good but it can have some long lines.The first day we got to Disneyland we went to California Adventure and my kids said they wanted to go on this jellyfish ride we waited in line for at least 45 minutes then once we finely loaded onto the jellyfish we noticed that the ride itself was about 40 seconds long. I am not kidding. We later found out that the reason that the line was so long and slow was because one of the machines was broken.Our next day was much better because we went to Epcot.The lines were about the same although the rides were better. (If you ask me.) One of the best rides was sorin in this ride it looks like you are flying through the air you can smell things, you feel the wind in your face, it really is a wonderful ride.The next day we went to the magic kingdom. I just love the magic kingdom. It really is a great place. I love space mountain it is one of my favorite rides. Another ride that I thought was well done was splash mountain and Big Thunder. I love roller coasters and things like that. We had a pretty good trip.","Neutral"
"What can I say except this was our 6 visit here and it is magical as ever. While busy, we used fast passes when possible . Try not to rush things, just enjoy the atmosphere. Don't forget the snacks either!! First off get a dole whip served outside of the tiki room. Turkey legs, giant pickles , the baking ....oh my . Can't wait to return . Stop by city hall to get yourself a button if you are celebrating anything . We came on our honeymoon and returned this month to celebrate our 20th!","Positive"
"Over all I really enjoyed my two days at the resort. After visiting the parks in the states I thought it would be cool to visit an international one. I really enjoyed that the train came right up to the resort, where we came out onto Disney Village. The resort is small enough to walk from the furthest hotel to parks and there is even bus transportation. The Disney village area is an enjoyable part of the resort, it had many stores that I spent quite some time in. Disney Springs over in Florida is a little bigger but the village was more intimate. Disneyland is probably one of the most picturesque Disney park I have visited. You walk under the gorgeous hotel and then under the train station onto a main street that rivals what is offered at the US parks. The attention to detail is phenomenal around the entire park and I really enjoyed the open spaces to sit down and take in the view. This was true of each land even Frontierland that was mostly being refurbished during my stay. The castle was the best one I have visited so far comparing it to the California and Florida parks. The dungeon under the castle was impressive along with an accessible second story that made for great pictures of the park. I really enjoyed that the park had a lot of mazes and walkthroughs that is an engaging experience that is not seen here in the US and I think it should be. Every inch of the park could be explored. My favorite was the Alice in Wonderland maze where at the end you could go to the top of the Queen of Hearts castle and take some great pictures of the park. I thought some of the rides were much better versions that what is offered at the resorts in the states. Phantom Manor was such a unique and weird ride we ended up riding it more than once. Pirates of the caribbean was also much better than the other versions I had ridden. We also ate at the Agrabah Cafe which was a pricey but delicious buffet, we made a reservation a few weeks in advance which I don't think was necessary since the restaurant was mostly empty, they were weirdly turning people away at the door that hadn't made a reservation. There was also a 4.50 charge on refilled for a 12 oz coke, I thought that was crazy. The park has a nighttime show, it was spectacular. It was a mix of fireworks with projections with fountains, I would have watched it again given more time at the resort. I liked a lot of things that park had to offer and I think a lot of what it has would do very well in the states. However, it had many....many flaws. I found it quite surprising how poor the upkeep was of the resort as a whole. Many things were broken like in the passage of aladdin one of the scenes broke and fell into another scene this was not fixed the two days I was there.The alice in wonderland maze, while it was my favorite, it was poorly maintained. All of the bushes in the maze were overgrown and not trimmed and the various props were overdue of a paint job. Actually the same could be said for about 90% of the park. Much of it was embarrassingly poorly maintained. I also really did not like the hours of the restaurants, we were trying to find a place to eat an hour before the park closed and could not find anything except the few places on main street and the one place in discovery land. I found it really annoying that they pretty much forced everyone into just a few restaurants. We went into Casys Corner that we went into also had a lot to be desired. We went into Casey   s corner, not only were the cast members extremely slow but the one I had was very rude. Actually there were a few Cast Members I encountered who were not wiling to help and gave me attitude, my friend had asked about a times guide for the shows and the cast member had no idea what she was talking about and then she described the ones the parks have in Florida and her response was that we were in France on Florida, she said this rather rudely. We ended up finding a times guide no thanks to her. The next morning was also just as slow with food service with barely anything open. I also found it surprising that whatever maintenance they did do, was during park hours. Which led to really overwhelming paint smells in random places of the park where they were working. It kind of took away from the theming a little bit. Many of the things that I found surprising my English cousins did not so maybe its just cultural differences. Over all while I had a nice time and appreciated the park and the rest of Paris as well, I probably would not visit again.","Neutral"
"Disneyland is just as you imagine! Magical....! We went here in Summer however the park wasn't overly busy (for disneyland). We arrived first thing and was there until close, spending much of the day park hoping between disneyland and california adventure. Highlights for me included the night parade and splash mountain, unfortunately the fireworks were cancelled due to weather. Make sure you make use of the fast passes to ensure you maximise your visit. We were here for only 1 day, which was enough however we easily could've had two. You can also get free  first visitor  badges from town hall as you enter, or a birthday free badge if someone you are travelling with if having their birthday. It was my birthday and it was really exciting getting a badge to wear! Perfect for everyone!","Positive"
"First time I went there, it was just okay. 2nd time was boring! Prices are outrageous, and lines are way long. And don't you dare tell the photographers you don't want your picture taken! They'll yell at you for not doing it. Staff wasn't very friendly, and only a few rides were actually fun. I would much rather go to either Knotts Berry Farm or Walt Disney World. Not sure what it is, but Disneyland is not worth it.","Negative"
"After all the hype you hear about Disney it was a sham and a waste of a vacation day. Literally rammed prams left right and centre (babies can't go on the rides) queues for days. I'm struggling to see what adults actually enjoyed it. Would never visit a Disney est again. No rides just attractions. . ","Negative"
"Disneyland park is a awesome place to go because out of all the theme parks it is the cleanest and it is also the one of the funnest places to go. That said it is very expensive!","Positive"
"I have been going to Disneyland for almost 60 years, since I was   1. More recently I have been to Disney World in Orlando many times. This year, Disneyland is truly pathetic. Greed runs rampant. Overcrowding, treating guests like cattle, rude staff. It's the Bob Iger regime. He's made hundreds of millions of dollars squeezing the business like this. Walt would be disgusted at what his dream has become. I suppose all good (great) things must come to an end, and Disneyland is there. If you've never been, go once but be prepared as it will not live up to its heritage.If you've already been, don't go back, it's just sad.Just remember how cool it used to be, enjoy that memory, and save your money.","Negative"
"I have visited both Disney parks in the US and have now visited the Hong Kong park twice. While it might not have the size of the US parks, it is still a great time. One major plus in Hong Kong compared to Orlando and Anaheim is the lack of lines. I'm sure there are times of the year when it will get packed, but we visited in March and never had to wait in line for anything.We were highly impressed with the shows, especially The Festival of the Lion King and Golden Mickeys. The split of Cantonese and English was entertaining and it was great seeing all of the kids' faces light up as they watched their favorite characters enter the stage.They have expanded the park in the last several years, so even people who had been before found something new to entertain them.If you are visiting Hong Kong, Disney is easily accessed by public transportation on the MTR. Take the train to the Sunny Bay stop and then transfer to the dedicated train to the theme park.The park has the usual Disney prices on food (!!!!) but I found the souvenirs to be quite reasonable considering that it was inside a Disney park. They were still by no means inexpensive, but just less than I was counting on.","Positive"
"First visit to Disneyland Paris, the last of the Disney parks worldwide for me to visit. This park is large and has many of the great Disney attractions that one comes to expect to see in some variation. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is simply the best out of them all worldwide, i was shocked at the surprise that this attraction has, and i won't ruin that surprise for anyone. The castle looked like the largest of them all and the colour during sunset was perfect for picture taking. Don't miss the dragon under the castle and the opportunity to visit inside and above the castle entrance. Spent the entire day in the park and loved every minute of our visit. Used the fastpass system to eliminate as many attraction wait times as much as possible. If you do not complete the low capacity attractions with FastPass or during the early morning, simply wait until the end of the day to walk on all of these attractions. This is a big help, we even rode the Dumbo ride for the hell of it since everything was a walk on during the last open hour of the park.","Positive"
"Was expecting so much more. Almost all attractions are for children. No characters around for pictures. A lot of attractions were closed but with no previous notice for us. We expected a similar experience than disneyland in California and disney world in orlando. Its ok for kids  10. No parades or shows scheduled. Dissapointing for the price of tickets. ","Negative"
"The real thing   Disney .. but pales in comparison to the LA or the Orlando Disneyworld. True that it is one of the few attractions which HK has to offer for children. Rides are okay and it can get crowded as is smaller when compared to other Disney parks. Easy access   and the kids will enjoy it, no matter what.","Neutral"
"Visited on a Saturday and Monday non holiday weekend in February and it was simply too crowded to enjoy. I would hate to see what it would be like on a holiday weekend. Battling the hoards of people in order to try and get your money's worth can bring out the worst in us. One man called my wife !%&$  White Trash because she had several children with her. I guess he was fed up with waiting in line all day too. Good thing I wasn't present at the moment or I would be writing this review from prison. The kids said they would rather go camping than go to Disneyland again. What a relief.","Negative"
"Purchasing the tickets for this attraction was very confusing. So many different tickets for different things. This may need to be more clearer. When we arrived (by metro) there was a long but quick queue to get in (this was due to bag and security checks. Which is fair. Drinks and food are allowed to be taken into the park. However selfie sticks are not permitted. There are 2 parks at Disney. The first is Walt Disney Studios and the second is Disneyland. We bought the 2 parks 1 day ticket. We are two young women so we skipped most of the kids rides. This was still not enough time as we underestimated how long and slow the queues are to get on each of the rides. I suggest doing a park a day however we were limited for time in Paris and could only fit in 1 day for Disney. We suggest getting here early to beat most of the long queues and to get fast passes for the busiest of rides. My tip would be to do the popular rides first as the queues are shorter in the morning. I.e Tower of Terror, Rock and Roll Roller Coaster and Thunder Mountain as these rides are extremely busy. Lunch time is extremely busy so we skipped and opted for a early dinner. We had a burger and fries in Walt Disney Studios and let me tell you, this is no Disneyland. This is DISMALAND. The staff look so lathargic, so worn out and not interested. They are grumpy and leave food sitting for long periods of time. Not a great reflection of the park. The food is overpriced, cold and the portions are small. I wish I had brought my own food in for dinner. There is no option from the menu just burgers and chips and the restaurant staff where even starting to pack away tables and chairs and the park wasn't closed for another couple of hours! We got out of Walt Disney Studios and headed over to Disneyland where the parade was on. At the time we went it was supposed to be their 25th anniversary celebrations...well it was a bit drab to say the least. We headed over to Big Thunder Mountain, however when we got there is had broken down so we headed over to the haunted mansion ride where it broke down twice when we were on it. Left sitting for periods of time. After this we headed back over to Big Thunder Mountain, where the queue was supposedly 1hr. Ended up waiting for 3 hours. After this the sun was disappearing and so was the time. So we headed back over for a coffee ready for the parade. The illumination show was anyone's guess as to when it started as the map said look at the park program for times but when I looked in the park program there was no time. I had to go through 3 members of staff to establish a start time. Fireworks were good. The only good thing really that came out of this was the app. Definitely download the app as it tells you the waiting times for each ride so you can base where to go to next from the information in the app.   Quite clever really. Disappointing to say the least. Save your money and go to Orlando.","Neutral"
"Well let me tell you about this place yes it has the wow factor and everything possible to make a dream come true....but the nightmare is...long queues! An hour for mcd's alone. Wear comfy shoes and expect everything to take twice as long as you expect it to. Waiting for a ride can be horrid, upto 2 hours for a turtle ride, kids were bored, so take a guess game plus theres no where to sit whilst standing for hours. I suggest you arrive early and run to the ride you want most. Other than that have fun.","Neutral"
"We visited as a family of 4 2 adults and two 4 year old boys. Unfortunately the weather let us down when we were there. Out of 4 days we had 2 days of heavy rain and 2 days which were ok. Thankfully we ended buying the rain ponchos although be warned these are 10 euro for adults and 8 euro for children. We visited in British school holidays so we were expecting lots of ques etc but we didn't que more than 30 for rides which was good. The food within the park is mostly fast food of average quality. We didn't stay at a Disney hotel so it was nice to escape the parks on an evening. We all loved the rides and can't wait to return when the boys are taller and can go on more rides. All in all a fab place and we we will return in Afew years.","Positive"
"Prepaid for a 2 day ticket but was only issued a 1 day ticket at the park. Cost us 2 hours to fix at the gate on the second day with a toddler which was so cranky after waiting that long in the rain. Not what you want when traveling on a short trip. They did offer a fast pass onto all the rides which was then rejected by all the park attendants once we were inside so we spent even longer messing around once in the park. Sent emails upon our return and also got no responses. Disappointing with the organization and service but the park is a good size for a 1 or 2 day visit.","Negative"
"I love paying a visit to Disneyland Paris at Christmas, I have visited 3 years previously and it's always magical. However I feel this year will be our last for 2 reasons. 1.The rides are constantly having technical faults,even the rides that should have been working during magic hours.2.smoking seems now to be allowed everywhere in this park. Staff do not help in requesting guest not to smoke.","Neutral"
"We had an enjoyable playtime in this park. Ample parking space. Staff was helpful as always. Not saying that Disneyland Anaheim is dirty but Disneyland HK was  cleaner than this one. Food and drink were not a problem. A very good family park. Superb!","Positive"
"Wow! What a great park! I was expecting Disney to be really small and 'boring', judging by what others had written and also in comparison to Ocean Park. My expectations were blown right out of the water! I would not consider the park small in any way (only if comparing to the US equivalent). We stayed all the way from opening time 10am to closing time 8pm and went on 17 rides and attractions in total. We did not get to all the attractions as there just wasn't enough time. People who say they can get through the park in one day obviously skip a lot of rides and don't wait in line to get photos with characters. If you have the time for a 2 day pass it would be worth it. That way you can really take your time exploring the park.Other positives:New grizzly gulch section was great and a nice edition that does not feature in other disney parks (the toy story area was also great). Mystic point is due to open sometime this year and that will complete the park quite nicely. It all means that grizzly point would not result in a dead end and will assist in an easier circulation around the park. Terrain is flat and easy for people of all ages to walk around. People with mobility issues will find this park easier to access compared to Ocean Park. Queuing time is short, usually only takes about 5 10mins (in January). The longest time we spent queuing was 20mins and that was for the mine cart ride at grizzly peak towards the end of the day. Of course this is in winter time, I'd imagine summer would be much busier and more unpleasant in terms of crowds and waiting in the heat.Firework display at the end of the day is a must. Just amazing and this one matches the same disney standards I saw when visiting the US.TIP   I highly recommend that if you want to get a photo with Mickey, Goofy, Pluto or Pooh bear   that you go to the gazebo garden area in fantasyland where the photo area is located. The best time to go is about 5:30 6:00pm. At this time the queues are only about 5 people long compared to the 20  50 people I queued with. The staff in disneyland have good English understanding (compared to my experience with staff at Ocean Park). They are efficient in clearing and organising crowds and what I loved most was their attention to detail. Whether it be in the landscaping around the park, character actors, stimulating queuing areas or cleanliness. It really was all to a high standards.Negatives:There are none. I really wanted to give at least one to be constructive, but I honestly do not have anything that I was not satisfied with.If you are planning to travel to HK I would encourage you to visit Disneyland   even if you don't have young children, it is sure worth the visit.","Positive"
"My family and I purposely chose weekdays to avoid large crowd. To our surprise, it was not as what we expected. Queue for rides, photo taking, food and all (too much to mention) are too long.. just to take a pic with a character will takes almost 30mins.. furthermore there are limited character stationed and no character roaming around to ease the  photo booth  congestion.. staff there are not polite.. the tone of voice and expression are also not welcoming.. THEY FORGET THAT WE ARE THEIR CUSTOMER AND THEY ARE THE SERVICE PROVIDER!","Neutral"
"Been visiting this park for almost 15 years now and this last visit was probably the last one for some time. The park in general is starting to look very tired and worn with many of the main attractions not working on the day we visited. Ticket prices seem to have crept up and I can honestly say that it was a poor day out.","Negative"
"My second visit 4 years apart as we have new grandchildren now. Disney know how to do things well. My advice is not to target just the white knuckle rides as you can do that at any English theme park like Alton Towers etc. Instead target rides like Ratatouille and It's a Small World. Do the big ones too if you have time.","Positive"
"Disneyland is immaculate, wonderfully themed, and very enjoyable, but gets crowded. The weather is soooooo much better here than in Florida, so if you love the Magic Kingdom, you will really love Disneyland.Finding Nemo submarines and the Matterhorn Bobsleds both need to be made fast pass attractions, but they are not. If possible, use the single rider line on the Matterhorn (closest to Alice in Wonderland). My daughter and I did this, waited only 5 minutes, rode on the same train, and bypassed an hour long wait.Good luck and enjoy!","Positive"
"Took my kids there, long lines and boring rides, and they don't even have the haunted house....I won't go there again.","Negative"
"I understand the time we visited is busy period but staff are soooo slow. We visit Florida every year and staff are quick and efficient. Saw lots of empty seats for rides with a 120 minute queue! Food is not great in the parks and expensive. Again slow and massive queues. People walk everywhere smoking! No designated smoking area. I find this a big problem. People blowing smoke into mine and my son's face non stop. Lots of rides out of order or breaking down after queuing for 60 mins to be told leave (no fast pass issues to come back) Just lacking the disney magic you find at Disney world. ","Negative"
"As a family we have been regular visitors to Disneyland Walt Disney World for years. It is therefore sad that we have to say that Disneyland Paris no longer lives up to the Disney Magic standards. Yes, there is a major refurbishment on going, but there does seem to be an overall lack of maintenance and the little things that make Disney special seem to have either disappeared or cut out all together here. Staff seem disinterested and ride breakdowns a regular fact of life. Unfortunately this makes the place just another theme park.One point that highlights the issues is the Magic Hours scheme for residents of Disney Hotels. This allows guests to enter the parks a couple of hours prior to the public opening times to take advantage of smaller queuing times and meet the characters. At Walt Disney World, Florida all 3 parks are open and all attractions running. At Disneyland Paris, only Fantasyland at Disneyland Park was open, and even then only a couple of smaller rides available (it's a small world & dumbo) Disney Studios was totally closed until the public times. Why have a Magic Hours Scheme for only a couple of smaller rides? Disney characters seem to be in short supply and only appear for the parade or pre organised roped off areas, unless you shell out for overpriced meals at character dining. There was no surprise street entertainment waiting around the corners. This isn't the Disney we have grown up with. Would I recommend Disneyland Paris? If you have smaller children and want to trial the experience without a 9 hour flight to Florida then yes I would. But then I would save up for Walt Disney World, Florida where the real Disney Magic lives on!","Neutral"
"This was our third time as a family to the park. We had a good time and got on many of the rides without queuing, very rare as we have queued for hours sometimes for certain rides.The park and the studios park is dated and really needs a good clean. We do enjoy going here but you have to realise that this is run mainly by the french and therefore the normal or expected 'Disney' customer service is missing. We went to Anaheim a couple of years ago and this was the first disney park to be opened, even after all that time the maintenance and the park look better than this one, and Disney Paris is only 15 years old!!!It is very expensive for what it is and meals accomodation is basic. Although, we did find a few buffet options this time in the park for around 22 euros per person. I would reccomend taking snacks and drinks into the park, when they search your bags at the entrance they do not mind that you take such items in. The shows are really good and the whole experience is a step out of reality.Most of the visitors there are very selfish and push jump the queues this can be very annoying. If you get stressed out by this and waiting in line with nothing to look at I would give this Disney a wide berth.Overall, go and expect a euro version of the disney. It cannot be compared to Orlando or any of the other disney this is in a league of its own. If anything just have fun looking at the miserable and unhappy staff compared to the 'All American Smile'!","Neutral"
"I had a lovely few days at Disneyland Paris, but was disgusted by the fact that the park is not a non smoking area. You can smoke in all outside areas. So waiting in line for parades, at the fireworks displays, in line for rides or the outdoor eating areas i was surrounded by smoke from other guests. This is Disney..not family friendly at all.","Neutral"
"We were disappointed to find some of the attractions and rides not in use, not good when you have 2 young children","Neutral"
"We came here on a very rainy day. Which is very rare for LA in general. However, that didn't hinder the experience at all. I'd even argue that it made the whole experience better. The lines for everything were significantly shorter. We were able to easily cover the whole park in one day. The service at any of the eating places in the park were better than what you'd find outside. This park caters towards families so there's something enjoyable for all kinds of people.","Positive"
"The place is magical as described.. the rides have a lot of waiting time but are worth the wait. An awesome experience for the young ones, the place enthralls the adults as well. Do attend the Disney firewall n the Mickey mouse at the end of the day.. the stay in Hollywood hotel is very comfortable. Suggest that u carry enough water n sunscreen as well as sunglasses n umbrellas to neutralize the humid climate","Positive"
"We are a group of 10 with 3 children, the food is bland and tasteless, the kids menu is a waste of money because its worst than the adults. This is a pricey place, it would have been ok if the food is good but for what we ate, its not worth it. Even the staff are not friendly. The only good I can think of ,is the ambiance which is better than the other restaurants there, otherwise avoid this restaurant .","Negative"
"Such a disappointment. The parks look great. The rides are superb. Everything else falls well below the standard you'd expect from Disney. We went to the park mid week, and immediately noticed that most of the restaurants were closed, even the theme restaurants where we'd hoped to have dinner (Buffalo Bills). The restaurants which were open were shockingly overpriced and the food was horrific, the staff were rude and discourteous. At a Disney Park, you expect to meet and see Disney characters (if you've been to Florida you'll know that you can bump into Mickey or Donald as you wander around). There were none, with the exception of the parade later in the day there was not a single character in sight. Such a disappointment.My impression of Disnleyland Paris is that a fantastic American concept has been brought to France, and sadly the French just aren't up to the job of making people happy and delivering the Disney experience. When we went, it just felt like they couldn't really be bothered.","Negative"
"Spent 2 days here with our children, 7 & 8. This park is HORRIBLE. First of all, the park allows guests to smoke virtually anywhere. One smoking area was designated RIGHT OUTSIDE A CHILDREN'S PLAYGROUND!!!! Not that it matters    no one seems to pay attention to the no smoking signs. Probably because no employees back this up. Which is the 2nd of all    employees are VERY hard to find in this park. Except where they are loading or unloading a line. Here, they are very friendly. But sssssllllllooooowwww    which is the 3rd of all. I don't know if it's the culture or just laziness, but employees seemed a little lost on loading and unloading. On a good note, just about every employee spoke some English. The biggest disappointment came when Toy Story 3 Playland wasn't open yet    when it had been advertised as being open in the US.  Invited guests  only. Tell that to a 7 year old who had spent the last month dreaming of seeing it. Guest relations was a joke and outright lied to us    swore there were no people in that closed area when you could see them with your own eyes. I would not recommend this park to ANYONE if they can get to or have been to DisneyWorld Fl.","Negative"
"As part of our trip to Hong Kong, Disneyland was definitely a must do. Having visited other Disneyland   s in the past, this one full filled some of our expectations, but not all.The arrival was easy, as well as entertaining. With special Disney MTR trains, a manicured Station, a grand sign leading up to the park, and a fountain with Mickey surfing above Moby Dick with all his friends watching.We walked straight to the gate queues having bought our tickets (from Klook) and printed them of as instructed. Unfortunately not everyone had done so, and there was chaos as people tried to find get their QR codes to work from their phones as they held up the every increasing line. The park opened at 10am, but no rides were open until 10.30. Even then not all. Sleeping Beauty   s Castle is under refurbishment, so can   t be seen properly or accessed. We rode and enjoyed The Iron Man experience which was a simulation ride, after getting fast passes for Space Mountain. The Jungle Cruise was ok, with queues for the 3 different languages. Don   t be fooled by the short English queue. After riding Space Mountain, we watched the Jedi Training. They catered well again for the different languages using them all. The kids were great.Unfortunately after that the heavens opened, and it poured with rain. There didn   t appear to be enough places for people to shelter, in regards to indoor rides or covered areas. Big puddles everywhere. However the silver lining was they did open Mystic Manor which was closed for the day.Overall not loads of rides, but lots of character meeting areas (with queues of course). Need to be a bit more organised?","Neutral"
"Disliked the huge lines to get on the rides, but it is to be expected when your at the funnest place on earth, also did the disneyland halloween night, awesome fun.","Positive"
"Disneyland is a place where memories are made. When you start walking down Main street, your are taken to a whole different place. A place where you can be a kid again, and you can leave all your worries behind. There is something for everyone there. If you cant ride rides that's ok because there is so much to look at including shows, parades and even train and boat rides! Don't forget the music as you walk along you might here a Jazz band playing in New Orleans Square, or a Barber Shop Quartet singing on Main Street. If you have little kids there are still rides that they can go on as well. It really is a magical place that brings our family back time and time again.","Positive"
"So many things were missing from this park. The castle is so small it is embarrassing and I did not find the American experience translated well. Food prices are obscene   $5 for a bottle of water   so bring your own water if nothing else. There are water fountains but the water is burning hot   really   and I was hesitant to drink it. Mystic Point was a great addition to the park as was Hyperspace Mountain. Strange hours   opening at 10 and closing at 9pm. Also, the train stopped at 6pm which was super disappointing! Why?? Really overall it seemed like a money grab and while the day was enjoyable, as someone in our party (who is a HUGE Disney fan) commented, the place  Is missing the magic . And I agree. Not a bad amusement park   the rides were fun   but the prices... .OUCH! Easy to get to though and the train there is fantastic. Also, a very nice train station at the park so that I highly recommend.","Negative"
"A great place to spend one day with kids, family and friends . But if I compare it with Disneyland California, this park was small with fewer rides and attractions. Someone visiting Disneyland park for the first time would love it but for us, since we had seem the Disneyland California, this was an average stuff. Also found the staff to be less courteous than their counterparts in California. Would like to point one particular incident which left a bad taste. We were standing in queue for a ride and it started to rain heavily. We decided to come out of the queue as the ride was in open and we did not wanted to get wet. After coming out of the queue, we were waiting at the ride entrance with kid for the rain to slow down before we can go somewhere. There were other families with kid too waiting. However the one staff lady came and started saying in a pretty rude tone that we cannot stand there . We are blocking the entrance . I understand we were blocking the entrance which under normal circumstances would have not done, if it wasn't raining heavily. Also due to rain there was no one coming in for that ride anyways. But still the lady staff did not budge and started again saying in angry tone to all kids and family to move away to somewhere else.We had to come out in rain with kid and look for some other shelter. In that process we all got wet. Something which we did not expect at Disneyland. In comparison the staff at Disneyland California were very helpful.","Negative"
"It is a relatively small park, cannot be compared to the ones in Florida for sure! Worse off, we hit the park when the castle was closed for upgrade and no fireworks offered.Most of the park staff we came across were unfriendly and not very helpful with the odd exceptions! In fact they have  Smile  stickers at the entrance turnstile...it must be there to remind park staff since most of us visiting Disney parks have inherent great expectations!","Neutral"
"Absolutely Terrible! Don't waste your money, they need to have some cap on the number of visitors allowed in on any particular day. The day we went there were so many people you could not move.We had to stand in queues to get on rides for over an hour for a 10 min ride. After standing for 4 hours for a couple of rides we had had enough and left in disgust.The food was expensive and terrible and you also had to wait first to get served and the wait for a table to sit at.DON'T BOTHER!!","Negative"
"By comparison with its original in Orlando this is amateurish.1. Ticket booths with insufficient staff or not opened;2. Rides closed during Halloween;3. Inefficient processes to place food orders (Toad Hall   45 min wait with 6 people in queue!!)4. Two rides break down and evacuated on same day (in addition to  2 above;5. Smoking unchallenged throughout the park;6. Shops with no air conditioning and stifling hot;The Disney Corporation should review the management of this venue.","Negative"
"Nothing about the magic of Disney translates to this poorly maintained park. Even though only 1 ride was advertised as being closed while we were there (Magic Mountain), during our 3 days, we experienced closures at all the major attractions  Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean and the Tower of Terror. Many of the restaurants and kiosks were also closed. Staff exuded irritation and seemed uninterested in doing their job. Bathrooms were dirty and flowerbeds and landscaping in shambles. I would not recommend this park to anyone.","Negative"
"Just back and have to say although my daughter enjoyed, the experience wasn't great. Rude staff where everything was difficult for them, unhelpful grumpy (maybe related to the 7 dwarves in Snow White?) money making scam in part as the reality is that even with half board plus the Park or hotel cannot cater for the number of people going through it. The highlight was the parades on Main Street but even then it was a fight for my little one to see the parade was only due to me being determined for her to see it and make sure no adult  stole  her place! Disney should be renamed Queueland as you spend more time queueing then doing. A kind gentleman gave us his tickets to see Ratatouille Ride (which is a must) as we hadn't been able to get even Fastpass tickets and couldn't wait 120 minutes yet 120 minutes in a queue with a 4 year old. Breakfast with Mickey in Cafe Mickey was disappointing food was cold and not all the characters that were promised came and at   39 extra you'd at least expect decent breakfast. Don't book directly with Disneyland Paris if you decide to go as they don't tell you even 25% of what you need to know and are only interested in selling you extra cancellation insurance. Princess Pavilion is a let down DONT queue! We waited for 1 hour 20 minutes thinking we would meet a few of them but it was only one.The magic was damaged on this trip but luckily by daughter only complained about being tired. I wish I had waited to go to Orlando as a first trip but have learnt for the next time.","Neutral"
"If you have read my previous review of this place you will know that I am not it's number 1 fan. however, when you have 3 kids you sometimes have to bite the bullet and return to hell. Anyway, upon arrival you are greeted by a cheery person who relieves you of 15 euros for the priviledge of parking. Now we pre booked our tickets (it still cost   230 for one day for 2 adults, a 15 year old, a five and a 4 year old) and I was glad I did because the gate prices are staggeringly expensive (over   70 per adult for a day!!!). Admission was quite smooth and so the fun began. I will say that it was much quieter than ever before and the queue times were actually not too bad (apart from dumbo ride and thunder mountain where we waited for an hour only to be told that the ride had broken down.......arrrgghhh). What was very evidant is that it is begining to look a little rough around the edges and I noticed litter all over the place...not good!! We took our own food in as food prices in the parks are crazy and the food is rubbish. We watched the parade which now only happens once a day and went over to the studios. I will say that I liked the new Toy Story land which had lots of nice rides for the little ones but the owners need to pay attention to the older areas and give them some attention.Lastly the shops...................the horrid, samey, overpriced shops full of horrid, rude, ignorrant people who seem to have never heard of a queue. Rant over. If you don't like being ripped off don't go here, go to Asterix instead.","Negative"
"I love Disneyland with all my heart. But was so disappointed with the high priced tickets and THE CROWD. We spent way too much money to stand in line as long as we did for all 4 rides we were able to get on before they closed. There must be a fire law that states how many people can be crammed into one place. We were bumping into people left and right. We work so hard,saved money and was so disappointed to see $500.00 for two days gone like that. We couldn   t wait to leave. Such a disappointment! We got on a total 8 rides in two days. Wow! It   s been years since we   ve been there and we   re so excited only to be so disappointed. Disney is definitely making the bucks. I can   t say I   ll be back anytime soon!","Negative"
"Too much money, too many people at all times of the year. Having a day where you can get on the rides quickly is like spotting a unicorn; never happens. I get that they do what Disney does better than anybody else, and yes, your kids should experience it at least once ( over a two day period, because you will NEVER get on everything in one day, due to the long lines). My gripe is the every increasing entrance fee, exorbitant prices for mediocre food and the fact that I can't get to my car if I want to. Not easily, not on my own. I have to wait for a tram to take me to the hinterlands, whether it's in the structure or an outlying lot. My Disney days are done, my kids are over it too, they prefer Knotts and their next step will be Magic Mountain.","Negative"
"My wife and I just returned from a brief visit to both Disneyland and Disney   s California Adventure, and, again we both had a good time     not great, but good.We have been visiting this particular vacation destination for over fifty years, in fact we were both in Disneyland as children during the year of it   s initial opening. We were among those who got a sneak preview of Disney   s California Adventure back when it opened, and various other    firsts    throughout the years. I mention this so that you will have perspective about why I am commenting as I do.As long time visitors, we have been able to see changes to both the physical landscape of the resort as well as the administrative side of the attractions. This visit had its share of changes, some not for the better.We are local, so if the crowds are heavy, or traffic seems to be building on the roads around the resort, we will only stay for a few hours and return again on a different day using our annual passes.Today marks the third time we have visited the theme parks in as many weeks. Crowds were minimal and the sun was shining. Were it not for the annual pass, we would not have returned no matter what the situation was because the charges to enter the parks is just far too much. I am astounded at the number of young families who are willing to support this kind of pricing for this kind of entertainment.Granted, I have basically memorized the details of the parks over the years, and I find it interesting that Disneyland is fundamentally the same place it was when I was a child, yet the admission has risen about a thousand percent, far outpacing the advance in wages over the last fifty or so years. I would take all of this in stride were it not for an overbearing feel of corporate greed that I can   t ignore     especially after so many years enjoying the parks for a hefty, but not tremendous admission charge. I realize that costs have risen, but really? Disney has set admission just at the edge of being prohibitive. As they say, you can shear a sheep many times but skin it only once. Annual pass holders get a break, but if you live out of the area then you pay full fare.I have mobility problems as do many my age, and I had been able to get a pass that allowed me to    check in    for various rides and wait until a return time, then be admitted to the ride via a wheelchair access gate or the fastpass return line. Typically, we would use a fastpass if one was available, but not all attractions are supported by this, and sometimes fastpasses run out well before the end of a busy day. So be it. I have always been acutely aware of waiting in long lines to take a six minute ride, so I am careful to wait my turn now that I am unable to manage lengthy wait times.Today, I was told that neither Disneyland nor Disney   s California Adventure would be offering the mobility access pass, as I had known it. I talked to a couple of employees at the guest services area at both parks, and basically got the same answer. Unless I am seated in a wheelchair or have some visible assistance device with me, there is no longer consideration for folks in my situation. Disappointing and troublesome for those of us who are making the best of a physical challenge. My advice is to carry a cane     which I will do from now on, even though my situation really doesn   t warrant one.I am certain that there are valuable reasons why this change in policy was instituted. My initial reaction is that there was too much labor directed at managing guest mobility issues, and with the inclusion of technology at almost every possible point where people enter or wait, a decision was made to eliminate the old, more personal system.Today, we noticed a decline in cleanliness and general repair. We know that this is the time of year that large scale renovation and maintenance takes place, but there were obvious signs of neglect here and there at both parks. I didn   t see any signs announcing a refund or reduced admission to offset the assorted flaws. Just saying.We will continue to visit both Disneyland and Disney   s California Adventure knowing that they are hideously overpriced, sometimes body to body and have a marked corporate presence that was missing when Walt Disney was alive (I know, I was there). The reason being is they are both family (read small children) oriented and are staffed with nice people. They are basically clean and safe, and there is an air of fantasy mixed with wonder that captivates me no matter how many times we visit. I would hope that if enough of us original Disney kids pressed the issue, perhaps the company would work to return some more of the heart and warmth that was obvious in the early days.","Neutral"
"The people who work there were all courteous and friendly. The park is clean and well kept. Beautiful. Always a pleasure to come here.","Positive"
"The extra magic hours weren't worth it as only main street and fantasyland were open from 8 10 am.The pushy parents and queue jumpers were the things that really spoiled the park, otherwise, the firework show at 10pm (we were told by 3 different members of staff 8pm, 9pm and 10pm) was absolutely fabulous.","Neutral"
"If you want to make your kids disappointed Disney Paris is def. your place to go!!! Im sorry but we been in Florida many times but this one is not even close to that disney. We not enjoying to stand in the line for hours just to have pictures with Donald, or Mickey. Way to overpriced for NOTHING! cheap and tired rides. Approximately 40% of the park is closed, and the stuff is not nice at all...","Negative"
"I just turned 24 years old, and I had never been to a Disney park of any kind. I was amazed at my own excitement. I went with my in laws & it was only a one day trip. I got to leisurely see all the sights I wanted. Ride some really cool roller coasters & never felt overwhelmed by the crowds. In fact, I'm planning my next trip to be DisneyWorld in Feb. 2016!","Positive"
"Star Wars Land Construction will forever change Walt Disney's original vision for The Rivers of America and Frontierland.

"We finally took our kids (10, 12,14) for the youngest's 10th birthday. We spent 3 days spread across this and the next door Disney studio's site. Long enough   I wouldn't go for longer. I would also advise against going with kids that are any younger. The kids need to be taller than about 140cm to get on all the rides. The rides for smaller kids are very busy. Also most of the place is a giant Disney themed shop. So many expensive things to interest young kids. At least our kids were old enough to understand that money doesn't grow on trees and to respect a limit of what they could spend. With younger kids this would be hopeless. The park has had many financial difficulties and it shows   it all looks a bit old and worn out. They haven't had a new ride for years. Having said all of this the kids loved it. Personally I think we went at a good time (April)   not too hot or busy although we were rained on a couple of times.","Negative"
"Over the years, Disneyland has gotten really expensive for what you get out of your money. I've been multiple times in different months and on different days, but it is always crowded. If you're coming from out of town, you'll need at least two days just for Disneyland or for Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. Definitely try to get fast passes because otherwise you're in line forever... The food is also very expensive for what it is....","Neutral"
"I grewup near Disneyland. I had annual passes in the 80's. It used to be a magical place. The grounds were beautiful and enchanting. The workers wee courteous and kind. The grounds are still amazing, but the service is terrible. I saw some kids asking a ride attendant a question, he just rolled his eyes. No smiles, or at least very few. Sad and disappointed for my youngest child.","Negative"
"Everything is great as was the expectation.  At some point, visitors have to stop  going because of COST.  Its a once in a LIFE TIME experience, but they take every opportunity to make you pay for it.","Positive"
"Not even close to the Disneyland in California. The food was horrible and expensive. This is a franchise, so should they have the same food as in Disneyland California?! What happened to the caramel apples, american hotdogs and burgers! How are you supposed to feel the disney spirit without those things? I had their version of a burger and it was down right sad. What a shame, I really wanted to like it but it just wasn't worth my time. There is hardly any attractions or rides. To those who plan to go, skip it and go to Ocean Park!!! There's so much more to do.","Negative"
"My best friend has wanted to go to Disneyland FOREVER and while I've never had much of an interest, it was AMAZING to watch her experience this wonderful world of Disney. While, given the choice, we wouldn't have chosen to go in summer, it wasn't as bad (heat wise or crowd wise) as we thought it might have been.While we did a stack of research to make the most of everything, we still underestimated just how much there was to see and do. Twelve hour days can go by in the blink of an eye because there are so many rides, so much to see and do, so many experiences to be had.Even my cold heart grew warm at the the fireworks which end each day. Between the music, the characters (my best friend was in tears when she saw Dumbo, her favourite), and the sheer scale, it's hard not to be captivated. Post fireworks is a great time to do rides   the park mostly clears out and only the most popular rides still have a line.There are a couple of apps for the waiting times for rides and I can't recommend them highly enough. We were able to enjoy most of the things we wanted without ever waiting for more than an hour.Basically, even if you have no desire, it's a pretty great experience   especially if you go with someone who loves Disney.","Positive"
"HK Disney is a lot disappointing as you don't get the character interaction of the others and there are limited rides, etc around the park.","Neutral"
"Went to see Disneyland and see where it all started. Very disappointed compared to Disney World. People on the East Coast shouldn't even waste their money since we are so used to Disney World it is very disappointing. They shut the rides down when we were there and told us that we could use our fast pass any time during the day when the rides starts again. It appears they shut the rides down when a celebrity comes into the park and make everybody leave the lines so they can get them on. They day we were there they had it on Entertainment tonight who was at the park that day and sure enough the picture they showed was him going into the Indiana Jones ride we had the fast pass too. All the eateries are outside so when it was 104 when we were there, you just sweat the whole time and no place to cool down. I have no idea what happens when it rains but from what I understand it never rains in California. Ticket prices I feel are to high   I got a 2 day pass for 3 people and it cost me $585 dollars for half of a park compared to Florida and that without a park hopper. The monorail was broken also but maybe a celebrity was using it all day.","Neutral"
"ill start by saying we visitred the ppk last week end which i appreciate was national holiday week end in france.  so obviously the place was crowded...  but the queues for the rides were exacerbated by the fact that many rides had cars not working 2 0r more on a lot of rides...think how much longer this makes the queue.....amazingly space mountain wasnt working !!!!! on holiday week end guys get real!!!! its one of the rides !!!! temple of doom ride broke down on sunday for over an hour the tram ride round back lot bvroke down etc now this is not good enough end of... also some restaurants in the pk were closed   disney whats happening you are losing your lustre   add in the daft prices for basic refreshments such as water and burger meals    makes this place unattractive   chessington in the uk offers much more to young visitors ...mum and dad find it less stressful and cheaper ...","Neutral"
"THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH DON'T MAKE ME SO HAPPY ANYMORE!I have been coming to Disneyland every year for nearly 40 years now and never seen it this bad before!The family and I was at Disneyland June 24th threw the 29th the parade was going on, and we was riding the train to Main Street at around 9pm, the train let us off, and sense the Main Street Train Station don't have a wheelchair accessible ramp and the wife and I had to wait to set the stroller up at the bottom of the stairs.When we got to the bottom of the stairs we had to set up the stroller and was told we couldn't stand there in the walkway that we would have to keep moving. We told the employee, aka cast member, that we just got off the train and was setting up the stroller quickly and then we would be moving, and was told stroller or not, we would still have to move because the parade was going on and we was in the no parade watching walkway. We then told the cast member we wasn't watching the parade we was quickly setting up the stroller. She said sorry but you still have to move! We wasn't even blocking others people from walking by.Disneyland needs to train there employees, aka cast members, how to treat there guests. In the matter of 10 seconds it took to set up our stroller we had 3 cast members tell us there was no standing there. Unecceptable!!!We went to city hall to make a complaint about the parade usher cast members, we told them if they don't want people getting off the train during the parade that they should just shut the train station, and trains down during the parade. And that this was unecceptable!!! The cast member at City Hall said she agrees with us and what we are saying, but that there was nothing she could do about the parade ushering cast members. A complaint will be filed with Disneyland corporate office HR Department!","Negative"
"The park itself was fun and we had a great time with the kids. The organistaion was pretty patchy across the park with apathetic staff..The restaurants were all terrrible! Disney seems to have combined the worst of French service with the worst of American Fast food! Worth picking up some French bread and cheeses and taking it in for a Pic Nic. Prices in the restaurants are really steep circa 80 Euros for a buffet lunch for two adults and two children. We also struggled to find pasta for our kids but could only get hot dogs, nuggets etc..Hotel New York was pretty decent..Personally I think Legoland in windsor does a better jon on a much smaller scale..Kids are very happy so makes the high cost just about worthwhile..","Neutral"
"Our 2 days at the park was enjoyable except for a few rides that were under reconstruction and the 3 that actually had broken down that day. The selection of food at Disney is so so except for the excellent Large Smoked Slow Cooked Turkey Leg (this is worth finding). The food available on the California park side was much better.","Positive"
"Disneyland is always lots of great fun. We were surprised by the quantity of rides undergoing refurbishment while we were visiting. The active rides often weretemporarily out of service as well. It would be useful to know ahead of time which rides are out for scheduled refurbishment. Peter Pan wait said 40 min but in reality it is more like 1hr :(, so always rely on the time boards or the app. Overall a great visit. The bathrooms are few, small & often not working. The parades did not disappoint & are a definite must see. Overall, I think Disney could be better & isn't worth a 5 star rating.","Positive"
"We travelled here in February, which I think is the peak of low season, as such, quite a few attractions were closed for maintenance. The park itself is not huge, but enjoyable for my 5 year old daughter. The bonus was that there were hardly any queues and we managed to return multiple times to her favourite rides. The food offering was limited and really bad ... A number of dining joints were closed ... Worth taking your little ones.","Neutral"
"Always feel young and excited whenever I'm in Disneyland. This park is better than expected but a bit old and need a little upgrade.","Positive"
"Went mainly to ride radiator spring but never had the chance. Heard fast pass were gone by 9am such a disappointment for my boys. The line was always 60 120  mins wait. The best bet is to stay at the resort to utilize their perks. Not as huge as Disneyworld and the rides seem rather short in timing. ","Neutral"
"Hated the place. An absolute fortune to get in and then rides no better than you would pay   1.50 to go on at a local fair. My granddaughter is 6 and the rides she was able to go on didn't have fast track and the queues were over an hour long. The queue for the extremely poor value for money food was just as bad. Talking to a few people, while we queued, the overall impression is that they don't care about the people going there, they just want your money. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and would give it a minus rating if that was at all possible. My tip is go to the fun fair near the Louvre. The rides are much better and a bargain when compared to Disneyland.","Negative"
"Disneyland, itself, is wonderful; but you have to wonder how so many people can be wheelchair bound. It's frustrating to see folks abuse the 'handicapped' title. I understand Disneyland is trying to put the brakes on this practice, but it's discouraging. Also, now much of the park is also in Spanish. It was certainly not the joyous experience we had there years ago.","Positive"
"I love Disney and have visited Paris, Orlando and Hong Kong. Don't event think this is going to be like the Disney at Disney World in Florida. It is tiny, the castle is more like a castle ette, but Disney still has that magic no matter what country it is in. This is a great Disney for a first time experience but if you have been to other parks before you are going to be disappointed. One major recommendation   eat before you go. Main Street USA has very few, if any Western restaurants, most are geared towards the Chinese palette. Space mountain is a great ride, and Small World is great too. The jungle experience where you go down the river on the river boats is exactly the same as the one in Florida and the Buzz Lightyear is the same as well.I never miss Disney when I come to Hong Kong, but just be prepared this is not as big nor grand as any other Disneyland.","Neutral"
"Went to Disneyland Park today. Was generally a good day but ended very badly after an unfortunate incident with a staff member named Nathalie at the Storybook Store. Whilst waiting in line, a fellow customer attempted to push in line and get served first. When it was our turn and Nathalie called the next customer, we approached the counter with our items only to be refused service and told that she would not serve us until after she had served the pushy woman who had arrived to the queue after us. As this was completely unjust, we promptly dropped our items and left. There was absolutely no basis for refusing to serve us next, as was our correct place in line. The only difference was that we (being Australian) were speaking English and the other customer spoke French. I can honestly not suggest any other reason why she would discriminate between the other customer and myself other than on the basis of culture. She made us feel humiliated in front of all the other customers. The LA Disneyland is much better, cheaper and friendlier.","Negative"
"Had a wonderful day, so easy to get here from anywhere in Hong Kong, unlike Disney's in the US it's much quieter, space mountain was never more than a 5 minute queue all day!! Longest we queued for any ride all day was 20 minutes but it was more like 10. FYI Grizzly Gulch had the cheapest food options that I saw, the only alcohol is on Mainstreet and there's smoking areas between each park.It gets really chaotic in mainstreet before the parade but that's to be expected.","Positive"
"My husband's first Disneyland experience; I've been to the one in LA. This is not a patch on the US destination which really is where dreams come true. Poor weather   well, you've got to expect that in late September in France   didn't phase us. But lousy customer service really isn't what the Disneyland brand represents. And we experienced disinterested, laissez faire, really couldn't give a toss, 'service' from the start. No boring details necessary, just don't expect the enthusiastic welcome of an American park, where everyone employed there seems to want to be employed there.In terms of the park itself, I'd recommend focusing on Disneyland Park rather than Walt Disney Studios, but only because of the wonderful detail and full experience that the Park provides. When you enter Disneyland (which opens at 10am and the queues only get longer from then on), you enter Disney's dreamland. Each 'world' segues seamlessly with the next and is notable for its amazing attention to detail.Best advice is to get to grips with the FastPass system. If a ride you want to visit has a long queuing time, you can swipe your card at the FastPass reader (if the ride has a FP system) and be issued with an advance booking ticket. This usually lets you come back to the ride in an hour or so's time and gain entry via a special entrance; much shorter waiting time. But not all rides have a FP system and even those that do aren't always working.We stayed at Radisson Blu, a golf resort outside the village. It's got a free shuttle bus every half hour and was a great hotel for adults (not for kids really). If our budget had stretched to it I would have considered staying at one of the on site hotels; they sometimes offer early entry (an extra two hours' worth of visiting) as well as no travelling time.Despite queuing for several hours over the course of the day, we did and saw everything we had intended. Returning the following day for Walt Disney Studios was something of a disappointment   the only highlight here was the engaging movie experience 'Cinemagique'.All in all an extremely expensive visit that won't be repeated, in Europe anyway.","Neutral"
"Great Park to visit. Wasn't so busy during off peak and on Thursday. Easy to get to using MTR but do have to walk a fair bit in before getting park tickets. Shows were the best thing as I am not one for rides anymore. Kids loved the rides and meeting characters.","Positive"
"My first ever visit to any Disneyland and had a great day. They have a priority time arrangements for the key rides whereby you book in and get priority access during your allotted time   allows you to see other things rides and come back and let inTry and position yourself for the 3 parades across the day and stay for the fireworks. Plenty of food options across the park.Transport is best using the MTR network, the trains returning are regular and you didn't have to line up, due to frequency. If I have one recommn cation, save the time and try purchase your entry tickets at your hotel, saves waiting in the long line to get in !!","Positive"
"We loved Disneyland. The place is terrific with great rides and entertainment for the entire family. The light show and parade were the highlights for me. Stay around for the 8 pm light show.","Positive"
"Disneyland Paris is rather average unfortunately. The rides are for the most part good, but some are in need of refurbishment, or a complete rebuild. It's also quite regularly messy, and people seem to like using the caves near Pirates of the Caribbean as a toilet, so the smell in there can be awful. Also the ticket prices are very high considering the above. Worth a visit, but not necessarily a repeat visit!","Neutral"
"Visited here today. perfect weather, should have been magical. The only magical part was the parade, and one or two of the rides. 4 of the more adventurous ride were either broken down or being renovated, 2 of the smaller children rides were also not working. Just a suggestion why not renovate in say November, January or February NOT Easter break weeks. NO mention of any refunds of ticket prices, for the disappointment of these rides not being availableThere is no notice that the Princess Pavilion has to be booked in advance, would be a good idea to say so on web site. It seems lots of events are aimed at people who stay on the park with comments from members of the cast  its full today come back tomorrow  not at those prices. In fact we will never go again, the food was appalling ,overpriced, and the service was very slow. There were very few characters walking around the the site only saw one the whole day.The only thing well run was the parade. Carry on in this vein Disney and the site will soon close. WHAT A SHAME!!","Negative"
"the place is over rated considering the amount of money you would pay while spending most of your time waiting in long queues.........the food and drink is horrible and too much overpriced.....transport to and from paris cost $15.00 by train return...Queensland theme parks are by far better value for the money","Neutral"
"We went to Disney with our daughter and grand daughter and was so disappointed. Over 30 percent of the rides and attractions were closed for major renovations but we were not for warned or given any discount for all the missing attractions. We felt as though we had been ripped off by Disney. As if ripping the public off with the cost of the tickets isn't enough, they then charge you 4 times the cost for everything from ice cream , drinks, food and toys. A big thing worth mentioning to Disney, is why don't you move on the lucky lucky guys outside? They are an absolute nightmare and shouldn't be allowed to hassle the visitors. Saying they are outside the gate and not your problem does not cut it.. PS, Disney don't give me a standard drivel reply because you won't see me or my family again unless you refund the 30 percent entrance fee you should be doing!","Negative"
"I have to agree with a lot of the negative comments that have been made. None of the water fountains worked although they were dotted throughout the park (a ploy to sell more drinks perhaps?) and a lot of the fast track machines were also broke. The restaurants were packed and seating is a major issue. Most of the staff were miserable and did not show any  Disney spirit  saying that, the park and rides also lacked the Disney magic in places and could have been anywhere! There is also some issues with queue times being vastly under and overestimated.The good points! The final display as the park closes is absolutely amazing! Disney characters projected onto the castle with music, lasers and fireworks. The proper Disney rides are great, highlights were peter pan, space mountain and Indiana Jones. The park is just the right size for a full day, we entered at 9.30am and left around 10.30pm. It seems a cheap alternative to Florida and let's face it, it is, but I can't afford Florida! It is worth the money I paid and I look forward to returning one day.","Positive"
"You can never go wrong with Disneyland. If you ever do travel there in June though beware of them closing early for Grad Night. I am not a fan of Grad Night. They close the Park early in order for the grad students to celebrate. Not fun for the rest of us paying customers.","Positive"
"Was surprisingly crowded for mid April, but we still had a wonderful time. Weather was nice during the day, but needed sweaters and pants after the sun set. We always have a FASTPASS in our hands, so we are able to skip a lot of wait time. It means I'm walking back and forth across the park to get FASTPASSES on a regular basis, but I prefer that over standing in line for 40min. Brought Dollar Store ponchos in our pockets for the first time and they worked great on Splash Mt. We stayed dry in seats 3, 4, 5 & 6. We rode the day before without ponchos and seats 1 & 2 got soaked down to our underware... after the splash down.","Positive"
"You will find a huge variety of attractions and you will enjoy every single one of them! Everything from peaceful carousels to thrilling roller coasters can be found there. No matter your age, you'll never forget your visit to Disneyland Paris. I recommend you spare two full days for both theme parks that compose Disneyland Paris.","Positive"
"Ok, not the best park I've been to ( I go to Dreamworld on the Gold Coast annualy with school groups) but very clean, no doubt about that. Small, compact and able to be covered in half a day, this park will suit the small children. Older kids and adults will be a bit dissapointed but you can't please everyone. I was surprisingly impressed by the midday parade. Just remember who it is aimed at and you can see it is done really well.","Positive"
"We enjoyed our trip to Disneyland Paris.The parades   lovely atmosphere; make sure you get there early. Take lots of photos and video if possible. You will want to relive the experience when you get home.The rides   even if you go  off peak  (we went 13 16 Oct Mon  Thurs) it is still very busy. Make use of the Fast Pass system. Generally we queued for 30 mins at each ride. The characters   very disappointing. There are few characters around. The best option is to go to Cafe Mickey if you want to meet characters and get autographs. Meals   Make sure you have reservations for meals   the restaurants are very,very busy. Smoking should not be allowed at the parks.","Positive"
"As a fan of theme parks, i thought it was a shame that I had never visited Disneyland in France! So, i went there really excited! My excitement went off the very first moment! While entering, we were informed that 2 ( the most popular 2 ) attractions were closed down   although we paid for those two as well and there was notice on the official web site from which we purchased the tickets and of course no one bothered to inform us via e mail. Then, it was the expensive awful food, the small number of things to do, the lack of Mickey Mouse (!), the enormous ques to wait and finally the worst of all : Suddenly a wagon ( metallic such as trams ) went by which was full of people ( ! ) and a poor white horse was desperately trying to pull it!!! You could see its agony!!! It ruined my day and SHAME ON DISNEYLAND FOR SUCH MISTREATMENT OF ANIMALS in the year 2015!","Negative"
"It has become very commercialized.Disney is celebrating 50 years and looking at the uniforms it's definitely showing it's age.Along with the worn uniforms the staff appeared complacent with the exception of the characters.My children aged 14 and 11 did not find very many magical moments.","Neutral"
"This is an ideal break from the world, for kids and adults alike. A pleasant holiday, nothing much to worry about   only time to relax and have a good time! Activities are suitable for adults too!","Positive"
"Went on a weekday, still need to wait 1   2 hours for each ride.   Offen need to leave down the stroller in order to play the game   what if someone take it?!  Hotel is good, food are fine.","Neutral"
"Their fireworks show is trully magical!!! (One thing I really enjoyed in HK disneyland). Their attractions and shows are for kids.","Neutral"
"Disneyland Hong Kong is nice to visit with family and kids but doesn't have enough attractions to fill an entire day. Also, there's really nothing for thrillseekers. Even the Grizzly rollercoaster isn't really thrilling. Disney Hong Kong desperately needs some topattractions (Tower of Terror, Rock 'n Rollercoaster,...) The park misses the real  magic Disney feel  because of the lack of enough Disney (movie)themed rides. So no Cinderella, Snowwhite etc.Because of all this I find the ticketprice too high!On the other hand the park is really clean, the personnel are very friendly and the food is good!","Neutral"
"I remember when i was eight, i went there with my family. At that time, the Hong Kong Disneyland was just opened a few months. I was very excited as i have the chance went there. In the morning, when we arrived Hong Kong, we toke the MTR to the Disney Park. We went to the hotel first as we will sleep in there at night. After we had checked in, we went to the Park immediately, I have played many motorized game and saw many show which was made by the Disney too. We also bought many Disney Products there and toke photo with the Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. I thought that the DisneyLand Park was really suitable for the kids to go. All of the products and services were designed with ideas of Disneyland. Even through the things inside the hotels are also designed by ideas of disney too. After the night, we went to other places to shopping and we went back to Macau finally. As a result, I highly recommended you guys to go there.","Positive"
"Had decided to visit the place to celebrate my birthday and since I was having my annual leave. It was a great experience, staff were very accommodating, you could see the happiness from the staff welcoming the guests upon arriving and before alighting from the train. Highly recommended.","Positive"
"We love Disney. Orlando is definitely the best of all the Disney parks, but LA is a great experience.","Positive"
"DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO DISNEY PARIS DURING PEAK SEASON!!! Please listen to this advice as you will be incredibly disappointed if you don't! The crowds are so vast that even if you hold your child's hand it is possible at times that they will be dragged away and lost. The best rides aimed at 6 year olds have queue times of between 60 90 mins and NO FAST PASS. You will simply not be able to ride on the best, most exciting rides unless you are willing to endure the wait with your little one. You will not get to have a picture with Mickey or Minnie even if you see them unless you are incredibly lucky. They get mobbed and have to have several minders who regularly drag them away behind the scenes as the costumes were getting damaged and abused. (We ended up having to queue for 30 mins just to get a picture!)Unless you have breakfast at 7am you are unlikely to get a table at breakfast at your hotel without queuing for 5 10 mins.The auditoriums for shows fill up incredibly fast with people queuing for 30 45 mins before to get the best seats. If you don't queue your kids will most likely get stuck behind adults and have a restricted view. This happened to us EVERY TIME. The best views of the parade in Disneyand Park again fill up very quickly and unless you secure your spot by quite simply sitting on the edge of the path for 45 mins your kids will not be able to see much.OVERALL.... peak season tickets are a huge waste of money and you will end up exhausted and frustrated. Yes our kids had a great time but it could have been far more exciting if we had gone when the crowds were much smaller. Only go to Disney during peak season if you are willing to queue for EVERYTHING.Oh and disregarding the time of year be prepared for everything costing DOUBLE. This morning a very small slice of cheese pizza cost us around   5... YES   5!!!!!!!If you have the money and children who can withstand a longer flight please visit Disneyland Florida. I have been to both and Paris is a pathetic and overpriced comparison!!!TIPS:Bring sandwhich bags. There is bread, butter, ham and cheese available at breakfast. Make the sandwhiches at the table and slip them into your sandwhich bag (within a backpack  large bag) when no one is looking. It will save you loads of money.Ask for a kettle from reception and take the coffee and sugar from breakfast. Fill up a clean baby bottle with milk and store it in your room in cold water. Coffee costs around   4   5. This will save you loads.Buy treats  sweets for the kids before you go and pack in your suitcase. Buy large bottles of water and pack a bottle of squash. Put it all in a backpack.All the kids TV is in French (Playhouse Disney.....). If you can buy a portable DVD player (great for the Eurostar too!) and bring the lead to connect it to the TV. The TVs in our hotel were brand new LCD and have all the connections. We got an 8 inch LG with a six hour battery. Most have a 2 hour battery... choose wisely!Stay at the Sequioia Lodge. It is the best 'budget' hotel set in a pretty and tranquil forrest. Very close to Disney Village and easy to walk. It is the only budget hotel with a swimming pool.Hotel guests can enter the park at 9am so if you can get up earlier you have an hour before the park officially opens. (makes no difference during peak times really as there are so many Disney guests!)Visit Mickey's cafe. The food is overpriced and not that nice but the Disney characters are awesome and this experience made our holiday amazing for the kids. BOOK THIS EARLY WITH YOUR HOTEL CONCIERGE. Queue times can exceed 45mins for a table otherwise.If you have a buggy get a bicycle chain and padlock. You will have to leave your buggy at the railings of many, many rides and so many look the same yours may very well get stolen! Pack waterproof clothing. The heavens opened today and pathetic and flimsy ponchos cost   10 each!!!Get your Euros put on a debit style card from Thomas Cook. It is widely accepted and saves loose change being lost on rides.Plan, plan, plan ahead. Do your research and ask staff for advice. it will save time and enable you to do more.","Negative"

"I booked this trip for my 5 children, not for me! They loved it.... I could not believe how expensive everything was... Food was bonkers money and nothing healthy or any real choice (burgers, nuggets and chips) The rides are good but boy do you queue for them... The parade was great to see but when you've got a 3yr old and a 5 yr old who really want to see the characters and RUDE people keep pushing them out of the way it kinda takes off the shine!Would I come back  nope, once was enough!","Neutral"
"It is hard to rate a Disney park 2 stars. It may be harsh, but the expectations are different for Disney. They set their own bar and this park falls short. The biggest issue is half the park is under repair. No Thunder Mountain, no Small World, no Star Tours, no Alice. Then some of the rides need help. Space Mountain has ripped seats and is obviously in need of a face lift. The Indiana Jones ride may break someone's neck if they don't get it updated. The kids had fun, but it is not living up to the Disney name.","Negative"
"We visited Christmas Day and the 2 days prior. Christmas Day was not enjoyable as there was soo many people!! Wait times where we'll over an hour and we were constantly fighting the crowds. HOWEVER.. Christmas Eve eve was still busy but we just watched the shows and met the characters during the day (as ride times where quite long) and went on rides at night as the crowds had died completely off! Fast pass was a bit of a waste of time to be honest as you still had to wait in the ques and could not book another one for a couple of hours after. ","Positive"
"What a great day to spend with grandkids.  Always magical.","Positive"
"Visited the park a little while ago   can not believe why people think it is a good park. The only worthwhile ride is space mountain   all others are rehashed, watered down and worse    MISSING. Can not believe why this park could be called Disneyland when a majority of the classic rides are missing.In my humble opinion, what constitutes a disneyland park MUST include:1. Castle. Check. HKDL has the smallest one! Just look at Tokyo and Orlando, not to mention the beautiful Paris castle. Even the smaller castle in LA is gilded and looks much nicer, even though it is 50 years older!2. Dumbo. Check. Smaller ride capacity than the Orlando version3. Small World   MISSING   It is available in different incarnations on ALL other disney parks! This is absolutely unforgivable.4. Pirates of the Caribbean   MISSING   This is probably the most classic disney ride   again, unforgivable5. Haunted Mansion   MISSING   Again unforgivable. Absolutely classic Disney ride6. Splash Mountain   MISSING   This is one of the best rides, unfortunately people who come to Hong Kong will never experience it.7. Big Thunder Mountain   MISSING   Another absolutely great ride missing8. Peter Pan   MISSING   Can not believe this absolute kid's favorite is missing. In other Disney parks, kids would queue up to 45 minutes to get into this ride9. Space Mountain   Check   have to say this is one of the best incarnation   the only good ride in the whole park10. Jungle Cruise   Check   this is a watered down version, no caves or temple for the boat to pass throughALL other parks   Tokyo, Orlando, LA and Paris has ALL OF THE ABOVE. Seriously, a park should not be called a Disneyland when any of the above is not present. This is serious deception on Disney's part. I hope they will quickly rectify the situation or continue their downward spiral. No wonder they did not meet the target attendence numbers. I would have travel there with my family at least once a month if they built it like the other Disneyland parks.Also many other attractions missing: Enchanted Tiki Room, Star Tours, Snow White, Alice in the Wonderland, Country Bear, Fantasmic, and ENTIRE SECTIONS COMPLETELY MISSING: Liberty Square New Orleans Frontierland and Absolutely NO ToonTown!   A very, very Dissapointed Disney Fan","Negative"
"We have just returned from a visit to Disneyland Paris and having visited both LA and Orlando on numerous occasions we are surprised that these parks in Paris have the Disney name.To say that we felt  ripped off  is an understatement. Two cheeseburgers, small frites and med cola, 6 chicken nuggets meal and kids meal nearly   70.This was not a character restaurant   my grand daughter (20) and her god daughter (5)went to the Princess meal and that cost them   85!!! We had researched that before going but decided that was a meal not to be missed hence why !only one adult accompaned the child.A small box of popcorn was nearly   5 't get I won't go on but after paying for the entry tickets dont get ripped off for food and drink   a small bottle of water was   3.50.","Negative"
"We visited in March 2011 and it was our fifth time. There won't be anymore. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was closed due to refurbishment. This was a massive dissapointment as it is arguably the best attraction they have. The was a hoarding outside the front reading 'closed for refurbishment and you future entertainment'. Do these people think we can just pop back over when they've finished? Another popular ride, Big Thunder Mountain, was also out of action for two days due to technical difficulties. This was the nail in the coffin for me. As a result of these closures, there was around four or five hundred extra people in circulation . This made the place a lot busier and queueing a nightmare for everything except 'It's a small World' because nobody wants to go in there anyway! The French were the usual arrogant and impolite people we have expected them to be. The prices in and around the parks have become astronomical. Just under Seven Euro's for a pint of warm beer. The food was also horrendously expensive and largely awful. For what it cost us as a family of Four, we could have gone to Spain for a week and probably had a much better, and less stressful time. We will never, ever go back to Disneyland Paris. They need to stop ripping people off!","Negative"
"Attitude of most of the staff is dreadful   forget the warm welcome of the US Theme Parks   the staff at Disneyland Paris are a miserable bunch with bad attitude. No smiles, no warm welcome just bad attitude.Park looks worn and shabby and is above all dirty with people smoking everywhereSome of the rides were not working and the people operating it did not even realise (or care when politely told)Toilet facilities were very few and far between   once when absolutely desperate the one toilet I found was locked. I nearly had an accident!Food is disgraceful........then consider you are in France and it is mind blowing that anyone could think that serving that rubbish is acceptable. In the 5 star hotel they served powdered eggs.........seriously?Crap coffee served park wide.......WHY BOTHER HAVE THE PARK IN FRANCE!Overpriced   over    250 to go to the Wild Bill show. Shops sell overpriced rubbish   all made in china. Disney you need to up your game.","Negative"
"It was mandatory that we go to Disneyland as my 3 year old daughter is a Disney fan. It was a very good experience for her to see the 3D show, pose with Tink, ride Dumbo, etc. My daughter loved it so much and she talked about Disneyland for a long time.It was a different story for my 7 year old nephew who has been to Disneyland twice before. Given a choice, he wouldn't have joined us. There was nothing new to offer to him anymore. The other adults who had been to Disneyland felt the same way. They were just so happy to witness my 3 year old revel at the theme park. It didn't help that it was a very hot April day and the rides were very long when we went Disneyland.","Neutral"
"I stayed 3 days in Disneyland Paris and Walt Disney Studio and for sure I've been amazed by this place. The park is beautiful, clean and the thematic of each small lands works very well.We loved most of the rides even through some don't last enough. Space mountain, Phantom Manoir and Ratatouille are among the best!Overall we enjoy our lunch experience: Agrabah cafe is nice and Blue Lagoon very nice yet yes it's extremely expensive...Now the little bad point is that half of the park is in rehab. Almost all Frontiereland and Advanturland are closed ! In the sunday the park was extremely crowded, and because so many rides where closed (Peter pan, BTM, Pirates area, Aerosmith...) the waiting line for other rides became extreme!!!! In average 1h30 of waiting! Thank's God we had many hotel fast pass that we succeed to used all in the same day and so we avoid this killing waiting time... Disney should really find a way to managed this waiting time better ! We even had difficulties to cross the park as the avenue were crowded like hell. The monday is was a way less crowded ... But still 2h for cruch coaster.Many Trip Advisor comments point out this extreme waiting time now it's up to Disney to do something....","Positive"
"Still a Disney fan   but upset by misleading meal packages at Disneyland Paris (DLP). I am in a long term dispute with DLP over their Disney Meal Packages. What they state on their web sites is not what the meal vouchers say.Last year we booked an  All Your Meals for Free  package (now replaced by  Half Board  packages). From the DLP web site it appeared that this offered a great deal for lunch and dinner at table service restaurant and saved us concerns about the poor   :    exchange rate.When we got the vouchers at Ashford Station (we travelled via Eurostar) we found that only one meal per day was table service or buffet and the other was only counter service (i.e. burger, chips,cola and a yogurt).As such the package deal was not a saving and in fact I think it cost about 40% than paying for the meals directly. It is good for Disney as it guarantees the revenue stream.DLP are saying that the meal restrictions were clearly shown on their web site but they have been deleted now. They are now refusing to discuss the matter further so I am escalating to their CEO.To save any problems, I suggest you print out all the booking details in advance and save any web pages on your PC just in case.","Negative"
"How can you not love Disney and Disneyland, recently took our son for his 4th birthday. Having been before we knew there would be an element of queues and waiting around even outside kids summer holidays and start of the week. Saying that think we queued Maximum of 40 minutes for a ride. The parades and shows are spectacular and the firework spectacular with the show projected onto the castle is a must see for kids and adults.If you want to get shorter queues for be popular rides I recommend staying in a Disney hotel, we enjoyed 2 mornings of walking straight into the busy rides and that frees the day for those that were shorter to wait for.We did breakfast with the Disney characters, you can see how much all the kids enjoy the interaction and getting autographs.Only negative for me was he food concessions around the parks. Thy needed more staff. When we visited it was early 30 degree in temperature and the staff manning predominantly drink and ice cream led concessions were clearly over whelmed. More staff and support would have helped them and cut down queues for all.Also I don   t recommend getting he slushing re fill, we struggled to find places that sold it and those that did were not always serving it due to it not being cold enough as they had sold out and were topping back up.Looking forward to our son being a teenage to take him to Florida.","Positive"
"Brilliant! Queues weren't too bad especially through the week,got on all the rides.Very expensive but it is Disney so expected it. very clean.Wonderful 4 days will go again!","Positive"
"The rides are good but my 9 year old boy enjoyed only a couple. Disney could do better with food by adding lot more in local cuisine. Getting to Disney is easy and best in HK. Iron man ride coming up which should be added attraction for boys. The evening parade is electrifying!","Neutral"
"Very, very disappointing. Having visited Florida ourselves as teenagers, we had high hopes when taking our 3 year old to DLP. I am a Disney fan and a general theme park fan and was excited myself.We will not be returning and will save up for the authentic American experience.DLP was filthy dirty, the staff were rude (we even witnessed a staff member shouting at a tearful girl in a princess dress) and unhelpful. Customer  services  were also hugely unhelpful. Chronically understaffed. Most rides had something broken on them, breaking the spell. Water rides had rubbish floating in them for the three days we were there. Set pieces were either broken or not lit. Thick dust on the exhibits. Staff did not hurray people on and off rides (people were actually taking pictures of themselves in the rides) which led to extreme queues.We booked a Disney hotel so that we could experience  Magic hours  which is access to the park two hours early. What they don't tell you is that they only open 5 rides so that you are in a 30 minute queue at 8.30am with a crying toddler. Deep queues and slow service from everything to rides to restaurant. We had to wait 45 mins even when we had booked. One meal took two hours and when it arrived it was horrible and dried out. Water in the parks is 3.29euros   a scandal. Character breakfast was like a cattle market, one lot shipped out and next one in, dirty table and plates. Food all round was expensive and poor quality. Shuttles to the park were often late and irregular.There was one fantastic waiter in our hotel. it is telling that my son often says he wants to go back to see the waiter, not Disneyland Paris.","Neutral"
"I came here with my girlfriend, she has been here before and loves it. I am not hating on this place, it is a cool place but for a couple or someone without kids I think it only has so much appeal. All the kids there seemed to love it, they all had huge smiles and it was awesome to see so many children having a great time. I just don't think there is much there for a purely adult demographic which sucks because adults pay the entry fees. Saying that, it is Disney Land and the place is pretty spectacular. The grounds are clean, well manicured and looked after, there are plenty of staff there to assist guests. The entrance fees are very expensive, 74 euros per adult for a 2 park pass for one day is pretty ridiculous in my opinion. I have been to many, many theme parks on 4 continents and this was the most expensive by far. The food and drink is also more than you would pay outside the park but it isn't ridiculously expensive to their credit. For most of the attractions you are looking at  30 minutes, saying that the lines did seem to move faster the majority of the time compared to the predicted wait. There are little electronic clocks at the front of the attractions that alert you on how long to expect. This is a good idea and allows you to time manage better. Most of the shows are similar to other parks like Universal Studios, Dreamworld and Warner Brothers movie world to name a few but they are still entertaining. The movie magic illusion show was amazing, probably the thing I enjoyed most in both parks. The movie studio park closes officially at 7 yet at 5:30 we couldn't buy food or drink from several of the vendors there. Be warned also that most the shows, rides and parades etc finish earlier at both parks well before closing ie at least an hour, be sure to check the program. I didn't get to go on a few of the rides but the simulator, pirates of the Caribbean and a few others that I thought would be exhilarating failed to hit the spot. I think the rides cater more to the kids which I understand but there are many rides coded blue which means family friendly for kids and only a few coded orange for exhilarating rides. The ones coded orange took it to a comfortable level but just when you are getting the adrenalin pumping seems to be where they peak. If you are a thrill seeker or there with some friends and want to experience some rides that are going to knock your socks off, I would recommend you look elsewhere.","Negative"
"I travel a lot and I have seen a lot of places. It has been more than 10 years since my last visit here. And I can honestly say that this has been the best holiday in my entire life. Everything was so perfect en very romantic. At first: Everything is extremely clean. Every toilet, all the floors and restaurants. This place is so well well maintained. You are almost tempted to try eating of the floor for once (just kidding).All the employees at Disneyland are so very helpful and kind. Trying to entertain everyone and make the best experience as possible. There are a lot of options concerning food and drinks. Wether you are a vegetarian or not. Wether you like pizza or salads. Every single human being is well looked after.For couples this is just the most romantic place ever I guess. There are a lot of things to do, this is not only a park for children. Does not matter what age or where you come from. You can go to the theater, watch shows, go out for a lovely dinner, go shopping, seek thrill in some heavier attractions or take it easy in the more romantic ones. It is not just just a park with attractions and Disney characters. It is a magical experience for everyone.","Positive"
"Stayed here in March 2017. It was our 8th, and last time. Yet again, a handful of the better rides were closed. The one that were open kept breaking down( Big thunder mountain was closed more than it was open). No apologies from these people. Even the fast pass ticket machines were occasionally closed. The fast food restaraunts have become really expensive. 14.99 Euros for a burger and chips! It's not the place it was ten years ago. If the entire park isn't open they shopud reflect this in their prices.","Negative"
"We went to Disneyland and California Adventure Park on July 4th and 5th. To our surprise the crowds were not as heavy as we had anticipated. We have been to Disneyland many times in the past and still have a good time. This trip was fun as well but we were surprised at how expensive the cost of a two day park hopper passes have become. Maybe that   s why it was not so crowded? LOL! The fireworks were great, entertainment (Tomasina     Tomorrowland Terrace) was super and the rides fun.","Positive"
"We bought a 4 days for the price of 3 ticket but feel we didn't need that long as we had had enough after 2 days really. Being half term we did expect it to be busy but the queues were very long particularly the 'thrill' rides. Although these usually had fast passes you had to wait a long time to use these and for certain rides could only go once eg Ratatouille or wait over 60 minutes to go again. I was particularly disappointed with the princess pavilion my daughter and I queued for 75minutes to see ONE princess. They also forgot to ask if we had met any before so we were put in the line for Cinderella. When I realised that was it, I complained, initially I was told this was my fault but eventually the person at the front realised their mistake and we met Ariel. My daughter was disappointed because Cinderella (who we had met at the Auberge for dinner) had led us to believe that we would see Belle at the Pavilion. I Could not believe you only saw one princess. Having been fortunate enough to have been to Disney in the US when we lined up to see the characters in Epcot there were 5  to see. There were also many more encounters within the parks without the painful wait. We too disliked the number of smokers within the park that had no regard for children non smokers. We took our own food and drink in which did save us some money entry was enough!! We bought popcorn at great expense!Have to agree with comments about the condition we too noted various cars in rides that were not in use and this surely prolonged the wait times. Regarding baby swap  this seems to cater for families of 4 not 5 or more. If the parent who was looking after the baby or child too small for a certain ride then wished a turn they had to chose between the child they travelled with rather than go as a unit like the other parent had before. This led to arguments between the children who were both keen to go again. Did enjoy the fireworks but agree these should be done earlier. We went on Halloween when the park closed at 7pm so they were 20 minutes before and our 5y old could watch which was great. Otherwise they were at 9.40 which is just too late. Another note for any uk visitors the prices in uk disney store for many of the items eg frozen are cheaper with current exchange rate","Negative"
"Staff are polite. Food is, unless you hunt out the few decent restaurants (blue lagoon and alike) appalling fast food. Queueing... absolutely terrible ... over 2 hours to get on some rides. Limit numbers Disney or do something. Having paid   50 per day each, in reality we got onto 3 4 rides in the day!!!! Expensive rides & disappointing for our 6 year old. With the numbers crammed into certain areas I would be very concerned in the event of fire or other terror attack there is no way you could escape quickly. Despite its magical feel, we won't be back.","Negative"
"We visited California Disney about 7 years ago. We loved it and spent three full days enjoyed every suitable attraction. The rides were all like an experience or adventure. With that in mind we decided to spend one day from our European trip at the Paris Disneyland. We arrived by car on time for the opening at 10am. It took some time to get from the car to the entrance however this was ok as they had supplied travelators. As for most places now we had a bag search, then as We had pre purchased tickets we ust joined the gigantic mass of people, no queues, and pushed and shoved until we went through a turnstile. We saved 5 euro per ticket by buying at a local hotel. Cost was about $100. With forethought in Australia we could have saved much more by buying online. As we couldn't access a printer we couldn't do this in Paris. As it was winter the crowds were OK. The rides were generally just amusement park style, not Disney style. The haunted house was pretty good, the Indiana jones just a roller coaster, not anything like the real Disneyland but ok for what it was. The railroad ride was fun. The teacups were fine and the dumbo ride was the same. Star tours was a good ride and the laser ride buzz light year was fine with a fast pass. Aside from that the rides were boring and not very many of them. Many attractions were closed for winter maintenance without any warning of this when purchasing tickets. The food areas were packed with not enough seating, and very expensive food. The stores all sold the same items, as expected overpriced. The store assistants were surly, and on one purchase the man was extremely rude and nasty. I really did not feel as though I was in Disneyland. I saw three characters only all day (outside of the afternoon parade) and they were moving from one venue to somewhere else and refused to stop for children or photos. The only way to see any of the princesses or mickey was to line up for up to an hour. When standing in the street for the parade the security type people were rude and pushy and continually barked at everyone to get back. We left after that although we still had extra time left as we were not enjoying it. The atmosphere of the USA Disneyland was so lovely and this was nowhere like it at all in any way. I would hate to be there in summer as even at this time in the middle of winter they couldn't cope with the numbers of people. The park is too small for the crowds and needs to be enlarged and give the staff public relations training.","Negative"
"If you don't like French rudeness then don't go here.  You are much better off saving up and going to Florida where the staff are properly trained and actually like their guests.  Most of the staff here felt like they were doing us a favour!","Neutral"
"Our family visited Disneyland Paris on Oct 24, 2017. We had booked for the Magic ways shuttle from Paris. It was raining and no shelter before you board the bus. They could arrange the pickup from a bus stop instead.Finally bus arrived and they took some time to check every one's ticket before boarding.There was no any sign on the bus showing disneyland or Magicways.We have been to Hongkong disneyland earlier. So we knew what we are going to see. Our 2.5 year old son doesn't knew what he is going to see.Once we reached the disneyland, we passed through the gates. Every thing was fine. We had some food but we were not stopped. So this was good.As expected, even though it was raining, lots of people on a weekday. Queues everywhere. We enjoyed couple of rides.Day was nearing the dawn.We had to rush for your return shuttle at 8.00 PM. There was no signs for the correct bus. This location allowed all tour buses to be parked. So it would be better if they assign specific parking lots for magicways shuttle.Driver was speaking little english and he said to take any bus. Earlier in the morning we were told to take the same bus. Finally we reached our hotel safely.","Neutral"
"Very crowded: Takes minimum two days to cover both the disney park and studios. You have to wait for 50mts and more to do a 1 ro 2minute ride at the most!","Neutral"
"Went with my 2 children aged 5 and 10 for 1 day and then for the halloween soiree the following day. Travelled by train from our base about 20 mins away, we found the resort very easy to get to but the first impressions werent fantastic to be honest, bags checked before entering the resort which was understandable, but then we couldnt find any directions as to where we needed to queue in order to get our tickets. We queues for about 20 mins and when we got to the front we were told we had to go elsewhere, very chaotic due to the vast numbers of people, then we were hassled by ticket touts that would not take no for an answer! I really think they should pay closer attention to the people they are allowing into the resort as we noticed several men hanging around the ticket offices surely disneyland have the authority to remove them? And am I not right when I say ticket touting is illegal?? Anyhow we managed to gain entry into the park eventually, and decided to go and try to get a coffee the first place we went into we couldnt find a member of staff anywhere, waited for a good 20 mins but still no sign so we decide to go and try to get on some rides and make the most of the day head down to the castle and there are literally hundreds of visitors milling around, and theres one member of staff letting people into discovery so we join the queue again only to find our tickets didnt allow us access until later in the day  now I was starting to loose my temper by this time, We havent visited disneyland before and just felt the initial signposting welcome and complete lack of any explaination of the rules has started to ruin the whole experience. When we finally started to use the rides the queues were horrific, up to and over an hour for the more popular rides, even such as dumbo and the carousel! Shocking really, I expect to queue for big rides but am surprised at the vast numbers of mainly adults taking up seats on rides designed for kids on its a small world the boat probably holds 20 passengers and of those the only children on our boat were my 2! Unbelievable, I am no party pooper, and agree the park is adult entertainment too, but surely children could be given a priority queue in rides such as these?? Adult only partys can surely wait longer than preschoolers?! Anyway, thats a suggestion I will be making to Disneyland, along with a clamp down on the smoking ban!! I got very cross with adults smoking in the queues, blowing smoke in the direction of my asthmatic daughter  this would not happen in the uk so why is it acceptable there?! Ok if you must flaunt the smoking ban, and cant possibly make your way to the smoking areas provided at least stand out of the way of the crowds!  rant over! : )So onto the food, quite overpriced we thought but edible at least, be prepared for yet more queues though and hope for a bit of luck if you wish to sit down and eat, its quite unlikely you will find a spare table. Again if you need to use the bathroom dont leave it too late there will be more standing in line and patiently waiting.So onto the positives, the rides we managed to try were quality, buzz lightyear was good fun not to be missed and we had a ball on autopia. The castle, and fantasyland is amazing, and the parade and pm lightshow and fireworks were just awesome but you need to be prepared to find your place and sit there for at least an hour before it all starts, and then you are likely to be surrounded, hussled and bussled and most probably someone will come and stand right infront of you halfway throught the show! We found the park very clean and tidy much better than legoland and the pushchair hire is an excellent idea. Overall we wont be going back, I am glad my children have experienced it but its not something I wish to repeat!(and we'd probably need a lottery win for a repeat visit!)","Neutral"
"Staff very nice, but line ups horrendous even in February. Day pass of $100us is expensive, and food also ridiculously expensive. We were there in torrential downpour and there was nowhere covered to eat because they said  it's California . Really??! So freezing & eating outside unless you reserved a restaurant the day before, with penalty for no show and set menus. Rides ok, my 3rd time so I m done with Disneyland, but I give them marks for very clean, no smokers, no  sadness  or reality (ie homeless, beggars, dog poop), and architecturally very well done. Stood in line for Frozen musical and was canceled with no  Front of line  to return later meant I never saw it. Crowds horrendous during nightly parade meant impossible to get from one side to the other.","Neutral"
"We visited on Friday October 4th. The weather was lovely and the park was very quiet. We just love the atmosphere here. The park was decorated for Halloween and looked beautiful! The decorations were basically sunflowers and pumpkins with a little Disney creativeness thrown in for good measure also sound effects which were fun. The Halloween parade was beautiful and that was running about three or four time during the day, We managed to get many rides in both parks on the Friday and came back to see the  Disney Dreams  show in the evening after dinner. This show is brilliant and a must for all. My little Granddaughter said  Even the fireworks are magic and don't bang!  This is very true even though they are magnificent and big there is no scary noise for little ones. The park was busier on Saturday and Sunday but still a very enjoyable time was had by all. Can't wait to be back !!","Positive"
"We went with our 18month old daughter and it wasn't what I expected at all! The Disney characters do not walk around for you to meet like we thought you have to pay extra to meet them for breakfast which just felt like another chance for Disney to make money! There are good rides but the waits are lengthy and to be honest it just seemed like a huge shop...they are everywhere and overpriced along with the awful food. We paid 34 euros for two cheeseburger meals and 6 chicken nuggets! The park itself is well kept and lovely but for the cost of the tickets (74 euros per adult and 66 per child) plus the parking and extras on the day I'm afraid for us it really wasn't worth it!","Neutral"
"This is the smallest disneyland ever, the staff are very unpleasant! Boring staff! Dissapointed with the refurbishment of tomorrowland! A very small Magic Kingdom! The knky good thing maybe is the transportation by MTR and the shop in the main street section and they have a short fireworks dont waste your time watching that!","Negative"
"Let's move past the fact that 7 major rides broke down. Maybe it was just a bad day. Disney seems to be moving away from charming and just selling out. Tom Sawyer's Island is mostly pirate themed now, with no fort, no treehouse, and most caves closed. It was awful.Submarine ride replaced animatronics with underwater video screens and you basically watch clips from Nemo. (No mermaids, Atlantis, or sea monsters anymore). I want to go on an adventure, not re watch movie clips through a porthole. The Star Tours ride featured literally a hit and run on Chewbacca, who you leave for dead (it is supposed to be funny the way he splats on the windshield but then they re use the same windshield splat gag two more times with a bug and a sea monster.) We went during the Christmas season so some rides had been re themed. They did a great job with the Haunted House, but It's a Small World replaced the song with Jingle Bells. So you only hear a couple snatches of the original song. Love it or hate it, the ride needs the original song. (at least do half and half???) Also no Hanukkah in it. Or any other winter holiday. Even though diversity is the point of the ride. Huh?Tarzan's treehouse is missing a lot of the cool features it has when it was Swiss family Robinson's treehouse. The Jungle cruise (renamed Jingle cruise for the season) was supposed to be holiday themed, but that only meant they wore santa hats and told 2 holiday themed jokes. Really. That's it. The park was terribly overcrowded to the point of not being able to move. And I notice that several rides have had the lights dimmed so you don't see details anymore. (Peter Pan and Pirates being the worst)Now there were some good things.Fastpasses and single rider lines saved the day for us. Most of the broken rides were fixed in time for us to get on them (Except Space mountain which broke again) and Fantasmic was awesome as usual. Food was great, even though pricey. And the staff were very helpful.","Neutral"
"Went to Disneyland with my brother right after the New Year when all the Christmas decorations were still up (we're both in our 30s). While we had a great time, despite long lines, crying tots, wheelchair bound grandparents, and cold temperatures but I was SHOCKED at how pricey everything was! Total expenses for the day: burgers & fries for lunch in California Adventure Park ($30.00), Starbucks coffee ($4.00), bottle of water ($4.50) and the cute hat I wanted but couldn't afford ($25.00). All told plus the tickets we spent over $200!! Now I remember why I only go to Disneyland once in a blue moon.","Neutral"
"We went to Disney Paris for an Xmas break with our family this year and although the rides etc are quite good and similar to the ones in the US parks, you cant help but feel it isnt as good as the  Real Thing . The parades especially on xmas day where very short and poor, the lighting at night practically non existent, and worst of all the food choices where very limited and expensive. I've been 4 times to Orlando and Once to Anaheim and Paris in my opinion does not capture the Disney Magic but rather is a diluted version of it.Also the bus service to the hotels was appalling and very badly organized. The kids had a good time, but I wasnt too impressed.","Neutral"
"For me this truly is the happiest place on earth. Lovely rides but what makes this place so special is the athmosphere. Do check the website before you book to make sure not too many rides are closed due to renovations this year.","Positive"
"Oh dear, what have French managed to do to the magic of Disney? Firstly we love Disney so this is not a Disney knocking review and like a number of reviewers I would whole heartedly agree every child should get to visit Disney. Unfortunately, from the jewel of Europe in the 1990's Disney has sunk to an all time low with shops having very little merchandise, paint peeling from walls, no organisation at the main gate or bus station creating major risk to small children getting crushed in the push for both entrance and exit. However, they have maintained their high prices (Florida is also expensive don't let anyone tell you different) Back in the 1980's France was chosen and immediately the fears started to grow, these have now come home to roost, the staff now treat guests with distain and three of the main rides closed at the same time is poor planning on a park where there are so few rides anyway. The lack of shows to shelter from the winter weather is a major failure on the planners and the total lack of characters around the park embarrassing. Yes America is better, weather, size, etc but the big difference are the staff members who look like they are not serving a prison sentence. This is my fifth and final visit to Disney and Paris, what it had, it has lost. The most appalling part is having enter the park and then exit the park again to place your luggage in holding. On a positive note, the firework display out paced Florida and the castle is still the most beautiful of all the Disney parks. Get your paint brush out Walt.","Negative"
"Went to Disneyland the first weekend in January of 2014, and it is simply not what it used to be. I remember when it used to be about family entertainment, and now more and more the it shows that it is a corporate structure that shamelessly cares only about money and not about making the experience a happy one. It was really crowded, though I have been in worse. It should not be a place to go, where you have to think:  Is today going to be a really bad day, or will I be lucky for a change and not have to wait 45 minutes just to get in the front gate?  For a family of 4 (with 2 under nine) just your gate is going to cost you a significant amount of money ($356 1  day one park; $536 one day hopper; $674 2 day one day for each park). And, you have not paid to park, or for any food or lodging. Perhaps it would be nice if you did not have to wait in so many lines. First of the day the tram or the bus. Then, wait to pass through security. Then, wait to buy a ticket. Then, wait at the entrance to get in. Even if the park has just opened, there is still a significant wait. Each time you have to wait in line, you are giving up enjoyable ride time. If you are  too  early, you have to wait at the end of main street for the actual  opening  of the park. So, you have probably spend an hour just getting from your car to the first ride. Did I forget to remind you to go to the line (really short in the morning) to get a locker? And, I won't even address the line to get coffee at Starbucks, except to say the other place was better. Buy one cup and keep your receipt for free coffee refills all day, that beats out Starbucks. Ok. So, I lied, I did address it. Now onto the tips. So, you are at the end of main street    what to do next? If you like Star Tours, go there first and ride it three times in a row, if no line has formed. Then, move on to Space Mountain. Skip Captain EO and Innoventions. Save Autopia for later. While at Star Tours, if you are not going to Space Mountain, go do Buzz Lightyear. If you have smaller children, go to Fantasyland, and do Peter Pan (first if it is open) and be sure to look up at the window in Snow White for the Queen to look out. Then, on to Snow White (touch to the apple    sometimes you need to touch if a few times), Pinocchio and then, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. If you like Rapunzel, and it is open, this is the time to see her before the line gets too long, like her lovely locks. Then, onto Dumbo, Casey Jr. Train, Alice and the tea cups. Save Storybook land for night time. Then back to It's A Small World (at Christmas this is also one you want to do at night). Then, catch the train to New Orleans Square. Which way to go? Pirates, Haunted Mountain, and Pooh. If you like it do Splash Mountain. If you have young kids, you probably want to do Tom Sawyers to work off some energy. Now, it is time to think about food. Lunch, since you are close, you might want to try the Hungry Bear Restaurant, or any in New Orleans Square (Blue Bayou, Cafe Orleans, French Market or even the River Belle Terrace). No food in this place is economical, so if you have not brought your own, you are going to have to pay. You might even want to consider Rancho del Zacolo. You want to get the most food for your money. When dinner time comes around, you want to plan to sit in the outside of the Plaza Inn, so you can watch the fireworks. Well fed and what next? You still have some big rides, but you are full. So, take in the Mark Twain Boat, and you might even want to to a show at the Golden Horseshoe. Then, onto Thunder Mountain. Go back around to Fantasyland and do the Carousel and Peter Pan again. Then, onto the Matterhorn. If it is starting to get dark, do Storybook land or save it still for later. If you have really small kids and you want to do ToonTown, you can do it now. Then, catch the train again, and stop in Tomorrowland to do Autopia, Space Mountain if you want to do it again and Star Tours, the Submarine and peruse through the shops. You can even do Buzz again, and the Astro Orbiter. If you have timed it right, it should be getting dark. So, cross over to Adventure land and do the Jungle Cruise and Indiana Jones, and back to the Tiki Room. If you still have time and you have not done Storybook land, sneak around the back by the Matterhorn, and do it . Now, it should be time for dinner at the Plaza Inn. Food for adults and kids. We order one chicken dinner and split it. Get a salad and a cup of Italian dressing, and an extra cup to get extra gravy for the chicken dinner. Plus, I must have a dessert. Send someone out to find a table outside closer to the castle so you can have a view of the fireworks. If I am really hungry, someone also gets a cord dog to split. By, now it is time for shopping down main street. Do the left side first. Wander through all of the shops on that side and cross over to the Emporium and shop. Ice Cream at Gibson Girl?? Check out the hat shop last, and possibly visit Lincoln as your final attraction. You do not get to see the parades, but if you want squeeze them in. This trip does not include Fantasmic either, but you will have to save it for another day. If you are going to California Adventure, do Cars first and once again, and then to Soarin' Twilight Zone, if you like and then Crush Talk as many times in a row as possible. Ariel and Toystory are fun. Plus, all of the bug stuff is fun too. Not really much to do or see. Ice Cream at Ghiradeli? If you want to do the water show, you should dine at Carthay for lunch and get the  better  viewing tickets. Best tasting popcorn is near the Haunted Mountain. Sometimes the one on Main Street is burned. This is how I do it when I have large groups of people to take around. Bathrooms in Disneyland? Left and right side when you first enter Main Street. Behind the Plaza Inn near Star Tours. Near Alice. By the Mint Julep bar in New Orleans Square. Past Thunder BBQ towards Fantasyland. Keep those in mind during the day.","Neutral"
"The best close up fireworks I've ever seen in my travels.ONE thing to do here is to stay till 8.30 pm to watch fireworks! There are so many attractions and rides to play and see. I simply love watching the parades. Try going for all of them. Take a map and schedule of the shows with you or else you won't be able to catch up with time. Queues for the ride I'd say moderate given that I went on a Saturday afternoon. Don't expect too much for the indoor roller coaster rides. In my opinion, they were anti climax. I was expecting a slow ascend and quick drop  ( So I recommend going for all of the performances including the parades, Lion King, Stitch and etc.","Neutral"
"Having been to Disney in California, Florida and Paris (previously) my family and I were really disappointed with our recent visit back to Disneyland Paris. The queuing was horrendous (but is something you have to deal with) aggravated further by several ride malfunctions which meant waiting an hour for nothing. The 'fast pass' queues took as long as the normal queues and to make the situation worse the 'no smoking' rule was not followed or enforced which resulted in standing next to several people smoking and not having anywhere to go! We also made the mistake of eating in a couple of the Disney restaurants (The Steakhouse and Blue Lagoon) and apart from being overpriced and already inclusive of the tip, regardless on how good or bad the service was their special dietary offering was appalling. My wife is a Coeliac suffer and was offered a choice of 3 'microwave' meals (brought out still in there boxes!) as an alternative. It was only after some heated conversation and accommodating staff that we eventually managed to get her something 'freshly' prepared. All in all I would urge anybody thinking of going to Disney to maybe postpone and save up for a visit to Orlando rather than waste their money going to Disneyland Paris.","Negative"

"Everyone in the world knows about Disneyland. It is really one of the best places to have fun whether you are a kid or a kid at heart.There rides and shows for every age group and the place keeps improving and expanding. My favorites are Space Mountain at Tomorrow Land and Indiana Jones in Adventureland.I can't wait for Starwars Land to open.","Positive"
"Disneyland should limit the amount of people they admit each day. It cost roughly $400 for a family of 4 to go there and some of the lines are 1.5 hours long. This is crazy. I know everyone wants to take their kids there but do yourself a favour, go elsewhere","Negative"
"Me and my wife visited in the month of February where the weather in Hong Kong is a bit chilly. Unexpectedly, there was too much of rush and long long wait queues till afternoon despite being Monday . The rides were totally outstanding! It exceeded my expectations. My wige loved  Mystic Manor  . The tarzons house was under maintenance. Character meet had long queues.Definitely a place to visit in lifetime.","Positive"

"This was my fourth and last visit to Disneyland Paris. Last time I noted maintenance issues, mainly broken toilets. The good news is that toilets have not only been fixed but upgraded. But, the rest was a big, big disappointment. They still charge    90 at the gate to visit the two parks although great chunks of the park are closed for renovation. If you aim to go there to see Frontierland forget it, it's completely fenced off as are other attractions. I like to get my perspective of the park by travelling on the railway that goes through the different lands. Well, that was a waste of time. Two stations are closed and for a lot of the trip you are looking at a fence to hide the works that are being undertaken.And what about the parade? I used to enjoy the parade in the middle of the day. Now the parade is at 5.30, along with many others I was on my way home by then. For kids the parade is generally the highlight but I saw many parents on the train back to Paris, their kids were too tired to last until 5.30.On the upside, the Walt Disney Park next door was all open.","Negative"

"Went here for Xmas vacation with 2 adults, and 4 kids ranged (2 9). Rode most of rides. It was a fun experience but I have to say that if you want to see Disney, save your money and go to Disneyworld in Florida!!!We didn't see many characters thru out the park, except Pluto at Toon Town. How do you go to Disney and not see Mickey??? They have multiple parades thru out the day and each darn time the parade came the streets were roped off. Its A Small World was closed each time that parade came and when it reopened the line for that ride was ridiculously long!! Make your lines go a different way, but dont shut a ride down for a parade!!Came out of one ride and walked right into the roping off for another parade. We were ushered across the walk way and as we got to the other side, we stopped to turn around and watch parade. We were in an open walk area and not in the way of anyone. No people were around. Was approached by a Cast member who told us that we were not allowed to stand there and watch the parade. I literally thought I was being punked! What? I cant stand in an open area, not roped off and watch a parade?? I told him I paid just as money as anyone else to watch the parade and that I wasn't in the way and I refused to move. When I said that he said that the parades are first come, first serve and that if you aren't in a roped off area , then you couldn't stand and watch the parade. Seriously? I said that is ridiculous and I am not moving. So, he called security on us! I was so disgusted with him. I told him  Well, Merry Xmas to you too  and I started to walk away. He turned around and told me that he didnt celebrate Xmas....Let's just say  some of your staff are unprofessional and RUDE! If you are going to have 54 parades a day, you would think that this company could figure out a better way to incorporate people or at least lower the amount of parades then. Ww couldnt figure out how to get to some rides because of the parade routes being roped off. Had to backtrack thru half park for a small section of rides. When we were leaving, we couldnt figure out how to get out of park because everything was roped off and the KICKER was that everyone was blocking access to the sidewalks, and we couldnt get thru to leave the park. Now please tell me why that is ok???  and not ok for me when I was not blocking anyone??? Fix your parade routes and it would be better!","Neutral"
"We had a fantastic visit to the park there was plenty to see and do it took us a day and half to do the one park because there was that much to do.The parades are fantastic but were only twice and the main Disney parade was only on at 5pm The Disney dream show was amazing a must see we went twice to see it we enjoyed it that much.The only grumble was there was much choice for lunch we ended up eating hot dogs 2 out of the 4 days we visited.There plenty of restaurants for tea.

"After visiting Disney Orlando a couple of times we thought we would visit Disneyland Park as part of a West Coast trip. I agree with some of the recently posted reviews regarding waiting times as the cues were on the long side, probably average about 45 minutes. Although this parks is smaller than Orlando, the rides seamed to be longer with more attention to detail. I'm not sure if this is due to the different locations but the Disney staff weren't partially friendly here again compared to Orlando but don't let this put you off visiting if you're in the area.","Neutral"
"I normally go to Disneyworld Orlando every year bit thought I would try Disneyland Paris. I understand that it's smaller.(I've been to Disneyland California) I just wasn't impressed. Some of the staff are quite miserable. 5 rides were off during our stay so we felt there wasn't enough on to keep us entertained. The ques were herredous on the rides that were on. Overall I think Disneyland Paris is not worth the money. It needs to take a leaf out of Disneyworlds book ","Negative"
"Too small, too crowded, bad food.  Long lineups and some tourists are too eager and tried to jump the queue.","Negative"
"Well, if you  ve never been to a Disneyland, it  s worth going, so to have seen it. I remembered alot of the sttractions from my visist in FLorida and Los Angeles decades ago. The Design is nice. But from what I remember, the other Disney places are cleaner, always staff takiong care of rubbish, with that special charming Disney atmosphere. Not so in Paris.. We had 2 children with us, most of the time they were scared by the rides ( Pirates and Buzz Laser) So I would recommend it not for children under 7 8 years. They really liked Small world. All major attractions were working and waiting times were reasonable. Shuttle bus service was frequent and we never had to wait.Sadly there were never any characters around, except for the times in the program in the main square. That was what my son had been so looking forward too. There is no other word for the food: horrible and extremely overpriced.If you don  t want to live on tastless fries , ice cream , undefinable meat in susages etc. you just have to bring your own fruit and sandwiches. Food is extremely expensive in side and outside the park.Luckily before our arrival we went to a large supermarket ( eg carrefour) and bought fresh bread and produce, cheese and coldcuts.We ate at the Steakhouse in Disney village. A kids menu around 12 Euro, with the chesseburger consisting of nothing but the bun and cheese and meat. No ketchup or salad or tomato. The chocolate pudding for dessert tasting burnt. I had a steak that reminded me more of the sole of a shoe, the side salad having about 3 drops of dressing. Service is slow, and not very personal.You just always have the feeling, all they want is your money with the least effort they can get bye.SO, I would recommend Disneyland to someone really wanting to go, with preparation to the things stated above. But I personally do not feel the urge to go again in the near future. There are so many other palces in Europe to see...","Neutral"
"Stayed with Wife and Daughter (11) for birthday of Daughter and beginning of half term. We have never done Disney before, so were not sure where to stay or what to expect. Very disappointed, I'll try and be as informative as I can, without ranting or going on. Sequoia Lodge Montana Lake View, 4134 was quiet and clean, but very basic. The 'continental' breakfast only offers children's cereals, bread and pastry, processed meat and cheese. Nothing with any protein in it. We sacked breakfast in search of some eggs ! If you want eggs or something hot you need to upgrade. Sequoia wasn't our cup of tea, we should have spent a bit more money and tried one of the better options, but you don't come here for the hotel, do you !Which leads me on !!!Again   first time here, so not sure what to expect !15 rides closed for 'maintenance'. Really !!!!Basically you may spend 5 days walking from Space Mountain to Indiana Jones. (One of which closes next week !!) If you have a child who likes thrills and not fluffy princesses. The shows are outstanding. We saw The Lighting McQueen Stunt Show twice. Buffalo Bill Wild West show, The Parades and the characters. Top quality with clearly talented individuals taking part. Birthday dinner at Cafe Mickey. Usual food choices but very pleased with time spent with Daughter by Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and Pluto. Well run by their 'Manager' !!The few rides that were open were amazing. Top quality and well run. If you like your food choices to consist of saturated fat, salt, sugars and carb loaded   then you're in for a treat! If you want healthy then you may well have to try the one or two restaurants in the Village that sell a salad. After an hour of queuing, of course! We had a lovely meal, that wasn't deep fried, at the steakhouse on our first night. We tried to return on our last night to a 2.5hr wait!! Joke!! The park was half empty as it had been chucking it down all day! On the plus side   it rained, and rained and rained. Which meant that, when the working rides weren't closed for fear of lightning strikes (or whatever)   there were hardly any queues. So we didn't need our Fast Passes   which only appear to be valid as and when the park chooses !!!Beat the queues by using the single rider option. Most of the time you get with a chum anyway and the wait is a fraction of the alternative. If you stay at one of the Park hotels, you get early access from 0800. They omit to inform you that it's only a small part that is actually open. Most of it ain't!!Again, not sure if regular users would beg to differ on that. But it was our perception. By the way ! If you want a gluten free (don't judge !!) menu at Buffalo Bills Show, think again. The option is worse that baby food. The children's chicken and potatoes would have been perfect instead of the aeroplane slop they gave my wife! Planet Hollywood offered a superb gluten free menu though. But after an hour and a half wait to be seated and served   we sacked it ! Ok, so maybe I ranted a bit and did 'go on' but I expect more from the Disney Brand. Please don't judge us. We're not usually this weary !! Our Daughter certainly enjoyed herself and that's all that mattered but I'll not be giving them a second chance. Sorry. .","Negative"
"Disneyland Paris was a huge let down. Probably a case of too much expectations maybe. Had been to Universal studios in Singapore and my kids aged 10 and 6 enjoyed that experience much better and so did we.The rides are all average. Our visit was in a good time of the year   in May. Tips: Buy online tickets of course. There are two parks. The Walt Disney Studios Park closes early. So be sure to finish off all you want there first.The Disney parade was nice. Be sure to get a good vantage point early if you want to have a good view.","Negative"

"We went on a regular Friday around 11am under the cloudy sky. Not many people & we needed max 10 min for a ride if there was a line. Some ride we went 2, 3 times in a row without waiting at all, unbelievable!!!I went to Disney Tokyo & Paris, it's smaller. Good if you have smaller kids. Main languages are Cantonese, English & Mandarin.Now it's not allowed to use the selfie stick in the park & I don't see clear indication at the door. The staff sometime screamed at the microphone for some people who didn't understand & the people were really crazy, ignored them too...Toilets are everywhere & it's very clean with staff often cleaning. Souvenir shops are at all the corners waiting for you to spend money.Baby facilities available. Can leave the pushchair just outside the attraction in a special area, sometimes there is someone keep an eye of the area.Last year I went into Space mountain with my 6 year son then, without knowing how it was exactly, however I've asked if he's allowed to go on & he was tall enough, & we would be sitting next to each other. Anyway, it was so scary that I thought he would fly out of the car anytime. This time the Ironman area was built. We visited the Ironman experience. We took our time to ask questions & got detailed answer. If I'm not wrong, there are 4 (cinema liked) rooms, this means less waiting time. It was a tour visit of HK but with Ironman & monster in between, 3D, air, chair moving experience. Nice atmosphere with everyone was laughing & screaming.The ride is fairly short, a min or 2. Sometime the staff spent so much time to check all the doors were closed & secure than the ride.Moneywise, I found it's quite expensive for the daily extrance fee (1 Adult HKD 589) , as well the food, a simple meal easily cost HKD 100. There is a 2 days' pass which you can use 2 times within 7 days period, that's much more interesting (1 Adult HKD 759)Overall, if you're well prepared, it would be a pretty good experience with your kids.","Positive"
"I went with a large group of family, but split into 2 groups. This was excellent because the men in their 30s and 40s did not want to go through the Princess Castle! One of our group members was from LA, and knew how to navigate through the park. We utilized the Fast Pass option when we could. It can be a very expensive day but you can bring bottled water with you which I highly recommend. We ate lunch at the barbecue place which was served family style and quite tasty. Ribs were close to being perfect!! I was exhausted at the end of the day and had difficulty getting out of the car once we arrived to the hotel. Not a spring chicken anymore! I think it would have been fun to stay in the resort area and spend a few days there, as we were not able to visit California Adventureland next door.","Positive"
"I last visited Disneyland Paris around 15 years ago when I was in my early 20's and went back last week for as part of my birthday in Paris to find very little had changed. I was a little bit surprised to arrive at Marnee le Vallee RER station to find armed soldiers patrolling the station, I'm told this isn't unusual as MLV is a stop for the Eurostar so they have keep an eye on those entering France at MLV but for those younger ones in your group it can be a little unnerving. The RER station is smack bang in front of the main gates and takes just a few minutes to walk across and into Disney. It is a special feeling when you walk into Disney for the first time so make the most of it. I like that the park is clean and tidy and you can walk from one to the other in 15 minutes, it's actually rather small so quite deceptive. I LOVED meeting Mickey Mouse, we queued for around 40 minutes but whilst you queue you can watch old MM cartoons which I just loved, and so did the children in the queue. There is a photographer to take your photo but she was happy to take photos using our own cameras which I thought was quite nice. The parades are colourful and well worth taking time out to watch. What I didn't like was the constant music, there isn't a place in the park where you can just chill and relax as they pump through Disney music all day so after a while it can all get a little too much. Now as a girl who likes to shop the shop's were very disappointing, each one is stocked with exactly the same items with hardly any variations. Don't expect to buy things for other Disney stories or characters it really is all about Mickey and Minnie so for a girl who loves Tigger it was disappointing to find just one pair of Tigger ears with hardly anything else to buy. Disney really are missing a trick here and should consider extending their range. They also ask that you don't picnic in the park and as such areas to sit and eat something you've brought in really do not exist which I felt is a shame as if you have younger children in your group you may want to take some time out for them, and you, to have a break.","Positive"
"Thanks to HK's efficient MTR system, this place is very easy to reach. Go there at least 45 minutes before opening because by opening time, there's already a huge build up of people waiting for the  flood gates  to open. And when they do, people run toward the most popular rides to try to beat each other out of the line. Our first ride was the Iron Man Experience   careful, lots of motion in this 3D theater but fun. If you can, plan for a two day visit to make the most of the park especially if you have kids in tow. My favorite experience was  The Lion King Show . Don't miss this for anything else there. Also, if you can purchase food vouchers inclusive of your tickets, do so. I did two meals and a snack   for each of my family members and I'm glad I did because we planned and did stay there from start to finish. This was a better way to save money than having to purchase individual meals there.That said, for next time, we would just buy one meal (preferably dinner that is redeemable after 4:30 PM) and a snack (a choice of popcorn or ice cream stick anytime) for each person and just eat a heavy breakfast before leaving home or hotel. My favorite meal was the  Singapore Laksa Noodle Soup  at the Tahitian Terrace (you can redeem vouchers at other restaurants as well). The Indian Tandoori Chicken meal was  blah .As for the fireworks display, try to position yourself somewhere in the Rotunda of the Main Street to have the best view of the fireworks when they conclude the day. If you have kids (or you're a kid at heart) ask the attendants for stickers, even the janitors themselves happily give them out for collecting. And, bring a water bottle. Drinking fountains are a bit scarce there (there's one by the Iron Man Experience) out that's the way to stay hydrated and saving money at the same time. If you're used to Disneyland in California and Florida, don't expect the cast to be as friendly. They are, just not U.S. Disney friendly. At least that's my personal opinion. Enjoy!","Positive"
"Don't waste your time with Euro Disney, it does not compare to the Disney parks in Florida and California.  The staff were unfriendly, rude and not at all interested in customers!  If you do not speak French, you are ignored!","Negative"

"Its by far the saddest disneyland i went to, it is mainly due to the majority of things to do are closed for renovation and new things still under construction, such a wrong timing for me to come. Disneyland Honkgkong vibe was way way wayyyyy better from the music to rides to Mickey. Even the entrance is under renovation, hope they find their spark once again after all the renovations.","Negative"
"We decided to take our 6 year old for a long weekend. I must say we are very disappointed with the experience in general. Whilst I appreciate it was school holidays and the crowds were huge, I cannot see the value in paying so much for passes when actually you are likely not even to make it to 10 attractions over 2 days because of the queues. Some of the attractions were closed for renovation and others just look very tired and dated. The staff are poorly trained and for both days we were sent on a goose chase for our tickets because we had some vouchers. On day one we queued for over an hour!. We had downloaded the passes to our phones and one would expect that just like your plane ticket this should work at the barrier but no it didn   t! Leading us to queue at three different queues as none of the staff was trained enough to to know what to do. On the first day after what felt like endless hours queuing we were given tickets for    both days   , except this was not the case so the same drama the second day, another 70 minutes of queuing. This put us on a back foot for both days meaning we only had limited time and endless queues to endure before we could visit any attraction. The place is also VERY EXPENSIVE for the most basic things i.e. food I paid    37 or so for a meal of fries, a small bottle of water and a fish burger, 1 small portion of fries and 4 chicken nuggets. On day two we decided to leave the park and eat at one of the restaurants by he entrance. It was much more reasonable, it was proper food and peaceful. Merchandise is also cheap and tacky but EXPENSIVE!. We also stayed in a vacation club and not at Disney. This was a great choice away from all tack at Disney.The marvel attractions were ok but they had technical glitches and the queues horrendous. The parade was so busy the little 6 year old could hardly see anything. I know people were queuing since 4 pm for the 5.30 pm parade (what a waste of a day). Same with the fireworks we turned up at 9 ish to find a good patch but taller selfish people just walked in and stood in front of us again he couldn   t see much. I must add that not once did we see Mickey or Minnie except on the float or if we were prepared to queue for ages or book some silly breakfast (more money) with the characters. Why couldn   t they just have a few of these characters meeting and greeting children?. Their app is not very good and doesn   t give much info nor is it interactive enough. Information in general is sketchy unless you sit there planning for weeks. I think if you are a regular or know how to play the game you   d be ok. This is not a destination of once in a life time for a 6 yr old. There is no room for spontaneity. In general I felt we could have holidayed in Africa and seen real lions or the Caribbean and enjoyed the beaches for a better experience for the amount of money we paid. This was just a very tacky, dirty and over priced experience for very little return. I feel the place is so commercial (money, money, money)that the spirit of the magic is lost!","Negative"
"Indeed the Hongkong Disneyland is a good experience specially the parade and the fireworks. Most of the rides were really made for kids. Some of it I got bored. Three times we fell in line and after waiting for sometime they told us there is a technical problem.Can be access by MTR.Regarding food, yes, it is expensive. But, there is a fast food inside near the Marvel area that sells 2pc chicken, 1 rice, 1 drink, and fries for 99hkd. The chicken are relatively big so you can just buy another rice and drink and make the meal for two.They will search your belongings if there are food.Recommended time to use here is opening till fireworks.","Positive"
"I have been going to Disneyland ever since I was a child and now that I am an adult, I still try to go every year or every other year. I have nothing but good memories of Disneyland and California Adventure. I have been to Disney World in Orlando and although the sheer size of all the parks is amazing and something that I definitely recommend for any Disney lover, there is something special about the closeness of Disneyland over Disney World. Not to mention, it's the original. ;) Everyone should visit Disneyland at least once in their life!","Positive"
"Recently took our daughter there as a surprise for her 21st Birthday she was given a badge when we arrived and all the staff and characters made a fuss of her. Having been the Disney parks in the USA this is quite small, it was not peak time so the waiting time for the rides was only 5  10 mins. They was a lack of Characters around that you could have a photo with which was a shame. Other than that it had the same 'Disney Magic' and we had an amazing day.","Positive"
"Okay experience overall! However wasn't for the ages 12  as most of the rides and attractions was targeted for younger children. However if you are 12  and like that sort of thing then go for it! Very expensive to purchase anything there so make sure to buy and pack food in advance to save money. ","Neutral"
"This review relates to a visit to Disneyland Paris between Christmas and New Year. Overall, I was disappointed that my expectations were not met and I felt the experience was sadly lacking in a number of areas which I feel must be rectified if the Disney brand is to maintain its reputation and indeed, it's integrity.This was my third visit to the Paris resort (I have also been to the Florida resort twice). Visiting between Christmas and New Year I had high expectations from the Disney magic I have become used to. I have to say that many aspects did live up these   the huge Christmas tree and decorations were stunning and the snowstorm was enchanting. However, I found the crowds to be unbelievable   surely there comes a point when the Disney experience takes precedence over corporate greed? The problems of so many people crowding into a finite space and all jostling for a relatively small number of attractions was exacerbated by the lack of control by Disney staff. In general, there were not enough staff available, particularly at night and in many cases, staff didn't seem interested or bothered about the visitors   one example of this was when we boarded the Disney Railroad train at the Discoveryland Station. When the train pulled into Main Street, many people got off, and my party of three people had a carriage to ourselves. No staff bothered to check numbers of empty seats, so the train pulled out of the station leaving an enormous queue, which my experience suggests would have included people who have already been waiting for more than an hour. Unfortunately, this laissez faire attitude prevails amongst the staff   we went to watch the EO show, which turned into a farcical waste of time. Having queued to get in and been forced to stand up through a 10 minute advert and boring  making of...  documentary (not welcome having been standing up in the queue outside for some time), we were eventually herded through to the auditorium. After several minutes a staff member appeared on stage to tell us rather rudely that the film would not be going ahead and that we were required to leave. No apologies or explanation were offered at all.We had planned to use our Fast Pass on the Big Thunder Mountain train   until we saw that it had broken down halfway up the mountain and that those people on board had to get out and walk back. Other substandard rides included the Phantom Manor, where the cars stop unexpectedly;  was also the case for the Snow White ride. The Buzz Lightyear ride was good, but the experience somewhat spoilt by the shabbiness of the areas leading into the ride itself, with litter and mud across the floor. We also stood in a queue for the Toy Soldiers Parachute drop, watching people carefully sidestep a pool of vomit for around forty minutes, which staff evidently could not be bothered to clear or cover up. I would very much have liked to have been able to comment on the Crush's coaster   unfortunately the two hour queues every time I attempted it prevented me from experiencing it   again, far too many people.There was a high volume of litter throughout the resort, which is not something I would expect of Disneyland. The regular  parade  was a bit pathetic with only one float and a few dancers and information relating to the daily shows and other events was simply not widely available   and again, there were no staff around to ask especially in the evening. Even if there had been, I probably wouldn't have been able to see them as there were so many missing   broken street lights around the main square.Finally, I found the excessive pricing throughout the resort to be shocking in the current economic climate. As stated, I have visited this resort twice before, so knew what to expect, but feel that prices have soared, while in the case of the Blue Lagoon restaurant, quality has declined and my top priced set menu main course was inedible and returned to the kitchen. Some other examples of rip off prices are 12 euros for a cocktail, 30 euros for a child's nightdress and 3.50 euros for a small carton of popcorn   these prices have got to be amongst the highest anywhere in the world!","Neutral"
"We recently went to Balboa Island on vacation with the family. We also have never been to California but figured since we were so close that visiting Disneyland was a MUST!. We went in February which was off season and everything was just okay. It was so overcrowded. Even being offseason, i can't imagine what the busy season looks like or how you could even function.Everyone is packed together and the park is pretty outdated and it shows. For the amount of money Disney brings in and charges they should be ashamed of the condition of the park. Just slapping new paint on old rides and giving it a new name. I know its a type of marketing and branding but the park size is just way to small for the amount of people to go in there.People are rude, My daughter and wife got puked on by some guy getting off a ride at the park. Ive also been to Disney world as we are from the east coast. If you are reading this based on choosing... Go there. its the same cooperate structure but it is far larger and superior as parks go. If I had a choice now i would have gone to knox berry farms instead.","Negative"

"16th June 2012Recent 11 day visit to the parks with my family. When you consider this was the 20th Anniversary you would have expected everything to be working and in good order     wouldn   t you?Disney StudioThe Backlot Tram was out of action for several days.The Toy Soldier Parachutes were out of action for several days and then broke down again.Armageddon was not operational for several days.Elements of other rides were dysfunctional and either closed off or covered.There exists a ban on smoking in public in France which is totally ignored in the Studio.Disneyland ParkMany smaller cafes and restaurants around the park were closed or completely shut. The Carousel was closed for several days.There were several elements of other attractions either broken or not working, e.g. Small World.The shows have been reduced greatly and there are very few left.Likewise, the parades are reduced in number and length.There exists a ban on smoking in public in France which is totally ignored in the Disneyland Park.The moving walkway approaches to the park are either not working at all or only some of the time, with repairs in progress on others, often, the direction you want to travel in is non operational.The pushing in by the local populace is as bad as it ever was; you face strategic blocking in the queues to retain your space.We had one or two heated moments during our visit which you do not experience in the US. The extra    Magic Hours    are a complete waste of time, only one small area is open in Fantasyland and not all the rides were operating! Some of the toilets were disgusting and obviously not cleaned. Food is dearer wherever you go in the park.And FinallyThis will be my last visit to this resort, not because of age, ailment, ability or financial limitation, but because I am sick of the rude, arrogant, pushy, ignorant foreigners that proliferate in this place. Instead I will be going to the US at the earliest opportunity for my next visit where they are more friendly, fun, polite and courteous to each other.I feel the Disney Empire may soon lose the    French connection    and the support of the many influential businesses that put their name to Disneyland Paris e.g. Lever Bros; it   s going down the pan, just like its currency. I wonder if Disney USA are aware?","Neutral"
"I visited here for the day with my husband, mother and 2 children. It was a very hot day, and so understandably there were few characters walking around. The rides were fine, but none really stand out for me   certainly undeserving of the hype they receive   I much prefer those in the theme parks in England. I accept you pay a premium for food and drink in these types of places   but this was just too much. 6 euros for a sausage in a bun without sauce or onions is too much in my opinion. Drinks were also very expensive and warm. I think this is a very over hyped attraction.","Negative"

"Our visit to Disneyland was so that our grandsons could  meet  the characters that they know from TV and movies. They loved every ride that they were on, though we didn't make it to all of the rides during our 2 days in the park.

We managed to snag a prime spot for the Electric Parade on our 2nd night and were thankful for the front row view.","Positive"
"It was great to feed the inner child by visiting Disneyland Paris. Opening at 10 am we arrived when the crowds were not too big   though they grew to huge by afternoon. Being in the senior age range the only rides we went on were the train rides around the park! There was a long queue for the paddle steamer so we didn't wait around for that, but it would have been nice. The food was mostly take away style: burgers, chips and Coke but considering that the park is sponsored by Coca Cola ..... The ice cream parlour was worth the visit   ice cream to die for! Security was mildly evident with armed soldiers patrolling the entrance, and Security Guards with dogs discreetly placed around the park.","Positive"

"As it was our first time in LA we took the kids to Disney. Had a great time but was disappointed we didn't get on a few more rides. The queues were just too long and the day isn't long enough to get on everything. After visiting Florida Disney on many occasions over the last 30 years we were slightly disappointed with this park. Although most of the rides are the same the park seems much smaller and crushed in. The best thing about it was the queues were easier to bear as the temperatures are lower in CA than FL.","Neutral"
"We did it so the children can tick it off. Would I ever recommend it   no unless I lived in Hong Kong.It is beautifully landscaped and clean and easy to get to. Apart from that it is aimed at sub 8yo I would guess and for that it is well done. It is Disney it's expensive for all things   entry,memorabilia and food.Buy tickets online,it helps a bit. We deliberately avoided the weekend so the queues were tolerable.There are other theme parks more worthy in Hong Kong.","Negative"

"Having visited Disneyland Florida quite a few times which is exceptional, this park is a let down commercially and financially.Compared to florida this park is minuscule and when you have rides that are closed for maintenance which as Disney says  we are sorry that this ride is closed for essential maintenance and we hope it doesn't detract from your enjoyment etc etc .... .well yes it bloody does thank you .  Im only here for 4 days and I'm not coming back so yes it really pee me off .So now with the closure of Thunder mountain and Dumbo the park has lost its best rides so I may as well gone to Alton towers!You can go round the whole park in a day so to suffer 4 days going on the same rides was tedious to say the least, couple this with the rip off prices and you leave the park feeling as though you have been mugged literally.15 euros for a baseball cap, 8 euros for a slush puppie, etc. This wouldn't be so bad if you were on your own but when you have kids with you it soon starts to mount up.If you eat outside the park, apart from mcDees the prices are astronomical and to be honest you are in the middle of nowhere so you have to pay the going rate I'm afraid.I will be frank with you all out there, after you have paid for the trip and the food you may just as well go to the travel agent and go to florida for 2 weeks instead and I bet you the price difference will be negligible and you will enjoy USA much more than Paris. Bigger, Better and Cheaper","Neutral"

"Today I was severely mistreated while entering Disneyland. With an e cigarette that security threatened to confiscate and not let me return into the park. Forcing me to surrender legal Juul pods and device you can buy at 7 11. The first cast member asked me if it's medically necessary. As a registered nurse, I said automatically said yes. She proceeded to tell me they will confiscate my device so I walked away.Came back and the second cast member asked what'd I do with it. I said I threw it out. He then SCREAMED at me, pointing at me, following me, threatening for me to get it out of the garbage. OUT OF THE GARBAGE!! I ran away telling him to back off.Went back and the sheriff proceeded to me and said I had to surrender my LEGAL Juul e cigarette and they will throw it away. They will not return it. He threatened me saying I will not be allowed to return into the park. Took the device and pods. I explained it was just nicotine, sold at 7 11, showed the website, and that they let people with cigarettes and lighters in the park. He took a picture of my driver's license and park ticket. He eventually gave me back the device and later realized the pods were legally just nicotine. Gave those back too.I'm very very disappointed in the mistreatment, multiple threats and harassment at Disney security. As if this was a vape with CBD oil. It's not. There are smoking areas in the park for crying out loud. This is my 4th day out of 5 days. If it weren't for my 4 year old son in a stroller, I'd never come back to this place again. A waste of an hour of my time.","Negative"
"the facilities were very neat. good for kids, it could use more attraction, the time i was there was cold so I had to ride the the facilities just to get warm dont leave before the fireworks its a must see awsome","Positive"
"Let me preface this review by stating that I love Disney. I spend a great deal of time visiting the Most Magical Place on Earth and have gotten to the point where my family rolls their collective eyes at the mere suggestion of heading to  my most favorite place on Earth.  That being said, going to Disneyland Paris is another experience. If you have ever been to Disneyland or Disneyworld, you will be disappointed with Disneyland Paris. It is a smaller park (read MUCH smaller) and during my visit, many of the attractions were shut down for renovations. What I failed to understand is how it was possible that smoking was allowed all over the park as long as you are not standing under a covered entranceway. This was very shocking and annoying but it's Europe and there is a different standard. Disneyland Paris has a few attractions that are not in the states, Crush Coaster (AWESOME!) and Ratatouille (OK but not really worth the wait). It is very expensive to come so be prepared to spend some Euro especially if you are eating in the park. The cast members are multilingual and are courteous. Overall, I enjoyed my day there as I knew not to have high expectations and not to compare it to what is available stateside. Taken on it's own, if you can get discounted tickets and or a pass, it's a good way to spend a day.","Neutral"
"Over $300 for a family of 3 to simply walk through the entrance gate. Gates opened at 10am, rides not open operating until after 1pm? Eurodisney offers a FAST TRACK ticket system for the rides   after you ride once, you can re line up in a shorter, fast track queue, for a 2nd ride without going to the back of original queue  this visit, you were requested to obtain your fast track ticket before the first ride; but had to wait over 3hrs to get onto a rollercoaster ride, some rides up,to 5hrs. If you enjoy a Cheese burger or Angus burger, similar to Mcdonalds, be prepared to pay    7 8 euro ($12) for one, fries    3.5 ($6) or you can get a meal deal for    14 ($25), and wait 40mins to be served. Overall, if you have lots of patience, like being overcharged, enjoy standing in long lines, (rides, food and toilets), like very short rides, then this is the place for you to enjoy a family day out.","Negative"
"I feel there are more shops than rides in the park and you can tell that it's the first one I have been to Florida and found that the Disney park there was far superior to this it was ok a couple of the rides went fast I feel that this particular one has more geared up for young children then for couples also when we went some of the new attractions were not open despite having a schedule to say that they would be","Neutral"
"My second visit. Still as fun n happy. Disappointed by the breakdown of Rodney ride and Huanted House. Extremely disappointed that the firework at the castle was cancelled due to strong wind. I didn't get to watch the fireworks show the other time for the same reason. ","Neutral"
"We love Disneyland every time we visit! The most magical place in the world. We'll be visiting again soon!","Positive"
"We couldn't fault Disneyland Park. There is something for everyone.. The rides are great fun and we love the different lands.  It is so clean and easy to get around. The food outlets are good too.","Positive"
"Knowing how amazing Disney can be, we booked our tickets a while back to take two young teenaged girls. This trip was super disappointing for various reasons, and before you go, you should know... Space Mountain ride was down for most of the day, Matterhorn ride was down after an hour of waiting in line, no fireworks due to construction on site, no parade due to construction on site, extremely overcrowded (as per usual), Haunted House ride stopped for 30 minutes while we were riding, Indiana Jones ride closed when we had our fastpasses, and in general, no theme characters in site no matter where we looked, and walked away from young kids waiting for autographs. After complaining to a park member services staff, we did get two fastpass rides added to our tickets (he was lovely and apologetic). In general the staff are very unfriendly also. Castle is half the size of Orlando's Disneyworld. As per usual, the souvenirs, hoodies, food is all over priced. As Canadians, we spent well over $1200 for a day that definitely missed the Disney mark.","Negative"
"I was speechless when I arrived, even when I had yet to enter the disneyland. The other tourists around me were yelling at the top of their voices in the mtr, totally oblivious to the fact that it was a shared space and it was one of the most headache inducing 15 min of my life. When we queued to enter, I was shoved and nobody seemed to care that they had pushed someone. I mean.. what's the rush if everyone got a ticket. The facilities were decent and I thought they would have been good if they attracted more civilised culture to the area. Toilets were beyond gross and wet. Food was decent, but I would rather fly to Japan for their Disneyland than fight it out with this bunch here.","Negative"
"I recommend the fast pass for the rides. Give your self at least 2 days to visit.The parade was great.We loved it. The stores are full of beautiful things.I can wait for my daughter to grow and take her there.","Positive"
"We were very disappointed to not have wifi. As an International traveller we need wifi to communicate with each other or to access Disney App.We were surprised because seaworld, San Diego zoo, Universal Studios all have free wifi Another huge disappointment for us was the Character lines. Our daughters stood in line for sometime 20mins only to watch the character leave before we had a chance to take a picture. Unfortunately this happened to us a 4 or 5 times. We started to ask the character guide what the schedule was. There should be someone at the end telling people when they are leaving.","Neutral"
"While I would say this park is a little smaller than Disneyland in Anaheim, CA, it is on par as far as the attractions go. I did not see anything unique to Paris.My one observation is that I have never seen a Disney bathroom in such bad condition. We have been to 3 different parks now and I was very surprised at the paper on the floor, big puddles everywhere, broken toilets. The park was not crowded at all, so I could not see a reason for this.Also, the food venues are not as plentiful as other parks I have visited. The park was not crowded but all the sit down restaurants were fully booked and many of the walk in places were closed and sparse.","Neutral"
"Little girls may love this place, but not my 2 boys, aged 7 and 11. They didn't really enjoy it. Weather was extremely hot. The park was super crowded. The queue was super duper long. Its kinda boring. Its the same parade every single day....More","Neutral"
"Grad days got us too.Wait times were horrendous , waiting 45 minutes for a 3 minute ride.But it was the staff were indifferent and quite rude , waiting in the mid of a walk way (by a show) so my people could see me and was asked to move on three times. Then letting other people push in in lines etc , had enough by lunchtime .... some of the rides have been updated brilliantly   peter pans flight was wonderful , still similar but sparklerer .Also disapointed about no fireworks during windy nights. Both parks shows are really badly run , should have an ampetheatre, i wouldnt do it again , and that theres even a queue to meet the characters , and if you stop them for a pic they were quite rude. (mary poppins even)","Negative"
"Although we really enjoyed the trip we were disappointed at the high ticket price when the majority of the rides were closed. ","Neutral"
"A good day out which tired kids out, but unfortunately did not have time to do much due to queues and waiting around.  Been there, done it probably would not choose to go back, especially for the price(s).","Neutral"
"Loved our time here, and although I found out my children didn't like roller coasters ( where as I love them) there were plenty of other smaller rides to keep them entertained. Several of the rides here were closed (maybe this was due to the timing of our trip) but it was a pain only to find this out after walking to the area.Having the different shopping areas I was a bit disappointed that they ALL mainly stocked the same things. Being on a budget it was great that they had certain offers on in the shops where if you spent so much you could get another item at a lower price. (bearing in mind that you can buy items on the Disney website cheaper)Due to being on a budget it came as a shock that you had to pay for an overpriced autograph book and then wait around to get a picture with the 'Disney character' we decided to give it a miss. luckily I managed to get a couple of photos of my own of a couple characters as we were in the 'right place at the right time'The light show was fantastic and was enjoyed by all and was definitely worth more than one visit to see.My main downfall for this was the parade, as it being nearly 3 4 deep of people, we had to be there at least an hour early to ensure a decent view of the parade Also there were many adults (some without small children) that stood at the front of the path that blocked the view of the passing floats, and attending with 2 children as a single parent was only able to hold up one, whilst the other missed most of what was going on. (maybe Disney can come up with a better way of how this can be facilitated) However It was only later during our visit we found out that there was a designated area for people with disability)All in all although I would never go to Disneyland Paris again I would consider America.","Positive"
"I recently reviewed Universal Studios in Singapore, and I just thought I'd review the one that I compared USS with. I went here before I even went to Universal Studios, and I found it more cheerful, to say the least, to commute to HK Disneyland because of their very own train   windows shaped like mickey's ears included. Going to Disneyland, and going home from it, were easy   they have their own MRT line. One plus, I think, of HK Disneyland is that the tickets are very much accessible   we purchased ours in a convenience store near where we were staying. Getting to the amusement park was a bit longer than it should have been, there was an unnecessary walk from the train drop off to the entrance of the amusement park itself. The lawn bushes that were shaped like the Disney characters did not help at all in lifting our energies up. However, when we got there, we were pretty anxious already. What I did not like the most in HK Disneyland was not the long queues for the rides, but the long queues for the photo ops with the Disney characters. As compared Universal Studios, they only had photo ops in ONE area in HK disneyland   so pretty much every person who wanted a picture flocked there. We ended up having a picture with just Goofy because of all the lines. I will not write about the rides because of the different preferences of the people, but I can say that HK does a so so job in catering to the preferences of the guests. The rides had long queues, and there were not enough rides to divide the people's attention. With the expansion of the Toy Story area, I hope that HK Disneyland continues with the expansion so that it would cater to the daily traffic that they received. I read somewhere that HK Disneyland is operating at a loss, and I can see why. There was just simply not enough rides to make people go back.  Happiest place on Earth     for just one day. The parade, however, somewhat made the entrance fee worth it as this America imported amusement park does not disappoint with the parade. It was very much lively, and it featured all the characters that people were expecting to see. The parade participants that weren't on the floats were even interacting with the guests with unending charisma all throughout the parade. As compared to Universal Studios in Singapore, the souvenir stores here are priced decently. They had adorable items   but I think thats just because Disney characters are an easier sell as compared to random characters from Universal Studios. Rides, however, are a totally different story; as I mentioned earlier. The one thing that made all that walking worthwhile was the fireworks display that happens promptly at 7PM. You'll see people flocking Cinderella's castle because the view is best from there. It did not disappoint as the famous Disneyland fireworks display was simply breathtaking. If it's anything, simply go to Disneyland in the afternoon and wait for the display! All in all, Hong Kong's disneyland was an okay attraction. However, as I mentioned, I think its something I will visit just once in my life   not unless they expand beyond the Toy Story land.","Neutral"
"Last Saturday evening we had fast pass tickets to see Peter Pan from 7.40pm 8.10pm. We got to the ride at 7.38pm. There was a handful of people in the fast track queue. It was raining, we couldn   t see anyone at the start of the area so went under rope. Then a Disney employees ran and shouted at us to go to the front of the way in. Her manner was so rude and confrontational. We showed our tickets and she said we had to wait. There was no one else there and it was raining. But apparently we had to wait two minutes. When my clock turned to 7.40 we went to the front of the way in. She shouted literally it wasn   t time yet. I showed her my iPhone with the correct time on, she waved her watch in front of my face saying her watch was right. I said my clock was correct. She then shouted more irrelevant things. She can right up to my face in front of loads of people in the line for Peter Pan. People were turning round because of her shouting. I then said I was going to talk to her manager about her behaviour. She then grabbed her badge and waved that in front of my face and spelt out her name in her shouting voice as well. She looked so unprofessional, rude and nasty. She should not be working with the public, with that attitude. She was rude to people on another ride the night before. We were a family of 5 and she treated us like absolutely rubbish. We have been twice this year to Disneyland Paris and overall 9 times and have never ever been treated or spoke to this way. I have the persons name if Disney would like to know this information. She certainly doesn   t have the Disney spirit all the other employees possess.","Negative"
"disneyland is the happiest place on earth. It should include the maxpass with the ticket prices. It is a money grab and I don't like that. Moblie oredinrg was cool on the app. They should also have more vegy, fresh food options like California adventure. hey have very few and I went to one and it was closing right in the middle of the day and the next one was so far away.","Positive"
"We went here as an early birthday present as I have a landmark birthday so we wanted to do something with the kids we haven't done yet .The park was magical to look at but my heart sank as we entered as it was rammed ,I've never ever been anywhere with so many people in it was overwhelming at times .It was decorated in a Halloween theme and it was so pretty and so disney .The main street had lots of disney like cartoon ghost statue things and spooky cartoon laughter .One thing did disturbe me though a poor white horse was seen pulling a cart thing and it was slipping all over the road and he looked like he was struggling ,I'm sure this was not needed in a place like this .We the entered the princess's castle and again Halloween theme prevailed with a smoking dragon thorn bush thing where my kids had a photo with Mallificent which we qued a best part of hour for but she was great really in character .We then went to go to the rides ,we qued for nearly 75 mins for the dumbo ride and it was like this the whole time ,getting onto 2 hour waits sometimes this I find is shocking for a well known park like disney that people have saved hard to visit and not at all magical for the little ones ,the children were crying in the ques, parents were getting stressed and people were rude and aggressive understandably I think .It was the same whenever there was a character about que que que but the difference here was people just pushed passed and shoved your children out of the way ,shocking behaviour .I think it's a matter of time before a real tragedy happens here in regard to the sheer volume of people that they let in at one time ,I can just imagine that there would be a problem getting out all these people if there was an emergency which is very likely in this current climate .We did lunch with the princesses in the auberge de cendrillion ,It was expensive but it was the only way really that my daughters could get to see the princesses close up and have photos .Food was expensive in disney but people will pay it so they will charge what they like ,trick is to look for the meal deals that include a drink .Everything is closer than I thought so it was pretty easy to go from park to park and we found it best to do each section and rides one day at a time .The only thing that stopped me rating this place a one was the parades when you could see and the dream show which is a must ,it's late but so worth staying for its gorgeous. Disney really needs to sort out the crowd problem and either have more rides or let less people in unlikely I know as they are focused on    not customer experience which is a big letdown .","Neutral"
"Came here for 4 nights and we were really looking forward to it as we do love Disney and visited both the American parks and came here 12 years ago for my daughters first birthday so we were excited!! We landed and it was snowing so we thought it would add to the magic as the castle looked pretty but that   s it! Half the rides or more were shut either building work or snow, half term and it was like a building site yet we weren   t informed Phantom manor and other rides would be closed because I certainly wouldn   t have bothered going!Once I got over the fact it was like a builders yard in areas I had to contend with walking round an ice rink, poor attempts to remove snow and never seen anybody make an effort at all! Yes I know you can   t change the weather but you can deal with it! Shame on Disney as people pay a lot to come here for a few days and should see your staff grafting not just standing around.The security entering is a farce and you can queue up to 20 minutes before even getting near the entrance and then they   d just dumped cones and hazard tape everywhere making it more tacky that magical. On the third day we were there a snow plough appeared and the air was blue! It was at peak time for moving around between parks and the village and where had it blooming been for the other days!Also the greed of this place is unreal and they   d charge you for the loo if they could, food is overpriced junk so we went to the next town to get a break and decent fresh food. Take a travel kettle as you   re looking at around   4 for a brew we also got fruit and stuff from val d Europe which is a very good shopping mall, the supermarket is on the bottom floor and there   s also a designer outlet with the likes of Gucci, Marc Jacobs and Jimmy Choo it   s just one stop on the train or just head in to Paris.I   m going to make a formal complaint through the correct channels as we had a miserable time and feel let down and robbed","Neutral"
"This is one of the disney parks that I have been to the most but like the least some people say it is because I went so many times but I have a simple explanation this park lacks customer service and just quality over all it is a park but it is missing the magic touch of Disney.Overall the food is eatable in the park and the prices are decent if you are used to Disney Prices.","Neutral"
"HK Disney is very small and lines for the big attractions are long. We did enjoy our day and took in a few attractions and the Lion King Show. We really enjoyed the Philharmagic 3 D movie!","Neutral"
"We recently went to Disneyland Paris with our daughter she loved every minute of our visit. We were however a bit disappointed to find that several of the attractions were not open . We were not informed of this when we booked. That said what we did see was magical . I would recommend a visit here.","Positive"
"I've been 3 times to Disney, it's looking a little jaded now. I really wish they had a no smoking policy too, the place is littered with cigarette ends ... And not great to see the staff openly smoking!","Neutral"
"This is the ideal Disney for young children, (aged 2 8ish). Even our 2 year old could get on most rides and nothing had a queue so they could keep going round and round as many times as they liked. The park is small but pretty and with that Disney magic feel. The fireworks display was wonderful and a real highlight!","Positive"
"At nearly $100 per day for entrance, most attractions are included, however food is not and at $8  for a corn dog, that is not something to take lightly for a family! Plan on spending close to $100 per day additionally per person, just on food. Souvenirs are not cheap either. Plan on $26 for T shirts, $56 for jackets or sweaters, $20 $50 for Micky Ear hats, and $5  for little trinkets! Downtown Disney has great shopping, but prices are pretty similar. Free Disney apps help with things like dining, maps & wait times. Must try's are the Dole Whip at the Tiki Room, Bengal BBQ for a relatively inexpensive quick meal, Turkey Legs ($10) located throughout both parks now), the Monte Carlo at Blue Bayou and Goofy's Kitchen (worth the price, I promise!).","Neutral"
"We had the city pass that allowed us to visit the Disneyland theme parks for three days, we were able to hop to any park on these three days. We felt that two days were more than sufficient if used on a week day and planned well. The price of the city pass could be reduced and made more affordable so more people could visit. We found that the Disney World in Florida was a much better and well laid out park and offered better value for the money. Also food variety in Disneyland park was not very good and very expensive.The Disneyland down town was not what I expected and a total disappointment. On the plus side, I found that the customer service w excellent at the park and all employees were friendly and enthusiastic.","Neutral"
"I saw terrible review about queues but reality was much more better, we visited disneyland in weak season,There wasn't any queues at security check 's   only people with baggage went throuth scanner. There was same queues in park (peter pan, flying elephants, carousell) but we used extra magic hours to visit this attractions, and then we moved on to attractions where wasn;t queues event during the day (buzz light year , space mountain, small world, pirates of caribean ) . Regarding the food, best option for my children is Plaza garden(they have chips), it's nice pleace there you can spend same time while waiting to DisneyDreams. In off season you have to make reservation 1 day ahead , and in regular season is recomended reservation 5 days in advance. Another place i'd recomentd is Au chaulet de le Marionnette (chips   chicken) is another food which dont surprise you. ( you get real chicken ,  and not nugets made from bones and chicken skin )","Positive"
"Overpriced, considering that after entry you need to queue ages all the time to try anything you want. Eventually all the parents spend the day in the shop to make their kids happy. Or at the restaurants. No more.","Negative"
"If you can pull your kids out of a school to ditch for a few days, it's absolutely worth it to do it the week after spring break ends. There were practically no lines (we waited 40 minutes for the submarine ride and that was our longest line) and we were able to navigate the park without any crowds.","Positive"
"The weather was very hot so you don't see alot of characters walking around. Only chance is at the timeslots where they will appear. Service staff looks tired and lethargic as well. A lot of food stalls were closed as well, guess most people will wanna go into the air con restaurants to avoid the heat.Enjoyed the photo taking opportunities. The fireworks was good at 8pm. But the ground we sat on was hot from the Sun all day.","Neutral"

"We came as a family of 4, two adults and two kids aged 10 and 3. I have been wanting to go to Disneyland since I was 5 years old, I am 26 now. The shows fireworks were amazing and the d  cor very well done. Having come here for Halloween I expected a lot more Halloween decorations and not just in Frontierland.The queuing systems and wait times were absolutely shocking! How can anyone expect a child of 3 years old to wait in a que for over an hour for a ride? We were in both parks for a total of 23 hours and we got on 6 rides. Food in the parks is ok but not great and I met a lot of very rude French people who had terrible behaviour whilst here. People pushing into us in the toilets (toilets were black) We queued for an hour and 40 minutes to see the fireworks, people were pushing in front of us to see them even though my son was in a pushchair and the pushchair was getting pushed around with the ignorance of other people. You have to be ignorant to que for these shows, or you will just get eaten alive. Someone pushed in front of us at the 5.30pm parade, safe to say I took my space back, because like all the other French people I encountered I had to be ignorant to survive. If you are coming here for a day I suggest bringing snacks. The people put me off but the experience was still magical.Next time we will be avoiding the rides.","Positive"

"Disneyland's pretty okay, if you haven't been there before. This is the 2nd time I was there and it rained (again), but it was a good thing we still caught both the traditional and Halloween parades. First  ride  for us was a haunted house type of attraction where people jumped out of places and tried to scare the bejeezus out of you. That ROCKED! Space Mountain was still a thrill   with a bit of Halloween thrown into the ride's attractions. I just wish the cast members can speak better English, though, especially in the haunted house attraction.","Neutral"

"If you have a stop over and it is on a public holiday DO NOT waste your time and money going to Disneyland. The park overall is nice but the sheer amount of people is concerning to say the least! Getting in at the main gate will take you 1hour plus. If you are not used to the disregard chinese folks have for standing in a line, the experience will just get worse for you! Again avoid going to Disneyland on a public holiday. We were only able to ride 4 rides for a whole day because of the lines being extremely long! Tip when it comes to the jungle boat ride take the line that says english guide, you will not have to wait that long for a boat, chinese line will take you forever! Did like the parade!","Neutral"

"We booked a stay at DL 3 years ago and while it was a wonderful experience, the amount of e mail spam we receive is totally out of control. They take your email address and immediately spread it around to dozens of their businesses... vacations, movie clubs, merchandising, etc., and even if you unsubscribe from one it doesn't remove you from all the others. So you never know when a new Disney solicitation is going to invade your in box. It's terrible that after 3 years I have opted out of more than a dozen different Disney solicitations (itball began with one single vacation reservation) and yet this spam is still showing up. Today I got one from Disney Digital Books. I opted out of this one too, but who knows which new Disney business the next spam will come from. Really frustrating.","Negative"

Yes, 19 attractions closed!    Totally unacceptable. How come the cam charge full tickets from costumers. The park it self is a super mini poor version compared to the original Disney World and they open the doors during high season with 19 closed attractions on a Friday. What a hell is that?!It is a MUS NOT DO! Don   t waste your time and your money.Disney World management: just close this park or sell it to change the name. It is a huge downgrade for tour brand.","Negative"
"We expected queues....and to be honest, day 1 in the Disney park wasn't too bad ( a Monday), we got on most things ( with a 5 and 8 year old)... It's nice that the park really goes quiet after 8pm. Get your fast passes for thunder mountain as that is pretty much the only family roller coaster you can ride on ( space mountain has a strict 1.3m height). Be prepared to be ripped off for coffees, popcorn etc but go with the flow ( we sneaked sandwiches and crisps in). Day 2   universal studios....what a LET DOWN...hubby and I came here 10 years ago add it hasn't changed....massive queues for everything. You can only get fast passes for about 3 rides, and the kids rides in toy story land had HUGE queues. The toilets were smelly and wet floors after 2pm, avoid...and the food facilities were over crowded and some were shut...seriously Disney, this is not what we expect for a busy August visit, after spending 500 euros for a family of 4 for 2 days. The studio tour is absolutely rubbish ...not a patch on the Florida tour....the only decent part was the burning tanker....other than that, it's not worth the hour or so queue. My advice....run in early, grab a fast lass for tower of terror as that is the only amazing thing at universal, and spend the rest if the day in Disney. Don't get me wrong, we had run, but the studios is busy busy busy, and quite stressful.","Neutral"
"The Newport Bay accomodation was dated and in poor maintenance and unclean. The cleaners had a big task so its not their fault, whilst beds were made the furniture  door handles etc were dirty, and there was dust behind the furniture. The sink kept blocking up, the lights failed and the air con sounded like a broken down truck engine if on more than the lowest setting. This shows a complete lack of respect for guests by hotel management and displays only a commercial interest in making money.The French (culturally) was a barrier to the Disney experience. They weren't always the most helpful. I did sometimes have to remind myself that I was in a Disney Theme Park. I expected to see more characters, jesters etc walking around to help create a Disney atmosphere.Food was expensive and not nutritional unless you broke the bank to eat at the Disney hotel.Some good rides and shows but I am not sure all in all that it was worth the expense and time going. What a shame DisneyLand U.S.A has put its stamp to this substandard Disney experience in Europe.","Negative"
"I haved mixed feelings about this park. You wait, in the rain for up to 2 hours to get on a ride. People are happy but the staff are G R U M P Y, indeed they could save on costuming and just make everyone Grumpy. It could become the Snow White park; there's a cast of evil witches around too!The floats, decoration, parade, fireworks are BRILLIANT! All in all you have to visit.","Neutral"
"If you have been to America or Euro Disney you will find this one a disappointment. Great access but generally void of the big rides and shows,staff generally miserable and  not great English in general. On the whole not worth the money","Neutral"
"We went to Disneyland on 11 20 11 when we arrived it was great, then the heavens opened and it was rained out. We thought we would still make the best out of it BUT Most of the rides were closed due to the rain, how does that happen? The staff were incredibly rude, we tried to go through a bag check (which was open) to get back to our shuttle, and the rude security officer  snapped  at us and told us to go through the one further up which made us have to walk further with a five and six year old soaking wet, we turned around and saw that they were then letting people out that way. They dont seem to have a plan when it is raining and the staff turn into the wicked step mother in Cinderella when it rains, they are just mean. I personally will not be going back to Disneyland for a very long time. Happiest place on earth................NOT, Walt Disney would NOT be happy.","Negative"
"Nice place to visit with children but have to suffer with very long que or else you have to buy express card for additional cost.  Clean place , courteous staff variety of food available, but you cant compare this park to any USA disney park","Positive"
"Was awesome as always.  The last day was rainy and it kept crowd down.  I wish they would have one day a week dedicated to travelers and limit the annual pass holders.","Positive"
"I love visiting Disney parks, this was my first time visiting California so Disney was a must!My girlfriend and I drove to the park. I thought at the price of the tickets that car parking should've been free but then again Disney to a lot of people is a massive tourist trap.During bag search the security took my girlfriends selfie stick yet we did see people using them!If you only have 1 day to visit a park I would recommend the California Adventure park instead.Waited well over an hour for Hyperspace mountain as it had broken down. Pirates of the Caribbean was really disappointing compared to the Orlando ride. It broke down whilst we were on it.Quite a small park. We arrived around 3pm and stayed until after the fireworks but you could easily arrive first thing in the morning and go home around 1   2 pm and do something else.","Positive"
"Disney have taken their eye off the ball, this place isn't a patch on Disney parks in Florida.Our visit to Disneyland Paris was so disappointing, I don't even know where to beginThe staff are rude, unhelpful, arrogant and have completely forgotten that they work in a Disney park, they are uninterested in their customers.The rides, most of the major rides were 'having technical problems', and as a result the rides that were working had excessive queues.There was blatant Queue jumping at every ride, the staff we completely uninterested and did nothing about it.Characters, where were the characters? We saw a total of 3 characters all day. When we went to Disney world in Florida   there was a genuine magical feeling   unfortunatelyDisneyland Paris has nothing magical about it and feels like any other theme park. The prices, how can a small bottle of water cost in excess of    3, total ripe off, my advice would be to avoid Disneyland Paris,","Negative"
"Disneyland Park (Paris) is really worth the visit. Everything is setup in a good way, and the overall service provided is good. However, there's a big huge BUT. The very, very log queues for the attractions. We were here during the first weekend of june, and the average waiting time for most of the attractions is 40 minutes. The main attractions (space mountain, etc) is 60 minutes (and more). Even the restaurants have huge queues   a really usefull tip for restaurants: reserve on time, and I mean a couple of days in advance, not just one day in advance.Because we were staying in a Disney hotel, we also had access to the park between 08:00 and 10:00 in the morning. Unfortunately, only some of the atrractions are open during these two extra hours (most of them are only open starting from 10), so the added value is almost zero.","Neutral"
"This was my Son's first visit to Disneyland. We went with my best friend that lives in San Diego who has a child who has autism. I myself am a disabled veteran and cannot stand for long periods of time. When we arrived they had ran out of the motor carts and I could ask her to push me in a wheel chair so we went to the customer service center and explained the problem and I was told that the rules had changed and that the only thing they could don for me is let me use the kid's stroller as a wheel chair so i could hold myself up while waiting in the lines. I tried not to let that ruin my son's first visit but either optin not to get on the rides or having to endure the weight by sitting on the floor or edges along the sides when available. When we would finally get pasta certain point and they would see me with the stroller they would send me through another area so i could reach the ride but imagine my surprise when we had waited almost an hour and thirty minutes for a ride and as soon as we are getting to the from I am told to go the the disabled area and the line is longer that the one i was just on! I was angry and very frustrated seeing as how people who had been behind me were getting on the ride and we had to wait longer because I am disabled. This was suppose to be a magical place and greatest visit especially for the extremely high price of admission and to be treated poorly and practically punished for having a physical disability is a horrible experience. I saw how some other people were angry as well and a lady actually demanded to have her family seated immediately because like me was appalled of having to wait another 30 or so minutes to get on the ride just because we were disabled and have to watch people that were behind us get on. What happened to catering to the disabled? I have never had this type of problem before in any other park. Definitley not happy with the way we were treated and so not worth the amount of money I spent.","Neutral"
"the lines were long and the rides kept breaking and they closed rides without posting any information elsewhere in the park.    Loved Sea World the next day!","Negative"
"The park cost an arm and a leg, and another arm. Worst day was last Saturday. The lines for rides were blocking the means of walking around the park. The Fire Department would shut them down if they saw the ciaos. Employees are all about the rules. Ask for a request and most will not treat you very nice. They might meet your needs, but very abruptly.  Rules are Rules    you should have seen the signs in the parking garages and buses  Well, not if you took UBER to the park! Ok experience, but it is getting worse and worse and less enjoyable. I need to go back during the Super Bowl when no one else is there. California Resident passes should be more money. Why should it be cheaper for them to crowd the park than anyone else? Not a fun time! Still, got to take the grandkids when the grandkids want to go!","Neutral"
"You can't put a price on it... But you will definitely pay a great deal for it here. Everything is extremely over priced. I'm not totally tripping out over it... But it's kind of ridiculous ... We travelled from SC for vacation and came to Disney so my daughter could meet Minnie. Okay so no kidding... We got to the park at 1Pm visited both Parks and left by 6:30pm and the total cost with tickets for 4, meals, souvenirs etc.... We spent $1200. Kind of crazy. But we do EVERYTHING for our kids. Don't we? But this is too much. Clean the bathrooms more. Also, West Coast needs to pick up the Disney Go system that Disney World has. Much better system. Thanks for the memories. But we won't be returning.","Neutral"
"Rides broken frequently or closed... monorail, train, treehouse, pirates, matterhorn, splash mountain, indiana jones. Calif disney under major construction so it is a loooong walk everywhere and crowded. World of Color at disney is fantastic. crowds were rude and beligerant. frandkids were stunned. visitors from asia were particularly obnoxious followed by large families who send three to get in line and then follow up with bringing in 10 15 more family members. phony wheelchair 'patients  with groups of 5   12. Not pleasant for grandkids and damaging to their view that people are good. Can't imagine how hard it is to be a cast member at disney, but a large number of them were indifferent and rude as well. definately not the disneyland from 40 years ago.","Neutral"
"We had been planning to take our son to Disneyland Paris for some months but were so disappointed when we arrived. It is about 45min away from Paris so requires some travel. Really expensive to get in & then eat (which we had expected though). We could barely move it was so busy so I would hate to see what it is like in high season. Lines to get on even basic rides like the 'Merry Go Round' were 40mins which is ridiculous with a 1 year old. And worst of all, after searching high and low, we couldn't find Mickey Mouse anywhere to have a photo with him. Or really any character for that matter. Really disppointing!","Negative"
"It's called the happiest place on earth for a reason. If you aren't happy here, you aren't likely to be happy most anywhere. I started going back to Disneyland annually a few years ago after not going for years. At first I thought the ticket price was outrageous ($65 at the time), but once I went I could understand why. The bathrooms are always in good shape, the staff is amazing you won't find bad customer service in the entire park! You can eat on a budget if you choose to do so, but there are also some fantastic restaurants to enjoy! The rides never look run down, and just about every time I visit, all the rides are operational. Maybe this park isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy being a kid again for a day, you can't go wrong here. The addition of California Adventure makes the experience even better and now comparable to Orlando! Cars Land is so much fn to walk through and the Bugs Life section is awesome! There are more adult beverage selections in this park than Disneyland (if that's a perk). We are headed back in July this year and I have no doubts I will have another amazing experience!","Positive"
"Disneyland boasts the reputation for being the happiest place on Earth. We agree, it is hard not to get caught up in all the excitement. There is plenty to do all day, with rides, street parades by Disney characters, night shows, and fireworks. Do some research on the net before you go to learn how best to use the Fast Passes, it WILL save you lots of time in queues and help you get the most out of your day. Early in the day upon entry we found Disney Characters posing for photos with short queues. So go early and spend the day. Anaheim is also a beautiful place with plenty reasonable accommodation within easy walking distance to Disneyland.","Positive"
"Wewere in this magical place for the first time for both my husband and I and our two boys, ages 10 and 12. We stayed at the Park Place Inn and Suites. Very nice rooms, very clean and quiet. Nice large rooms too. We were just outside the pool so the boys could swim while we relaxed!! Loved downtown Disney and very, very impressed with how clean everything was. All the workers were extremely helpful. We used our fast passes for a few rides but the rides were not busy at all until the Friday. We were there Dec 6,7,9. Fantasmic was well worth the 2 hour wait to hold out spot to watch it. Pirates of the Caribbean was our favorite ride next to Splash Mountain. I would go again but next time leave more time for shopping. The fireworks were like nothing we have ever seen. None of the rides made any of us nautious. Just completely mezmerized by the whole place. Yes, food is expensive   you have to eat at the Rainforest Cafe, very unique setting. Boys enjoyed playing games in ESPN Zone. Very professional music played in Downtown Disney each night, very relaxing and enjoyable to listen too. Our hotel had 2 very nice gift shops with items much cheaper than in the parks. Would highly recommend this hotel. Stayed at the ocean park inn in San Diego. Had ocean front view, very nice. Extremely enjoyed our 2 week holiday, very sad to have to come back home.","Positive"
"I would recommend people to use the FastPass option for the popular rides! We used them a lot during our trip and got through the line ups faster!","Positive"
"It is over rated. There are limited rides and very few restaurants with wholesome meals. Prices at souvenir stores are expensive. Be careful of having your pictures taken for it will cost you from HK$100 HK$150 per photo. Better bring your own camera for your souvenir pictures. On the good side, the amusement park is safe and clean even at night time. They have friendly staff and the fireworks are spectacular.","Negative"
"I visited Disney Paris in 2001, 2005 and last month. Nothing new since my last visit. Same old technology, same attractions. Even the 3D movie (star wars) is still the same. That was somthing interesting 10 years ago but you can find the same now at you local village shopping mall. The queues are still long enough to kill the day. But you end up with an old fashioned attraction. They made no investment since my last visit 12 years ago. But they added a lot of new shops selling chineese Disney stuff for a fortune. On the day of our visit there was rain and they cancelled the shows at the last minutes without acknowledging visitors waiting for hours under the rain. Meanwhile they sold thousands of raincoats (for 10 EURs which you may find for 3 4 Euros at the city)....It was a promise that I gave to my doughter to visit Disneyland but was really not the place I visited 12 years ago (or it was exactly the same old place but shoudn't be)...I believe that there are much more interesting amusement parks in Europe and this place is just targeting to get as much money as they can from you...","Negative"
"We have just returned from a weekend break with our 3 children aged 4,11,14 and to say we were disappointed is an understatement . We found the park dirty and it's in need of a magic wand to make things look better. The castle was covered with scaffolding so the bottom half was in all of our photos , toilets are terrible with tissue and water everywhere . We actually had a competition amongst ourselves to find a Disney member of staff with a smile on their face .. We are yet to find one! . We have been to Florida Disney world and staff will come over and have a conversation and ask how you are enjoying your stay, even the retail staff seem to be in character they are always happy and polite . My advice to families would be to save your money and go to Alton towers instead, it's closer to home and a lot cheaper.","Negative"
"Loved the Disney park , lots to do and see. The only thing I would say is to improve your time management and queues. Customers don't want to wait an hour for 1 minute photo with the Disney characters. It's not fair as there are people with special needs who cannot wait in the line for that long.Also you should bring the character back at the Disney hotels. I was really disappointed this time. It would've made our stay even better if we got the chance to meet them in the hotel.Another point is to make the Disney parade a little longer . We had to wait 2 hours for a 11 minute parade which isn't good as we wanted to front row seats. There were a few people that blocked our view 'since they paid extra' and to my knowledge everyone pays the same price so why the differentiation? It should be fair and everyone should get the see the parade without anyone standing in their way as we were obstructed by staff members family and friends' It's unacceptable. I don't care who they are, everyone should be treated fairly!","Neutral"
"I came with very little idea of what to expect, but definitely skeptical. We have a 4 year old and a 2 year old, so this was for them. To be fair, the weather was pretty unpleasant....bitingly cold and at times drizzly. The temperature hovered around 1 or 2 degrees all day and a lot of rides were closed due to ice and snow. The upside of this was that queues were short or nonexistent. The longest we waited was in the Princess Pavilion (20 mins) ....not even knowing that we were queueing for the kids to be photographed with a princess.....and then ushered out the back door! What a monumental disappointment and waste of time that was. Fortunately it gave us a chance to defrost (toes had become numb waiting for Dumbo) and for the kids to share a sandwich for lunch.Captain EO deserves a mention as the most ridiculously absurd time waster of the lot. Don't go there. It's a Small World was a favourite with the kids..and even I found it mildly entertaining..and as there was no queue we did it twice. Phantom Manor and Peter Pan were hmmmm....OK, pas plus. Space Mountain was not my cup of tea, but my husband loved it....fast and furious!The 5pm parade was nice for our 4 year old....2 year old was fast asleep by that time...but not exactly outstanding. What I found most intriguing was how the dancers and characters managed to look so genuinely enthusiastic and cheerful despite having to leap about in the freezing cold singing something about 20 years of Disney magic, knowing they have to do it day in, day out......and are more than likely paid a pittance for it.On the up side, the park was clean and I found the staff we dealt with to be pleasant enough. I certainly wouldn't ever return....unless my children begged and pleaded with me to...when they're quite a bit older.We paid 70    for the 4 of us on a weekday...the 2 year old of course being free...& the 4 year old having free admission as part of the 'buy one adult get one child free' deal. So essentially my husband & I paid 35    each for the day in Disney Village. I believe the usual price for a non dated ticket is 60 or 70    per adult. I just can't believe people actually pay that much money to visit this place! It's mind blowing.","Negative"
"Be prepared to wait up to 60 120 min for a ride, that lasts only 60seconds. your feet will ache and your children will drive you crazy when your in the queue. I thought I was the only parent trying to keep a straight face for the kids, but when I looked at the others all of them were biting their lips or holding their heads in their hands! My children started to get sore noses and throats at the amount of smokers around them. There was a place in Disneyland where someone was puffing their toxic fumes at children. Think twice before you go, I wish I did.","Negative"
"There are too many night things going on ,so that it's hard to get around because large crowds are sitting around for hours waiting for the 5 nightly events that happen in the space of 2.5 hoursBut people are lined up for 3 hours before thatGetting around is very inconvenient for those that don't want to see a parade etc Disney staff use to be good with crowds but not anymore","Negative"
"We booked to stay at Disneyland Paris for 4 nights and visited the park everyday we were there. All of the staff we spoke to very friendly and helpful. the queue times for the rides with reasonable (The longest we waited for any ride was 40 minutes, download the app it tells you the queue times and helps you plan your day) The food was a bit pricey but then I'm used to that in the UK and a few of the rides were closed for maintenance but other than that we had no problems When you get there I would recommend you do the Steam Train that leaves above Main to see the whole park and get a feel for the park. It helped us alot. We will be back for sure (our group was 11 adults and all chad a great time)","Positive"
"Went there with family for one day, few attractions was closed for renovations and some closed because technical issues such as Submarine Nemo ( electrical problem) and also Winnie the Poo during queuing we has been announced delay because technical problem...again! I found this Disney park poorly maintain compared to the one in Hong Kong or Paris. We paid more than 500$ for a family of 5 and seriously it's not worth it at all!!Staff service is average, most of food proposed is over priced and poor quality.Well for me I will say Disney is not made to have happy family but to robe family!Honestly spend your money traveling with your kids on the beach or visit natural parks, this is cheaper and more fun!!One positive, carpark over there is good...but cost you 18$!","Negative"
"I have to admit that Disney Hong Kong is not the biggest parc we visited but certainly the nicest and most charming one with a variation on events ansdshows troughout the whole day. specialized in smaller kids which was proven by many fotosessions with all the known Disney characters. also a big variety in food is available. In the afternoon we attented the parade and in the evening there was a magnificent lightparade followed by the endshow and ofcourse a big Chinese firework. Transport is efficient and well organised with a own MTR line to the parc. A very nice day to spend even without kids and feel for this day as a child again","Positive"
"We had a nice day at Disneyland but it really is geared toward young children.  With the rides we had to queue for long times to be disappointing by most of them. The highlight was the Lion Kong Show which was very entertaining.","Neutral"
"Date of Visit: 25th October 2012Group: 3After reading a ton of reviews on Disney HK, I decided to reach at 9:00 AM sharp (considering that the park opening time is 9:30 AM)We did that...and alas ..on friday the gates open at 10:30 AMWe bid our time and did some shopping!. (Its pricey)Space mountain was so so, however the mine coaster was good.We didn't have to wait for more than 20 minutes for any ride.There were sudden heavy showers in between and the afternoon parade was cancelled.Come evening...and the entire halloween spirit came in full force. It was fun!The halloween specials were all in Cantonese though..which sucked! (the rides were good mind you)Overall an average experience","Neutral"
"Hong Kong Disneyland is the smallest disneyland I've ever been. Unlike the Disneyland in Florida, Disneyland in Hongkong didn't have much ride for adults or a ride that quite thrilling. But it's still Disneyland after all, so I'm still happy with it. The journey to Disneyland is interesting, since the have a special custom MTR, with mickey's head as the window. So you'll never ride a wrong MTR to go to Hongkong Disneyland.","Neutral"
"Although the park gets very crowded around this time of year, it is something you learn to get past  you're in the happiest place on earth! The long lines are great quality time for family and friends. The park is always clean, from the sidewalks to the bathrooms. The food options are great! Disneyland is a true American icon. If you have never been before  learn how fastpass works. It will make your day much easier, and help with long waits. Space mountain is a very fun ride. We also love Splash Mountain for cooling off! Pirates of the Carribean is so fun and typically not a long wait! We also really like Indiana Jones The Ride! The park is great for people of all ages  they do a good job of providing and catering to every age group. There are many great rides for younger kids and the park is very stroller friendly!","Positive"
"Stayed at Disney for 4 days, and had a mixed experience. A number of the rides were out of action for repairs   which is fine, we knew about this before booking. However, whilst we were there, 3 of the other rides also broke down, 2 of which after we'd been queing for some time. At one point, there wasn't a single working ride in one of the areas of the Park. One ride we saved our hotel fast pass for on our last night, at the end of our stay. It broke down just as we arrived, meaning we wasted our pass, and missed out on the ride entirely.I understand these things happen, but given the money we paid for a family of 5 to get into the Park, it leaves a bitter taste.To end on a happier note, however, the rides the children did go on they loved, and they came away happy   even if we as parents weren't!Ratatouille in particular was a surprise. A fantastic example of blending 3d cinema with ride technology. Easily the most fun we've ever had on a ride...","Neutral"
"In terms of fun factor, Singapore's Universal Studios was way better.The Disney Princesses seemed unhappy while touring the grounds and being ogled by children and people.The Night Parade was a let down. At the end of it we were asking if that was it. After lining up and being jostled around by the crowd we felt shortchanged.Staff at the souvenir shops were snooty   so why would people be happy in buying way overpriced Disney stuff we could get at lower prices elsewhere?There was no ride that I could say was super fun. And I was so looking forward to the Star Wars ride which was not fun at all   is that all they could think of?Maybe we'll have a better experience in Osaka with the Harry Potter theme park...","Neutral"
"Really disappointed with our 5 day trip to Disney Paris.  Hotel Santa fe really poor. Staff not motivated and certainly no Disney magic.  Having been several times to Florida and LA parks this was a real disappointment.  Fell sorry for the grandchildren.","Negative"
"I'm sorry I have to rate a visit to a Disney property as only average, but do to the exstensive renovations and limited ride avalibility, I have no choice. On the upside it looks like future visitors will have an opportunity at an expanded park with more attractions. 2016 and beyond should be great!","Neutral"
"This place truly is the best Disney park in the World!!!!!!One thing I would say is when we visited we had to report one of the workers because he shoved my dad out of the way and a little girl because we were all stood in the wrong place trying to watch the fireworks. The way they ferry people through is absolutely diabolical!!! I know people have to stand behind the ropes because of health and safety but there isn't enough room for everyone and when you are told, no sorry this is just for people who have paid extra to stand here, I think to myself what has happened to Disneyland, using the class system to allow people to watch the fireworks, who have spent a lot of money to visit. I am sad because what must Walt Disney think if he could see it now?! Really people? Its a shame because the theming of everything and the food in the restaurants was the best out of both Disney World and Disneyland Paris, so something needs to be done about the rope operation and firework parade operations in both Anaheim parks!!! I say they should limit the number of tickets each day so it doesn't pose a problem! Other than that it is the best Disney park!!!","Positive"
"I felt such a sence of peace being there as if I was still a young child. We spent new years eve in the park staying until it closed in the early hours of the next day. Then we walked back happily to our hotel drinking chocolate milk and sucking on lollipops. ","Positive"
"So much to do for all ages. We loved the Peter Pan ride, It's a small world, Buzz Lightyear and the absolute highlight was Star Tours.We did not like the length of queues (what's new?) and the amount of time it took to get served at eating outlets, especially the really slow ice cream vendors.","Positive"
"Loath the experience there due to its small size the rude mainland chinese who cut queues by sending a rep to every queue and an entire group cuts in to joins the single representative. Real ugly.","Negative"
"I used to love Disneyland however this place has gone downhill. I must know because we go here every year for the past 5 years and this was the worse of them all. Garbage not picked up which is so not like Disneyland. The food and service at their vendors have all gone downhill. Even the people frequenting this place are questionable. Not worth the time, money and agravation. Manh rides are always closed for mmaintenance so you do not get your money's worth.No more Disneyland for us!!!","Negative"
"Just spent 4 days here. basically you are spending thousands of dollars to wait in a line to park to wait in another line to get on a tram to wait in a line to get in the park to wait in line all day for anything. all this fun is split up with lots of very overpriced merchandise and mediocre food. There are a few good things, like watching your kids faces when they get to meet a favorite character or when you actually make it on a ride. then when its all done you get to wait in all those same lines again to leave. and dont forget there will be 100 thousand people pushing and shoving the whole time. Do it once if your not a local. way better ways to spend a couple grand in my opinion","Negative"
"Of course there is another surprise. Eat half the breakfast may be a  good friend  to say hello to you. Super invincible can not resist their lovely appearance  incidentally, we return to Taiwan that day, breakfast is in our live Disney Hollywood hotel downstairs,  Mickey chef restaurant  dining. Their breakfast buffet is also very good drops! After eating, into the Disneyland Hello. Because the weather is not very good, so today 's tourists did not yesterday. Lucky should be the first stop is here, is located in the fantasy world of  Mitch Fantasia.  It is a 3D small theater. Not only the screen is realistic 3D, you can smell the aroma of cake and champagne, even my sense of smell are ultra slow to have smelled ah (moved). I suggest you do not sit too in front, in addition to halo will go outside to know my pains!Although the film is not long, but I personally feel very worth a look! Originally thought that the protagonist will be Mickey, did not think turned out to be Donald Duck !! This makes me break glasses ah!","Neutral"
"as someone who's been to california disneyland and disneyworld in florida, I must say this disneyland is very small and lacking scarier rides. it had  it's a small world  and the princess castle much like other disneylands   however the other rides specific to this disneyland is for the much younger crowd. I did love shopping there  but it's similar to california's disney","Neutral"
"It is, literally, painful for me to write this review, and only give Disneyland an average rating. I grew up going to Disneyland, my husband and I are HUGE Disney nerds! We visit Disneyland and Disney World once a year!We planned our annual Disneyland California Adventure trip for the Monday and Tuesday following Thanksgiving. We don't have kids, and we both have jobs that are generous with vacation time, so we're able to carefully plan our trips to Disney around times when there are low crowds. My husband has an app with a crowd predictor for ALL of the Disney parks, it's usually pretty right now. It was this time around as well, at least in the morning. In the afternoon, all of the annual passholders begin to arrive for the evening activities. At this point, the parks become so crowded, it's downright annoying. Working my way through the crowds made me feel like a fish swimming upstream. We are true fans, we take the time to do all the special tours. This time around we did the Walk In Walt's Footsteps Tour, guided by Summer Rose (who was amazing!). This tour was really worth the time and money, I would recommend it to anyone who loves the man behind the mouse. We still had a great trip, I was just so frustrated by the crowds. Not to mention how rude people become when they're all crammed into small spaces!So, I would recommend a visit to Disneyland... without kids... and make sure to bring your patience... and a major credit card.","Neutral"
"I am currently trying to find the best place to formally complain about my recent break to Disney land Paris.I honestly don't know where to begin with the list of complaints..........The security on entering the park is fairly non existent. There were 4 adults and 4 children in our group and most days they ushered us through with out any checks at all. Given recent circumstance this left us slightly nervous. The park looks almost shut with boarding up EVERYWHERE saying under renovation for your future enjoyment. The majority of the large rides were shut, restaurants all around closed up, and some of the big shows again closed!This caused the queues at the remaining rides and shows to be insane. A serious lack of staff throughout the park leading to smoking everywhere even though it states it is non smoking. We stayed 5 days and due to the closures and queues we were only able to appreciate around 50% of the parks.Horrendous and costly experience.My advise is don't go.","Negative"
"It was a bit disappointing as the Cinderella castle was under renovation and we didnt get to see the fireworks. The park was smaller than we had imagine it to be. Rides weren't that many either. Good thing was that we went there during the non peak season so we do not really need to queue long for most of the rides. ","Neutral"
"Very Different to the N American Disney Parks. Not in a good way. The staff are not as friendly and the park is much smaller and the european attitude and Disney attitude do not mix very well. I was really disappointed with this park as I have been to the US ones and Japan so was expecting more.","Negative"
"Disney have done a great job getting everything in such a small area. Everthing in tip top condition keep up the good work every member of staff needs a big pat on the back.","Positive"
"Our 3rd family visit over a four day period and it was markedly busier than the same time in previous years. Although I expect queues on two if the four days the park seemed at bursting point and I wondered if the 20th anniversary offers had been too successful. The fast pass got us on one ride per day only, the remainder had over one hour queues so averaged around four a day of any note so this made poor value. There were less characters accessible to the children and fewer small accessible shows. Smoking by adults around children was common place and toilet waiting time for the girls was up to 30 minutes and long waits for drinks. I have had good times at Disney and the girls still speak favourably although even they reached the point of asking to go home. I do think Disney need to look at the place through the eyes of families and aim to improve. It will be a long time before I go near a Disney again.","Neutral"
"Disney is amazing but honestly we were there for 11 hours and went on 3 rides lol. It was so busy! Which we expected!!! We will go in more prepared tomorrow","Neutral"
"Go to florida! The park has a serious wasp issue, the ques were ridiculously long, one afternoon we managed (With fastpass) 3 ques and 2 rides, we had to leave to meet a booked dinner slot. So 4 hours of my life wasted. The placed needed a lick of paint. Want to meet the characters? Forget it, quing for hours to have a photo with a guy dressed in a suit is not worth it. Biggest waste of my money and time. Did I mention the wasps, makes quing interesting. Smokers should be banned from the place, you cannot get away from tobacco smoke, my poor kids are now on 40 a day. Please avoid at all costs and go to florida, or blackpool where this siht is expected!","Negative"
"Yikes, the worst thing about HK Disneyland is the never ending same same music, over and over again, the same tunes. Omg I could pull my hair out, I would seriously go bonkers if I had to work there. When my kids were small, we went many times and I have to say, they absolutely loved it every time. We even discovered that the best time to go is in the pouring rain as no one else is there and there are no queues! If it suddenly brightens up it will be about 2 hours before the crowds return, that, my friends, is a very good tip. Nowadays we never go and stuff like that I avoid like the plague but if you've got young kids then you just have to take them, they will love it. Remember tho, it's crowded as all hell, expensive, you can't take your own food so you are forced to eat at the restaurants and even buy water and the queues are long. I used to smuggle in sandwiches under a dark piece of cloth at the bottom of my bag, you can get stuff in if you hide it well. Enjoy x","Negative"
"Went July 2013. Worth buying the ticket for the two parks, especially if you like rides. Had a great time and one of the best things about Paris. Getting the train ticket was a horrible experience however. The ticket booths aren't in english and after politely asking an attendant in French how to work it i was promptly abused. Not very nice! Overall a great day, but not one of the best Disneylands as far as they go.","Positive"
"At night, Disneyland and California park look absolutely beautiful all decorated up with Christmas lights.  A must see!","Positive"
"No queue at all during October. It was hot because of storm few days before. A lot lovely memory from Disneyland. If you want to take pic with Mickey better to queue earlier.The afternoon parade, it will start before the castle and go to the first gate Which has train on top and done. But for evening parade, it will be start from the other direction, from train to castle.Its exhausting day but really fun","Positive"
"i was there with my 13 & 7 year old on 23 12 2014the children loved it spent almost 12 hrs in the parkit is good to book tickets earlier & be there a few minutes before the park opensAvoid a public holiday if possible else waiting time for rides can be up to 60 minuteshowever the place is disciplined with the queues well organised.Do the rides earlier ( wait time increases as the day progresses) & the other shows in the latter part of the day.There is a restaurant in the park serving good Indian food.The Parade & the fire works are simply not to be missed !","Positive"
"Everyone said that the days after Christmas are the busiest of the year at Disneyland. Everyone was right.When we first walked into the park (after waiting in line for over an hour to purchase tickets) we were so overwhelmed. The crowds were insane, and cast members were starting to rope areas off for an upcoming parade. It felt like we were being herded like cattle, with no real choice of which direction to go.We managed to ride a few rides, before heading back to the hotel for a break. We came back to the park around 10 PM, and it was an entirely different experience. The crowd was considerably smaller, and the experience was much more enjoyable.I do feel like the park was not well lit up in the evening, though.The best way to enjoy the park during busy times is to go early in the morning, especially during Magic Hour if you have the option, leave for lunch and an afternoon nap, then come back in the evening once all the families with young kids have left for the day.Some of the lines were 2  hours and most fast passes were gone by 2 PM. Go in with a good attitude, expecting to wait, and you'll be fine. Take advantage of the times of the day with smaller crowds, and you may even enjoy it!I would love to go back during a less busy time.","Positive"
"it is a smaller scale of the Disneyland compared to Tokyo but a good way to start with if you are with young children. The park tickets are quite pricey.","Neutral"
"Before I arrived I was so exciting while looking at Disney website, I even regret why I didn't booked disney hotel. However when i arrived i was surprised that Disneyland Hong kong is actually not very big. I like the US Main street so much, it's very beautiful, especially the Disney stores, it's really 5 star. When i see the cute stuff i felt like buying the whole store. We had a good time in Disneyland however I am quite disappointed while queuing for taking pictures with Mickey & Minnie, the queue is extremely long (1hour) and the character even had break time for 3 times during my queue. I had no idea why. The weird thing is the guy inside said  pls wait for 30 min  while actually they break for 5 min. Then I heard him saying  this queue is 1.5 hours more  why actually is not. I think he must go and learn some more English so that people won't be shocked to hear about  time  after long queuing. I actually get used to Universal Studio where I can find many characters in 1 street but here I only saw Mickey & Minnie, Pluto, Duffy, Alice in the afternoon and in evening I only saw Mickey, Minnie, Winnie the Pooh, Pluto and Goofy in different hut. I actually expect to see more like Donald and Daisy, Princess. Then another thing is We cannot take a pic with Elsa & Anna because we do not have the ticket that they give away in the morning. I saw 1 children was crying when Elsa & Anna said goodbye. Another advise from me is please do your shopping before the Disney paint night parade because it will be super crowded. Overall I think the entry ticket should be cheaper as inside there is not much to see.","Neutral"
"We went yesterday and I was so surprised how long the queues were, some up to 110 minutes. Considering an 8 hour stay is long enough and with an hour out for lunch, one can visit about 6 7 rides at most if one pushes it. I was very disappointed to say the least.The rides were Ok, the crowds limited progress, but the overall feel was really pleasant. We ate in an 'all you can eat' Mediterranean restaurant (G) on the map and that was enjoyable, nice decor, pretty good spread considering and at 26 Euros including deserts (all unlimited) very good value compared to 3 euros for a bottle of water outside!!Obviousely it is August and there will be crowds, but I don't remember waiting more than about 35 mins or so at Orlando parks for the most popular rides. Shame really as we were buzzing about this visit.I won't go back to do he rest of the rides, will only take my daughter to America.","Neutral"
"Me, my Partner and another couple went to Disneyland Paris for New Years on a coach trip for the day. Myself and my friend have previously worked at Disney World in Orlando and as my Partner had a broken leg, we were confident she would be well looked after as that is the Disney way.After just over an hour in the park and with it still fairly quiet we went to the Hollywood Studios Wheel chair and stroller rental area to find they had run out of both! in Disneyland!? We went to the information desk and were treated disgustingly by the 'Manager' Oliver. They refused to take my number and ring me when a wheelcahir was available, ringing an external company was out of the question and to top it off we were suggested my 25 year old partner should pay for a stroller?! Oliver said 'if it is such a big deal why didn't you bring your own wheelchair?' that is not provided when you have a temporary brake and it is expected to provide wheelchairs where ever you go these days. Eventually we were offered an easy access pass for her and 1 guest that would mean our party splitting up. The most upsetting part was the staff watched us for an hour trying to get in touch with the hospital to try and get a fax or email confirmation of the injury and they knew we were only there for a day before issuing this pass. As ex cast members in America that would have been just out of the question at Disney. They strive to make create happiness and magic and we were nearly in tears after this situation. In the end we had to split up from our friends for every single ride and spend ages trying to meet up again, time it right and spend i don't know how much calling each other to meet up. The lack of wheel chairs and push chairs was evident throughout the park as it got later you could see parents straining to carry their tired children and saw grown adults being pushed around in push chairs. In general, the floor was cracked and dirty and the cast members were extremely disappointing. It was hard to find any staff when walking around, some didn't know where bathrooms were or when shows were on. I saw a cast member using their mobile, smoking and  in most cases more concern with talking to their colleagues than the guests. i understand their may be a language barrier for some but after spending 14 hours in the park overall i only had 1 cast member wish me a Happy New Year. For those who have visited or worked in the Disney Parks in America will know what i have described would be just unheard of. We would have been fired if we didn't act 'on show'. I would recommend sending some trainers from America over to Paris to show them how it's done.In conclusion, save yourself the disappointment and just save longer to go to Orlando, then you will see the true vision of what Walt Disney was trying to achieve.","Neutral"
"Disneyland has something to offer to everyone, whether your aged 1 to 100 there is something for you in the magic kingdom. I have been to Disneyland 7 times over the past 25 years and this place never ever fails to impress. From the cleanliness of the park, the friendly staff (cast members) and the quality and imagination that has gone into the rides and the shows, seriously no one does it better than Disney.","Positive"
"Hongkong disneyland was a fun trip. Its best to catch the several shows going on. Going on the safari was fun. The food available is nothing to write home about. The experience could be much better in pleasanter (non humid weather)","Neutral"
"We (2 adults 2 kids) went Fri Sun in August, stayed in the Newport Bay Hotel. Hotel was OK family room a bit cramped. Basicaly a large  box  hotel with a fancy facade. The Park itself, well disappointing. Up to an hour and a half wair for some rides, fortunately hotel guests get in 2 hours early otherwise we wouldn't have bothered with most of them. Everything is very expensive to the point of rip off. You can't bring food drink in so you have to buy theirs. Example lunch   4 sandwiches, 4 bottles water 40 Euro.Two days is enough, during the last day the kids just wanted to go back to the hotel, boorish rude people pushing their way around the place I'd had enough too.My kids have been to Parc Asterix twice and would love to go back   they don't want to go back to Disney and that sort of says it all.","Negative"
"I went there and forget to bring a dozen pieces of Steam bunI have to left it at luggage service it's cost 90 HKD. No coin locker. They charge 90 HKD with every size then it's not fair compare with other place that have a coin locker that you can pay by size and by time","Neutral"
"Not all cars on rides were running, so some lines.  But the Mickey's Halloween Party was amazing our two granddaughters got tones of candy and scares.","Positive"
"First trip for our family of four. Our two girls are 9 and 11. We had a great time. It was off season so lines and crowd not too bad. Many attractions closed and no fireworks though. Our kids were the right age to enjoy both the kid and adult rides. We did 2 day park hopper which was just right for us. We had already played tourist in San Diego for 5 days. Cast members all friendly, most even wished our youngest happy birthday. The disney app with max pass was easy to use and with it the only line we waited in was for Peter pan with no fast pass. Fantasmic was a treat but hard for the kids to see because of adults stepping in front of them. All and all a good trip. Not quite 5 stars because of the attractions closed for refurbishment and several rides closed while were waiting and even on them (stuck for 20 minutes in middle of Indiana jones)","Positive"
"The size is bigger than Asia's disneyland. Similar to USA in regards to rides and themes. Hotels nearby via free shuttle bus return trip to Disneyland. Best is to stay there for few days because its' far from Paris. Beware of taking trains there, many pickpockets! Pre book tickets online!","Positive"
"Four food tips1. Carnation Cafe for breakfast is a great option. The apple granola pancakes are a winner. The kid's multi grain waffle wasn't. The bacon and sausage are average. Just get the pancakes. 2. Matterhorn Macaroon at the Jolly Bakery is a unique option. We liked the cake better than the topping. 3. The Pineapple soft serve in Adventure land is the first I've experienced. It is great and a must. 4. The Plaza Inn for lunch or dinner is the best food in the park. The fried chicken dinner is a winner, and it comes with green beans, mashed potatoes, gravy, and a biscuit. Game, set, match!","Positive"
"If you love Disneyland? Skip Disneyland Paris, because you will be disappointed! First there are very few rides, half of the restaurants were closed, you have to wait in line to make a reservation to meet a princess, then come back and wait for your reservation! They let people smoke in the park, people cut in line and the people who work there don't care! The service sucks, the employees are rude, and act like they hate their jobs! The park is dirty, the restrooms are small, AND dirty, there are very few garbage cans, and no benches to sit on, rides were closed or broke down often, and you can't get any information from anyone, because they just don't care. It was the worst Disney experience I have ever had!","Negative"
"The park was beautiful and the employees were kind and extremely organized. However, the kids rides there are NOT for young kids. Extremely scary and I'm really shocked that they haven't gotten in trouble for allowing young children on rides that are seriously evil. Avoid all the rides that go inside the buildings. They are NOT suitable for young kids, or anyone for that matter.","Negative"
"There is so much I could say about the way the budget cuts and poor cast training is spoiling Walts little park but as a long time returning visitor I will simply address the cuts in cleaning and leave it at saying these cuts apply to the way the place is run as a whole . We first visited in 2004 and couldn't get over how amazingly well the place was kept , the legendary no litter everything spotless . Now it appears the rivers of America has plastic bottles and popcorn boxes floating around all over ,bins overflow and when folks empty drinks or snack bags they just drop them on the floor . Walt Disneys legendary Disneyland railway train pulls into the station full of litter both on the floor and on the seats . The restrooms that used to be the cleanest I had used now are dirtier than the ones at Heathrow airport (no Mr Iger that is not a compliment)","Negative"

"As group leader this was my second visit to Disneyland Paris in the last four months and my 10th visit overall. On this occasion our group comprised 21 children and 20 adults (parents and chaperones). For most it was their first visit and they all enjoyed it thoroughly.However, standards are slipping noticeably. Perhaps there are fewer staff at this time of year or due to the recession. That does not excuse the bad manners I experienced from Disney staff at the start of my visit.1. We mistakenly thought our tour organizer had left us short a ticket so I purchased an additional single ticket at the group desk in the coach park. On arriving at the entrance we discovered that our tour organizer had given sufficient tickets and we now had an extra one. The ticket office refused to refund the extra ticket just bought even though I still had ticket and receipt. The sales girl referred over her shoulder to her supervisor who dismissed her with a shrug saying we would need to return to the coach park desk to discuss any refund. Rather than allow Disney to gain, I passed the ticket free of charge to the next stranger waiting in the queue!!!2. Despite the fact that the park was not busy all the queues (including toilets) were excessively long with people pushing in and climbing over barriers. There appeared to be no Disney supervision. 3. The queues to obtain photographs after the bigger rides were almost as long as the queue to get on the ride in the first place.4. A number of the rides were not operating. 5. A number of our party were stuck on the Space Mountain ride and had to be evacuated when it broke down. (Makes one wonder if there are safety concerns here!)6. A number of the restaurants were closed.7. The service in the open restaurants was appallingly slow. The food was cold, poor quality (even for  fast food ), and very expensive. Eating areas were dirty with excessive delays in cleaning off tables.8. Souvenir shops were expensive, slow and crowded as expected.It is a shame to see standards slipping like this and I hope somebody in Disney Management will sit up and take notice!!!","Neutral"
"Its my first time here, but i'm not a big fans of disney so i just looking for the ride.. After walk around from one area to other area and take some photo with my tiny group. We started to try some ride that we...More","Neutral"
"FAST PASS! Use fast passes for everything   learn the strategy. We went peak month of July  park was packed. We, family of 4, rode everything we wanted in 2 days at both parks and never waited more than 20 minutes   thank you fast passes!","Positive"
"I have been to Disneyland twice in my life. Now that my little girl is 8 years old, I though now is the perfect time to take her. She will remember this trip. Yes the lines are very long to get on the rides and yes the food is very expensive. But its Disneyland and that is to be expected. We arrived at 8:30 am and didn't leave until after 10 pm. My legs were killing me but it was still a good time. The pirate ride closed down several times, then finally we were able to ride it. All the cast members we encountered were very friendly. My daughter and our whole family had a blast. The clam chowder breadbowls were out of this world. Crowd control would be nice, but we still had a great time. Can't wait to go back. Stay for Fantasmic, its worth it.","Positive"
"The parades were great, but the bathrooms were filthy.  Could it be that Disney is trying too hard to cut its costs, not staffing the park sufficiently?","Negative"
"Travelled with my husband and two boys (11 and 8) and while we can now tick it off the list of life experiences, we would never go back. Ok it was August so it was going to be busy, but it was way too over crowded. Even walking round was a nightmare   there were just too many people admitted! Queues were long and boring. No attempt to keep kids entertained   what about video screens in the queuing area showing Disney films? The number of parents I heard having to keep arguing bored kids apart while waiting for rides   it made me feel relieved it wasn't just mine! Yes, we did Fast Pass, but as you get a time slot a couple of hours in advance and can only hold one at a time, it doesn't really help. The rides are great. The night time firework display was impressive. However the only characters we saw in a full 13 hour visit were in the tea time parade   where are the roaming ones from the glossy tv ads? Apparently to meet them you need to queue in a two hour meet and greet venue. Food of course is hugely overpriced and of poor quality, but that was only to be expected from a captive audience.I'd say we enjoyed the Studios more and the motor stunt show was well worth seeing. It was an ok day but never to be repeated.","Negative"
"Very crowded and a bit expensive.  Go when it first opens and you still have space to move around. My kids enjoyed the rides and the characters are all over the park so its a good opportunity to take photos with them.","Neutral"
"I really wish Disneyland would cap their occupancy. We were there all day but it was so crowded, we barely had time to do a small part of our itinerary. The crowds were thick and maddening, especially with the millions of strollers scraping the back of our heals. Lines were unbearably long without fast passes, and only a handful of rides have that option. I love Disney but this last trip truly challenged that love.","Neutral"
"I took my 3 1 2 year old to Disneyland about a week before Christmas. This was the worse idea ever!!! It was soooo packed we could move dowm main street. We stayed for 4 day and 5 nights thinking that it would be long enough to see do everything...it wasn't. I knew that it was going to be busy, but never imagened that it could get that packed. They actually had to turn people away because they were at their limit at the park. Thankfully, we were already going to California Adventures that day. That being said, it was kinda cool seeing all of the Christmas decorations up. The best thing was that the Haunted Manson was changed to Nightmare Before Christmas. Overall, I think this time of the year would be bast for older children who can easily walk through a LARGE LARGE crowd.","Neutral"
"Love to visit the park but they need to improve their communication! Why have a live information app if you wait to turn kids away AT THE GATE?!Our situation was unusual but it was disappointing: it's not Disneyland's fault we visited during a rainy weekend. We waited until evening when the rain cleared away to head to the park only to be told at the gate it was closing early. I had been watching the app for any info but there'd been no warning. It hadn't occurred to me to check twitter because i assumed the Disneyland app would show an alert but no :( a ticket wasted and a hysterical child to take back to our hotel. So make sure you check ALL their sources of communication!","Negative"
"More than what you think. Its simply amazing. Adds up to all expected outing. Sure must go.  Visited in june, bit rain. Do outdoor activities first.","Positive"
"I knew this place wasn't going to be up to much as we've already done Florida.I was pleasantly surprised by the transport to the park, the train was fun.Main Street is lovely, sleeping beauty castle is small & underwhelming.Everything looks a little tired & run down but I've read it's on the verge of huge investment.The staff are not like Disney staff and really look like they'd rather be somewhere else.The parade was great and a lot less busy than Florida so you get to sit right on the pavement at Main Street.Merchandise much cheaper than America.Fireworks were not worth waiting for.I've done it once, I wouldn't go back.","Neutral"
"I went with my mum, sister, 6 year old daughter and 4 year old nephew. Altho the kids enjoyed themselves while in the park on the rides, even going in October it was still busy (some rides over an hour and a half wait)The euro is pretty much the same as the pound at the moment so everything to me was well overpriced. My daughter got the tangled dress from the disney store in the uk and it was   30, in paris it was   60. The food was proberly the worst thing for me and again overpriced. Most places to eat were like 'fast food' places and very expensive. We went to a buffet place one night and for 3 adults and 2 children (including 1 soft drink each) it came to just under   100. And lastly....the studio park closes at 6pm and the main park at 7pm after this there is nothing to do except eat and shop with the exception of the show or cinema.I wont be going back.....","Neutral"
"I traveled to the USA from New Zealand in November last year, myself and two children, 13yrs, 12yrs. We stayed at the Howard Johnson (See review) We arrived at Disneyland on November the 19th, a Wednesday. Firstly I must say ,we had what no one really has   NO CROWDS!!! And you know why? Because they were all waiting for the Christmas Displays to open on the Friday. We followed the plans in the Ultimate Guide to Disneyland book, they really do work. We were early and I had studied the maps. We could ride Space Mountain as many times as we liked, the most we waited on any ride was 10mins. We even said to each other, what was everyone talking about? Disneyland isn't that busy!! We used our park hopper ticket again on the Friday   we then knew what everyone was talking about!!But because we had been on everything twice!! we just picked the ones we wanted. Also, we split up for two hours and met back, the older kids didn't want to ride  It's a small world!  We also found using SINGLE RIDER passes to be fantastic too! Most of the time we used these even though we were together, 4 5 times we were on the same ride together anyway! Just not sitting next to each other. I would do this again if I'm so blessed to be back. I felt very safe and did not worry about the kids. Coming from new zealand, we found the food to be very resonable, Knotts Berry farm was a joke, $8 for a milkshake???!!! At Disney they have water fountains for you to use. I loved Disneyland.","Positive"
"The park is a much smaller version of the Disneyland of LA or Disneyworld of Florida. We enjoyed it but missed see the complete park that we had seen several time in California. The shows were wonderful and the staff was very good, helpful and always pleasant and caring to the kids that were so excited to see their favorite Disney Characters","Neutral"
"I moved to Florida 8 years ago and was visiting my home (California) over July 4th weekend with my family. It was the first time for my two year old nephew and I was a bit disappointed at the customer service overall. At the gate we were told my nephew could get a pin that said it was his first time at the park but they were out. They kind of shrugged and said we could go to City Hall to get a pin (which we were not going to do with two little ones). At the rides the customer service was not consistent....many of the employees looked like they did not want to be there and would chat amongst themselves. At Casey Jr's Circus Train my brother, nephew, and niece made it onto the ride and were saving a spot for us since my mom is elderly and we had to walk slowly....so her and I were waiting to board and my niece told the person working we were to get on with them and the worker ignored her and did not let us on. I do have to mention that at the Indiana Jones ride the customer service was spectacular and everyone looked and acted like they wanted to be there and wanted us to believe in the fantasy. at the Winnie the Pooh ride not so much. Anyway, of course I would go back but I wanted to mention that I noticed this change in service from years ago.","Neutral"
"My daughter wanted to visit this place after our last visit to Disneyland, USA was more than 10 years ago. As expected, it was much smaller in size with 3 main parks   Tomorrow Land, Adventure Land and Fantasy Land (not sure if Toy Story Land can be counted). Transportation to the park is relatively easy but can be a long journey if one does not stay in Lantau Island where the park is situated. As it was a Saturday, a large crowd was expected but however to our surprise the queues to the rides were not that long. Most of the crowd was found in Fantasy Land (for children). The attractions were pretty much the same as in the other Disneylands. We watched the fireworks before calling it a night.","Neutral"
"We went on a Saturday which is apparently one of the busiest days! Rides were good but some booked out. Definitely get the fast pass and use the App. Didn   t wait for the parade as it was so crowded. If going with younger kids I would go to this park early before it gets so crowded then to California park. ","Neutral"
"Disney park is just great for everyone, young and old, there is so much to see and do. Most rides were suitable for our 4 and 6 year old. Thunder mountain and Pirates of the Carribean were our favourites. Food and drink are very pricey in the park, bring your own.","Positive"
"I'm glad we went but also glad we didn't do the 3rd day! My children are 12, 10 and 8 years old. Perfect ages in my opinion. They all loved it and have fab memories. However, I don't think we'd go again. It's a once in a lifetime experience.Day 1 was spent in the theme park and day 2 was spent in the film studio park. Day 3 can be used for anything you missed the previous 2 days!?! You definitely need 2 days The stunt car show and Mickey Mouse stage show is a must see. Space mountain and the Hotel Lift ride were the most scariest! Sadly, lots of rides were out of order.Generally, it's expensive, most queue's are 30 60mins long (take a game device for the kids to play on in the queue to stop them moaning!) and it's exhausting mentally & physically. You need a small bank loan to afford the souvenirs and restaurant prices (assuming you've booked in advance). Hotdogs are 5 euro's!!! Take lots of healthy snacks, because you'll be gasping for fruit and vegetables by time you leave. It's all processed food and sugar induced. You can take a picnic, but this will be heavy to carry around all day.On a positive note the rides were great, it's very tidy and everything looks amazing. The security checks were good before you enter the park s. The toilet facilities were (hidden) everywhere but not very clean. They could do with free water fountains. It's easy to get lost in the park s. There are maps inside the entrance though. To make the most of your time, go online first and gather info and work out a logical route to rides that personally interest you. Most rides require the child to be above 120cm. The fast track pass machines were mainly out of order or only open for an hour   shame. I was expecting to see lots of dressed up characters wandering around for photo opportunities, but sadly there were only a few and you had to get in line for that too. We arrived at 10am and left after the 11pm 'firework' display. We still didn't manage to get around the park s because of queue times mainly. We had a 3 day pass, but decided it was just too much effort to do the last day and to be honest   we were sick of fast food and waiting walking around : ( The fireworks were worth waiting for. WOW amazing : ) The pyrotechnics and fountains to music was lovely. The best bit was the Disney film characters appearing on the fairytale castle in the smoke of the fireworks   very clever. The firework crowds were huge and little one's will find it hard to see unless they sit on your shoulders. Some people are so rude and just walk around you and stand in front of your child!!! It's a bit of a cattle herding crush when everyone leaves and children could easily get lost in the rush to get out the tiny exit area. Be careful.The car park system is great and works well, which is what you need for excited and or tired families. It's huge, so remember where you parked! In summary   we loved it and are fortunate to afford it, but won't return with older children.","Positive"
"I've been to the ones in Japan and Hong Kong. The castle in the California one is smaller in comparison but I think this was the first Disney park so it's not a deal breaker. Plenty of different rides for all ages. If you want to enjoy the two parks thoroughly, I think it's best to be here for two days; one for each park. We only went to the Disney park and not the California adventure as we didn't want a crazy day going back and forth with the park hopper. Another thing I was able to compare was the food theming seems a bit better at the other parks I had previously been to. Only saw a mickey pretzel. The merchandise was good. Queues weren't too bad and we managed to go on most of the rides. Only the Matterhorn ride was closed. We booked with Lux Bus America and they picked us up from our hotel. It was easy to arrange and they call you to confirm your booking the day prior to make sure you are still going. If you don't respond, I don't think they book your tickets to Disneyland so make sure you call them back if you miss the call.","Positive"
"Fantastic day bring money and plenty of it and also bring a plan! Bring in your own food and drink and plenty of it to cut down costs and give you lots of energy. You will not be disappointed especially with the fireworks","Positive"
"You had to park far from the park, take an escalator down, then take a tram quite a way to the actual park, long lines, then if someone had a special higher priced ticket they could go into a special line ahead of you...it was frustrating and I have decided never to go back...food booths are very expensive.","Negative"
"So many amazing things to do, rides for all ages.  We had 3 generations and there was something for everyone.  Characters were amazing.","Positive"
"We have just returned from 4 nights at Euro Disney, we took our children out of school hoping it would be quiet, be warned the Spanish school summer holidays started a week ago and it was absolutely packed to capacity, you could barely walk and the queues were ridiculously long, over an hour for most of the big rides. The fast pass was useless unless you managed to get one first thing in the morning, by lunch time the fast passes had either run out or the next available slot was after 6pm. When you have managed to get a fast pass you cannot get another one until you have used your first one so if your fast pass ticket is for later in the day you cannot get any others. At one point the queue to get a fast pass was over 20 minutes long!!Another disappointing thing was how miserable the staff are, this is Disneyland and they could barely break into a smile. So many rides  areas were closed, I have never seen to many green boarded up areas before.It's a small world ride was absolutely stinking dirty the floor under the water outside was green with fungus and during the ride we saw empty crisp packets and drink bottles floating around.Crowd wise I don't know how this park functions during it's peak times when it was at bursting point in June with just the Spanish school children on holiday. If you are yet to book I would highly recommend you check the European school holidays as it seems with even just the one country on holiday it makes a huge difference. On a positive note, the firework show in the night (11pm!) was fantastic, Crush's Coaster ride was fantastic but the waiting times were awful. Our two daughters loved it but unfortunately couldn't get on too many rides due to the queues. Buggy hire is 15 Euros a day, if you want to keep the buggy overnight you need to pay a refundable deposit of 70 Euros. Ice cream lollys were around 3.50 Euros.","Negative"
"Extremely overcrowded. The wait for most rides was between 90 to 120 minutes! Main Street was cordoned off for parades and other events, so everyone had to use the sidewalks only. It was shoulder to shoulder crowded and everyone was being directed on where to walk by the cast members, who were all wonderful under the circumstances. We were even directed to walk behind the Main Street buildings (this was a first for us). I paid for my Park Hopper tickets ($125 each) in advance online. It's very disappointing that management would allow so many people into the park, creating such overcrowding that my daughter and I had a terrible time. At 3:00 p.m., we got our first Fast Pass tickets, for Star Tours, which gave us a return time of 12:50 a.m.! We couldn't get Fast Pass tickets for another two hours! Even going through the Fast Pass line for the Haunted Mansion, we stood in line for 35 minutes. For the Star Tours Fast Pass, at 1:00 a.m., we stood in line outside in 45 degree weather, for 40 minutes. Patio heaters would have been helpful.The lines for food were very long. After purchasing our food, we could not find seating inside, so had to try to find a table outside. It was cold that day, so by the time a table was available, our hot food was now cold. And, of course, the food was expensive! No patio heaters outdoors, either.The lines were just as long at the California Adventures Park. We've been to Disneyland quite a few times before, but this was the worst time we ever had there. This was not a happy time and my daughter and I have no desire to return. I left with the feeling that Disney was only interested in money, not providing a fun and happy time.","Negative"
"After years of anticipation Disneyland failed to live up to the hype. The rides are dated and average compared to the likes of universal studios, ridiculous wait times, break downs, a stupid amount of visitors led to us leaving very disappointed and wishing we had spent our money elsewhere! Unfortunately the magic of Disneyland must only exist if you are 7 years and under. Personally I would not waste my time taking a young family here, not only is it expensive for entry, food is expensive, merchandise is expensive and wait times are ridiculous  especially for young children! Disneyland needs to take a leaf out of Universal Studios book... Covered areas for ride queues and front of the line passes might make it more enjoyable for people","Negative"
"We ate Mexican in California Adventure and breakfast and dinner at Disneyland.  Everything was delicious and very reasonable!!!","Positive"
"Its not the fault of Disney that such a bad typhoon storm hit and closed and disrupted operations. It is their fault and responsibility in how they handle the ensuing customer issues.When we explained to Mr.Dominic Chanat the Hong Kong Disneyland Reservation Center that we travelled far with our kids, paid for plane tickets, paid hotel, etc and bought silver passes to the park and had limited time he didnt seem to care. The park was closed during our stay for one day and many things in the park were not running or closed. All we asked was to be able to use our passes on Saturday to make up for the closed day and the other problems as we leave Sunday.He gave us the magical template answer with a NO, passes cant be used on Saturday with no consideration. Greed before customer concern is how they responded to the aftermath of the storm.The park is currently in disarray and best to avoid until they get the place fixed up and can ensure us that all the attractions have been inspected for safety due to storm damage that may compromise safety.","Negative"
"Being American and a former Disney employee I have had many Disney experiences. We enjoyed our time at Disneyland Paris and the kids had a good time so just a few comments.The fast pass is awesome   use it wisely and you won't wait in a line all day. Immediately go to the ride you want that has a fast pass, if no line or a short line, get the fast pass and then stand in the short line   that way you get to go twice. Get there early, right when the park opens and then go on the busiest rides first (Crush's Coaster, Rock and Roll Roller Coaster and Tower of Terror at the studios). This way you can get them out of the way and enjoy them without a long line. From experience, you can usually do 2 3 rides in the first hour with very little wait. Also, as soon as you can get another fast pass go get it. At the US parks there are very clearly designated smoking areas   perhaps they have them in Disneyland Paris but no one smokes there. It was overwhelming. People holding their babies smoking, smoking in the queues, restaurants, bathrooms, everywhere... the staff did not direct people elsewhere to smoke. This was disappointing. I am appreciative of differences when we travel but people blowing smoke in your children's faces is not cool.","Neutral"
"Star Tours is still fun (though I miss the original  Episode IV: A New Hope  and preferred it to the new theme), as is the Indiana Jones ride, and Pirates of the Caribbean remains a perennial favorite, aaarrr matey.But they TOTALLY RUINED the submarine ride!!! Replacing actual three dimensional semi realistic looking fake fish ad other aquatic creatures, and replacing them with cartoonish  Finding Nemo  CGI graphics?!?!?! Ugh!!! And getting rid of the super cool giant squid and sea monster that had always been my favorite parts of that exhibit?!?!? Double ugh! For that, Disney, for not leaving well enough alone, you suck!P.S. I actually last went in January 2014, but TripAdvisor doesn't give me an earlier option that June 2014 on its pulldown menu.","Neutral"

"My husband had a small soft bouncy ball my son had and was playing with prior to our departure from our resort before we boarded the shuttle to pass time. We took this into the park 3 times before the last time security took it out of my husbands backpack and said we had to    surrender it or take it to the car.    Because we took the shuttle, the car wasn   t an option. The security officer then went on to say that if we were caught in the park with a ball, we could be escorted out of the park. My son was so upset over this. He had just gotten that ball when we arrived in California. Keep in mind Disney sells balls very similar to the one my son brought in, it just didn   t have a mickey face on it. I was told that the reason they allow sales and possession of these same types of balls in the park was because    they   ve been checked over.    My son had not once taken that ball out of my husbands bag. He just had it to play with prior to us arriving to Disneyland. The chamber of commerce cast member did absolutely nothing with my complaint. The only person who truly cared was a cast member named Nina who was working in the guardians area on the night we were there. Thank god she was working, because she gave us a voucher for my son to use to replace the ball that was taken from him. She was kind and sweet and let me vent my frustrations about our experience with Disney. She was wonderful. She was the positive light in our day. When we were leaving the park we were told by the security officers that the    bin    (this is where they put all of the items they confiscate from their guests) is essentially off limits and will not be available for guests nor will they hold the item they take to be picked up at the end of the day. When I asked where they take all of the toys they take from these kids, I was told the trash compactor. Can you believe this??? A billion dollar company not even willing to donate the items they   ve wrongly taken. What is a small bouncy ball going to do Disney? I can see if it was out and being played with or causing disruption. But to take it because it   s considered sporting equipment (they have listed on their prohibited items online things like    helmets, baseball bats, hockey sticks) no where does it say bouncy balls. Come on Disney. Unbelievable. You won   t have to worry about escorting my family out of your park. We won   t be back. Also, half of their rides at California adventure park are being repaired or maintenanced so just be aware of that when you go as well. If a ride breaks down and guests had a fast pass to that ride, they   ll allow them to choose another ride (which is nice but not necessarily fair to the other guests who had a FASTPASS to the line with a ride working) so we waited 35 minutes to get on our fast pass ride. This situation went far beyond the $5 ball. We got my son another one. It   s the principle. We were treated as though we brought in a weapon.. and then told this    weapon    we brought was going in the    bin    and then to the trash with all of the other innocent not harmful items taken from kids. I appreciate security and what they do to keep everyone safe. I truly do. I respect their efforts, however, this was asinine and uncalled for. This was the item security found to be a threat and dangerous enough to get you escorted out of their park. Be on the lookout for these balls when you go and by all means DO NOT bring them to the park unless you want a heartbroken child and it put in the    bin   . They are hazardous and prohibited. Terrifying little thing isn   t it?","Negative"
"So me and my family were looking forward to our trip but what a disappointment. First of all, 15 euros to park your car. Then you are not allowed to bring your own food in, so we ate our sandwiches outside the venue. Thank goodness we did as the price for food and drink inside were so high.The younger kids waited 1.5 hours in the queue to get on their first ride which was the dumbo ride. I walked around with the older kids for over an hour before we could find a ride that we could get on, very frustrating. Queues were huge, average of 85 min wait I feel is unacceptable!! and at 3pm they closed down all the fast pass access for the day.The rides are quite short. You queue for ages and then you're on the ride for like 2 mins and then you're off.The parade was good although you did not see characters walking around much, only saw one princess. There was a 45 min wait to see mickey mouse, so we decided to come back later and then it closed.The gift shops are ridiculously expensive. All in all for the day the kids went on about 5 rides from 3pm to 10pm. Given that we paid   45 per person this is really poor.Very disappointing and will be saving up to go to the one in florida which I hear is much better.","Negative"
"Disneyland is a funfair where you should enjoy rides that have Disney themes and characters. However this is not what you get. The visit is very costly (about    130PP for a two day two parks), and your time is wasted queuing and waiting for things to happen which would only take seconds. My visit started 10:30am and ended at 6:30pm. During this whole 8hours we have only been to 2 rides!!!! How did this happen? Ok 40mins waiting to exchange the vouchers we got from online booking to actual tickets. 30mins waiting to pass through the gates. 45mins waiting for each of the two rides (which one was about 10mins long and the other 35seconds long). 40mins waiting to order and get lunch from one of the restaurants. 35mins waiting in mickeys house to take a pic with the character (done in about 20seconds). 50mins waiting time (standing) for the    famous    parade. Plus obviously the moving time between rides.In short this place is overpriced and overrated and should be avoided. Alternatively, if you have some money that you want to part with to get into a rich experience, you are better off going to a theatre, and you could actually go to the Disney   s Lion King play which is very nicely done and your kids could enjoy the experience without the hideous torture of waiting on your feet for long hours.","Negative"
"Was lovely seeing the princess castle. But not much has changed in 7 years. Specially the food over priced. Burgers fries and pizza no fruit or jackets or sandwiches. Is say take it all from home. The rides were all reduced in time from the last time we were here.No characters walking around at all. You can meet the princess 1 hour waiting Q. 4 d cinema is closed for summer, I  asked why and lady replied she didn't know it just is !!So their was no 'honey I shurnk the kids'. Q time was written 45 mins tat would mean over 1 hour. Fast pass u still have to Q at least 15 to 20 mins. Some times the fast pass was not available. Only one parade a day at 5.30, get their early because theirs no where to stand. Best place is on the balcony of the train ride at the entrance it finnishes their. Everything is over priced Micky mouse ears 18 euros, light ones 20 euros., not worth it. Dolls over priced and outfits. Elsa outfit 49.99 euros. Best to buy outfits from home. I brought a doll from here and gave it to my daughter their which she was pleased with. Key rings and pens are 3.99 euros. Bought a few. If you buy from outside Disney near the village, Eiffel Tower key rings haggal and they will give u a bargin. I bought 5 key rings for 1 euro. The towers with lights are 5 euro but he gave me 7 for 20 euro. LolIf it's ur first time u will love it but if it's ur second time u will see a lot of it has NOT improved. Same with studio all the shows are not the same they should hav been even better but they cut corners.","Neutral"
"I have just returned from our third visit to Disneyland Paris.In the past, we have really enjoyed our visits.I travelled with two young sons ages 5 and 7, my husband and mother in law.My youngest son is autistic, and our main reason to visit this year was for the marvel avengers summer of fun.We were extremely disappointed to find, that in order to visit with Captain America, the incredibles, and any Toy Story character, you had to download an app, and book a slot.I downloaded the dais app, and tried to book a place, only to find the line full for the day. I was told I needed to be in the park at exactly 10.45 when the app opened for bookings. I tried to do this on three consecutive days. I had hell trying to get a slot. As soon as it struck 10.45am everyone in the park was trying to access the app, meaning that it repeatedly crashed and was very hard to use.On our final day I managed to get a slot with the incredibles. Despite trying for three consecutive days, I wasn   t able to get a slot for Captain America.My autistic son was extremely upset and distressed by this, and I was unable to pacify, or explain to him why he couldn   t see his favourite character.I tried to get help from numerous staff members, who were rude and unhelpful. They didn   t seem to have much knowledge of the app, and were not forthcoming to solve the problem.To say we were upset was an understatement. We paid a lot of money to spend time trying fruitlessly to get a useless app to work, and were left with very upset children.We will not be visiting Disneyland Paris again!!! We will save our money and go to Orlando, where they know the meaning of customer service.","Negative"
"If you've never been to Florida you may still enjoy this but it just doesn't compare. Even the staff aren't the usual friendly Disney staff. My niece had an accident which meant I had to take off her wet clothes, I asked a shop assistant for a carrier bag to put them in to be told no as it was against policy. That act alone knocked off a star for me. I had a poor 4 year old crying and they couldn't even give me a carrier bag for some dirty clothes. What's wrong with you!On the plus side the evening laser show was good although they closed the park really early to set up for it. I don't know I'd this is a regular thing or not. Also parking was a rip off given how much we'd already paid for tickets. Also too much queuing to check bags. There wasn't a line for people without bags.","Negative"
"My husband and I went here on the 26th of April. It was funtastic! We went on a guided tour. I highly recommend the tour. It was about two and a half hours. They show you parts of Disneyland and Disney's Adventure Park. You also get to go on two rides.The guide takes you to the front of the line, so no waiting! We went to the Big Thunder Ranch BBQ. It is an all you can eat barbecued chicken and ribs. Excellent! It is a little pricey but well worth it!","Positive"
"Having been to Disney World Orlando a couple of times now, we thought we had a good idea of how the park would work. In theory, it's all the same, but there is just not the same level of customer experience that you get in America. Lots of long queues, nothing to keep you distracted and lots of pushing in. The Phantom Mansion broke down 2 days running whilst we were in the queue   we were left there in the queue for an hour before anybody thought to tell the customers what was going on, and then only to escort us out. We did complain and they kindly gave us exit passes for the next day (but only after and hour of complaining). To top it off, I was served a coffee that got tipped over me.The resort was as expected   the room clean but tired, but a nice walk to the parks.The food was really nice   the French really are good with food. Unfortunately it was ruined by the free for all at the buffet service style restaurants. Lots of pushing and rudeness by the locals. I know that us Brits get the mickey taken out of us about queuing, but when you are trying to manage vast numbers of people it is needed.I would suggest going to Disneyland Paris first before going to the US ones.","Neutral"

"Great being a  Kid  again. The employees were just wonderful from the time we arrived till the time we left. Each cast member embodied the Disney energy. The creativity of each ride made you want to go back and see it again. The ground displays color of the flowers, especially the character hedge displays. The ground crew who kept the park clean should be commended. We are planning our next trip soon.","Positive"
"Not impressed. Where to start: we had to pay the same price for children as adults (what a ripoff). Had to pay AGAIN to park   15 euros, you'd think the high cos of admission would include this. None of the restaurants accept ticket restaurants, and the food was very poor quality though super expensive. Hugely long queues though perhaps this was to be expected on a weekend in school hols. Ride kept stopping on Buzz Lightyear. Tech problems with Indiana Jones ride also, so had to wait an extra 30 minutes. Didn't have the option to leave the queue either. My daughter waited 40 mins to buy candyfloss   no idea why, the queue wasn't v long   think maybe the vendor had gone off to watch the Parade but didn't tell the customers! And as you had to buy a token elsewhere, if you left the queue you lost your money! Discoveryland was v tatty. Sooo, I certainly wouldn't recommend a trip to Disneyland unless you WANT to see an example of a greedy conglomerate in action.","Negative"
"I came to Disneyland Paris park with very high expectations to see loads and loads of my favorite Disney characters just wondering about the park and to get pictures with them. The only one I got a picture with was Mickey in his backstage room. There are lots of closed rides for refurbishing but we managed to take the rides with very high levels of thrill, those were awsome btw. Don't bother eating at the what looks like cheap restaurants they're not so good nor cheap (a box of pasta with a soda is 12    ), get your own sandwiches or snacks with you. Skip the long lines by entering the single rider lines you'll save loads of time. We really had very high expectations but unfortunatly we were a bit disappointed at the end of the day. Go Orlando instead or come here after 2017 when all refurbishments are done.","Neutral"
"Maybe it is because I am 64, but Disneyland has lost it's magic for me. $17 for parking and $94 to get in is toooooo much when you have to wait 40 minutes for a ride. No discount for seniors! We had to walk to and from our car! I will not come again.","Negative"
"I've been to WDW many times and I was a little worried by other peoples reviews before going to Disneyland Paris. I can tell you it is still just as MAGICAL. The staff are incredible, I found them all very helpful! Always cheery and everyone we met made a massive fuss over everyone. The rides were brilliant, the park was incredibly clean and everywhere we ate was excellent, if staying for a few days definitely consider the dinning plan, half board is way more than sufficient the portion sizes are big. Do not hesitate if you are worried it won't live up to WDW it is different but its fun different. It is certainly not inferior just smaller. Still as crammed full of incredible Disney magic.","Positive"
"Quite disappointed to find a lot of rides closed for refurbishment. Number of rides less than expected even without the closures. Fast Pass system works well were available. Food very expensive and uninspiring ,very poor for vegetarians. Took our own the second day which worked much better. Park felt safe due to the airport style bag checks. Fewer characters in costume around than expected, most involved an organised queue for photos with them. Buildings very attractive and everywhere was clean. We spent some time in both parks each day.","Neutral"
"Sorry to have to say this, but this was a massive disappointment. We were all really excited about going to Disneyland Paris and yes certain things were lovely and magical....thunder mountain, space mountain, star wars, Mississippi steam boat, haunted mansion, the shows (Tarzan & the parades). We are normally positive people and look for the good things but we really struggled with this. We knew it was going to be busy but I have been before in August and I am sure this time they have legally let too many people in! The queues were unbelievable (what they need are more fast pass rides), the amount of rude people was overwhelming (my little boy was getting quite upset at this) and smokers were everywhere (where were the designated smoking areas). However, what ruined it for us was the extortionate price of everything. I can't believe that Disney who used to stand for everyone having equal fun no matter what your circumstances are would deliberately rob you. A bottle of water 3 euros, a horrible meal in the planet hollywood 100 euros....need I go on. Yes you can top your water bottles up in the park but you can't do that in the studios.Sorry but I would advise you don't go unless you enjoy being ripped off.","Negative"
"Went to Disneyland paris with my 6 yr old daughter 1st week of July and we definitely wont be back. Almost all the rides are for very young children, the queues are ridiculous for such rubbish rides and the amount of adults with no children taking up spaces on the rides was unacceptable. get a life! there werent enough rides that had fastpass availible either.people were also super rude, pushing and shoving and i witnessed 2 grown men in their 30s or 40s screaming and swearing in each others faces over a place in a queue, neither appeared to have children with them. food is awful, had to pay 2    each for bananas for my fruit mad daughter, everything is extremely overpriced for the quality. queues for characters were always really long, i expected to see characters out and about and cant understand why there arent? paid extra for character breakfast, ppl not waiting their turn and jumping in when the character came to my daughter who had sat and waited like she was told, i had photopass but no photographer at the character breakfast so i had to hurriedly take pics myself before they moved on. good points were Mickey and the magician, stitch live, buffalo bills wild west show, aerosmith rock n roller coaster which my 6 year old loved and went on twice, tower of terror, ratatouille and thunder mountain. the thunder mesa river boat was nice too. Glad we went only because now i know we arent missing anything!","Negative"
"What a great place to visit.Simply magical.We liked the shows including the street parades. All really well done.Disliked the boredom while waiting fora ride or show. Surely there can be some entertainment while people wait, which is what Sea World did when we were there","Positive"
"We went there as a family of 3 in August 2012   and were seriously disappointed. Hordes of people everywhere (later told by multiple sources that these were vacationers from mainland China), waiting times of an hour  for rides, made this a horrible experience. Compared this to 4 glorious days spent in Florida Disneyland 3 years back, and felt that this was a big big let down. The park in itself is also small (can be completed in 1 day or 1.5 days at a stretch) Just do not go when there are vacations in mainland China and you should be fine","Neutral"
"Everything makes us happy in the happiest place on earth except for water. 3 dollars and 75 cents for a 20 Oz or 500 ml bottle of water. There are very few drinking water fountains and each of them far away from one another. The fountains are also not hygenic as people put their open mouth on top of the outlet and we can't also use refillable bottles in a fountain. Only thing that's available every 20 feet is the bottled water. Consider the hot summer days(or any day in South California is warm) and we had to buy 10 of these for 2 adults in a day's visit to the park. Disneyland can bring in the water vending machines that distill tap water on the spot plus chilling it and also comes with options to refill water by paying 25 cents per 500ml for example or even less. Cost effective, hygenic, healthy for family and kids and also environmentaly green since it encourages to use refillable bottles and avoids landfill","Negative"

"What a blast! We went the first week of March and none of the lines were over 30 minutes. In fact, we learned the lines were over estimating the wait time so we waited no more than 20 minutes...which we used a fast pass on. We purchased our package through Costco and were extremely satisfied with a few extras they threw in, such as premium character dining for each member of our family. Something we would have splurged on otherwise. Completely worth the experience if taking children. We ate at Goofy's Kitchen and enjoyed the above average buffet style food. I'm not big on buffets, but this one was enjoyable.","Positive"
"Disney has been described as the happiest place on earth. I think Orlando Florida may be more impressive, but the park in Anaheim is the original. yes.. waiting in line is a drag but the connection to films and current entertainment has helped to modernize what was already a classic product. I am not a big fan or waiting in line but its great for family and friends. And even though you no longer get in free on your birthday   its still some place everyone should go at least once.","Positive"

Nice touch!Park   not the biggest of a Disney parks, one main ride per area plus some smaller ones. The castle is quite small (and at Oct 18 was undergoing maintenance and boarded up which was a shame). Some rides we hadn   t been on at other Disney parks.   The haunted mansion was actually quite good.   Iron Man the screen was blurred so didn   t rate it.   very clean and good staff  guests are all polite and everyone queues...I only mention this as this is not the same in eurodisney!","Neutral"
"Must admit I have not been that impressed with this attraction and that is the main reason I never visit this place until last December. Turns out to be an enjoyable outing. Albeit being small in size, it does have good stuff like the parade, Toy Story, Lion King and Winnie the Pooh. The most impressive of all is the fireworks at closing time. That is so unreal! We were very happy that we went in the afternoon and stayed for the fireworks, before departing for the airport after that. Visit and see it for yourself!","Positive"
"My family and I normally love Disney, and infact have Annual passes, however I have just returned after experiencing the worst customer service I have ever experienced there.While I was there with my family for New Years Eve I went into City Hall and asked if Jedi training would be coming back for Season of the Force, and I was told YES. So as soon as we got home i booked to return 6 weeks later with my daughter who has wanted to do Jedi training since they cancelled it before she became 7.As you can imagine my daughter was very excited to be going back to experience the Jedi training, and took it very badly when we arrived in Discoveryland to find out it wasn't on. I went straight to City Hall to complain as that was the only reason we went back so soon, to be told  Yes it was planned but then we cancelled it, if you would have checked online you would have seen that it was cancelled  (which I can't find any mention of a cancelation anywhere) and that  There are other Starwars animations and shows , which didn't really make up for the money I spent to get there! Don't think I'm the sort of person who expects compensation or anything like that, but I was shocked at the fact that even though I had explained to the the member of staff in City Hall the fact I was on a holiday I didn't need to be on, and where I'd left my wife at home with a our youngest daughter, all they could say was,  Sorry about that .So just be wared that they can cancel planned events without informing you, all of this after raising the price of our Annual passes by    150 each!","Negative"
"This is the 2nd time I am visiting this place. I was equally excited to go there again. My 4 year old loved it . He was at awe in most of the places. Must go for family with young kids. One good thing is that you can but your tickets at the parking lot before you get up on the shuttle. There are plenty of places to eat . Very clean everywhere","Positive"
"Great holiday, great rides, great fun!Love this park so much so much to do for all ages groups, shops are fantastic. Couple of downsides, lots of smoking and pushing and shoving, sadly nothing disney can so much about. Also illuminations is a bit disapointing, unless your head on to the castle, the show is rubbish, and if u want a head on view, you will need to stay in 1 spot 2 3hours prior, which is ridiculous","Positive"
"Drove 5  hours to Paris to take kids to Disneyland. Access to park was in good organization (long walk though for kids), but the number of people was toooooo much! My kids hardly got a chance to have decent rides. Waiting times ranging between 45 minutes and 2 hours. Unfortunately, we have paid a lot to travel and get to the park only for their disappointment as they couldn't stand the long lines and the high temperatures. Why kids don't take priority in the rides? Why families with infants don't get priorities? If you are allowing to many people in, then would you increase the number of  good  attractions to split time over them?I would stick for NL famous park  Afteling  next time to have better family quality fun and time.","Negative"
"Having been to Florida and Paris Disney land previous to this I would say it is pretty poor. The resort is very small, less than half the rides and more aimed towards small children. I was more disappointed that it wasn't decorated more for Halloween, it had the odd decoration and the themed rides. As it is Disney I thought they would go all out. Good if you haven't been to the other Disneys and have small children.","Negative"
"All in all, the park and studios are good fun if you and your kids don   t mind the constant walking and queuing. Positives: some really good rides and shows (when they   re not being cancelled), including the end of day illuminations. See below for my faves.Negatives: the drinking fountains aren   t shown on the app, most food choices from the various stalls a fast food style rubbish, you can   t get a decent coffee anywhere (McDonalds was the best    I can   t believe I just wrote that but it   s true); Magic Time (for Disney Hotel guests) is helpful but not all rides are available at that time. And, as you might expect, everything is massively overpriced. Feel that Disney Magic in your wallet!Really negatives: disgusting blocked toilets in more than one location; very poor experience with the Disney hotel (Cheyenne) which put a downer on the holiday.HINTS: the app, while being very far from perfect, is worthwhile having as the queue times are broadly correct (most of the time) and use the Fast Pass system to help skip past the worst of the queues.Best rides for adults and older kids: Tower of terror (scary!), hyperspace mountain, rock and roller coaster and big thunder mountain.Best riders for younger kids (6 ish in our cases, although we all enjoyed these): Ratatouille, Star Wars Tour, the Circus train thing at the top of the park, it   s a small world, Pirates of the CaribbeanBest shows: Mickey and the Magician, end of day illuminations, Moteurs Action and the Studio Tram tour. Pirates and Princesses parade was pretty good too, wasn   t impressed by the Pirate show.","Negative"
"Went on a weekday with my daughter. Crowded.  A lot of people not queue uo properly.  The food was very expensive.  Not a fun day at the Disney.","Negative"
"Oh dear, where do I start ?Stayed at Hotel New York for 3 nights between Xmas and New Year and found the hotel ok   our room was on the ground floor facing the ice rink and although there was music played for the skaters to skate too, we could hardly hear it from our room. The room itself was tatty with wallpaper peeling away everywhere and with a few areas of graffiti which seemed to be the work of an over excited child   the bathroom was again ok, but the sealant around the bath seemed to be mouldy, the grout in need a good scrub and the wallpaper needing replacing. We only had one evening meal, in the Parkside restaurant, which was a disappointing all you can eat buffet   the only half decent component was the lamb   the 'beef' meatballs did not taste like beef and there were too many fish dishes. The only hot vegetables were french beans and small potatoes ! At 32 euros for an adult and 17 for a child, this seemed expensive but then that's typical throughout Disney Parks . . . oh and 5 euros for a can of coke   fanta is ridiculously overpriced (the adult meals do not include drinks !)Onto the parks . . . the days we visited it seemed the 'extra magic hours' were pointless   Space Mountain didn't open until 9, Big Thunder Mountain was shut so there was little value in the extra hour whatsoever ! MGM Studios faired even worse   we spent 1.5 hours queuing for Crush's coaster to then be told that there was a fault on the ride . . . off we trudged to the Studio Tour where we waited for 60 minutes to be told that there was a fault with the main attraction and therefore the ride had to close. To experience one disappointment after waiting for so long is bad, but to experience 2 is unacceptable, especially when you have 2 young children who have waited patiently   it's these little people who remember most, and we left the park at 11am as crowds were ridiculously busy and ride wait times were a minimum of 100 minutes . . . so, having spent the best part of 350 Euros for the days tickets, all we had was 2.5 hours of waiting in queues to show for it   not great value for money !!!!We left Paris vowing to never return and the children left deeply disappointed and upset that they could not enjoy what should have been a fun vacation   their lasting memory will be that they could never achieve the fun which they had set out to experience . . . as adults, our lasting memory will be that brand Disney is falling way short of the expectations it should be setting itself, and we saw a side which is glaringly apparent that the company is reaping huge amounts of profits, on overpriced goods without the necessary re investment.We will NEVER return","Negative"
"I m sorry to write this terrible review. But I m done with Disneyland. Told my kids the next time they come to Disney, they ll be old enough to bring them self lolOk I bought our tickets on the Internet. And payed 3.00     to send to address. First thing I notice there was no date on the ticket. Just it's valid for 1 year. Ok that sound good I thought. We had planed to go on my daughter birthday 28th. We arrived and they said the tickets wasn't Valid , go to the ticket office. Ok already wired that I have to go do ticket boot when the whole thing about buying tickets on line is not to do that right? Here comes the interesting part :) apparently my tickets is valid only September and it's called mini some kind of special offer that I didn't asked for. And that I had to pay extra fee if I wanted to enter on that day! On my bill there is no where it's written that it's for September or it's a special mini tickets. Nothing at all! There is nobody you can talk to. She said I should go on the website to complain or ask for refund.anyway I end up paying the full amount. It was my daughter birthday. No need to book on line in the first place. 400    I payed and we did 8 attractions. 1 hour waiting time! Why in the world would anyone want to go through that!tired kids , tired parents just less then a minute ride. ??So please be carful when you book on line. And good luck","Negative"
"The original Disneyland Park is still worth a visit. Super crowded even during weekdays. Almost all of the rides have a long wait of roughly 90 100 minutes, so Fast Lane is totally worth it. Try all the food stalls (Churros, Corn Dogs, Mickey Pretzel, Mickey Ice Cream). Fireworks starts at 9:30pm. Not many characters roaming around the Park and the night carnival won't start until April, which is a big downside. Fried chicken at Plaza Inn is a must try!","Positive"
"The park is smaller than Orlando, but is in the center of the town and has the main attractions you get at the park in Florida.  Its worth planning to visit multiple days to get the best value tickets","Positive"
"It was a sunny day when I arrived at Disneyland HK. Nowhere to shelter from the Sun. The queue for games was long despite it was just an ordinary Tuesday.  The gift shop was nice. some of the items was overprice, but hey it's Disneyland.","Neutral"
"First trip to Disney parks for the kids and we used the services of their VIP Tour as we could only spend a day park hopping between the two properties. Huge lifesaver during the Summer holidays as it basically works as a permanent express pass, allowing our group to bypass all lines for all rides.In just one day we managed to negotiate the entirety of Disneyland and most of California Adventures, including all the main rides and attractions. Lines for the big rides were averaging more than one hour so this was the most efficient way to see and do everything with the bonus of a great guide who could explain the history of the parks and attractions.Can't wait to come back in a few years time when Star Wars land opens   obviously the existing retooled rides were a huge draw and I can imagine Star Wars doing for Disneyland what Harry Potter has become for Universal","Positive"
"Me, My wife and my 14month old son went to Disney and Paris for 4 days over the late May Bank Holiday weekend. We spent time at both parks (Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney Studios). Given that our son is still young, we thought that this would be a perfect opportunity for all of us to have a good time in that we could do kiddie stuff whilst he was up and go on the adult rides whilst he had his naps. Here is our experience.    Baby Unfriendly   this park is not particularly baby friendly. Note that pushchairs are not allowed in any queues for rides or attractions and nor are they allowed inside for any of the shows. What this means is that if your baby is sleeping in his pushchair (and you don   t want to wake him up), you are stuck since you can   t join any queues. Disney have a clever concept called    Baby switch    whereby if you are parents with a baby it allows you to queue up and then take it in turns to go on the ride (with the other person looking after the baby). Nice idea if executed properly. What these buffoons at Disneyland Paris do is only allow one parent to queue whilst the other parent (with the baby) waits at the exit. Once the first parent has been on the ride (after queuing for say 1 2 hours on their own), then the other parent can go on the ride without queuing. Whichever genius thought of this didn   t realize that maybe if parents are on a    family    day out holiday, they probably don   t want to stay apart for the bulk of this period. Note: even if the baby is awake, you are not allowed to carry him in the queue.    Thrill Rides   As an adult, there is one decent ride that you could call a    thrill ride    and that is the Rock   N   Rollercoaster in Walt Disney Studios (which is excellent). The remainder of the rides were absolutely rubbish and I can say that none of them come even close to Nemesis, Air or Oblivion at Alton Towers. If you are an adrenalin junky     this is not the place.    Disney Characters     There is very little of the Disney    Magic    here     you can walk around for hours without seeing a single character, and the characters are mainly scheduled to be in certain places at certain times (e.g. parades). Would it be too difficult to have characters constantly walking around in the park     we are in Disneyland for gods    sake     I don   t think having characters actually around will demean the brand!    Staff     With few exceptions, the staff were rude and unhelpful. I asked a popcorn vendor for the location of the    Pirates of the Caribbean    ride (which is a big attraction and was actually about a 100 yards from where he was standing)     he just stared at me and said he didn   t know. We asked members of staff for the times of the English version of the Disney Play House show. After being fobbed off all day, at 5.30pm we were told that there were no shows that day in English due to technical reasons.    Although we were fortunate, we did bump into other people who said that they had been on 2 3 rides which had suffered from technical problems.    Smoking     they need to make this park a no smoking zone     it is pathetic to see smoke bellowing out everywhere, especially with children around.    Cleanliness     toilets were dirty, cutlery was not cleaned properly, generally untidy.    Queues     It is amazing how many people would jump queues (I am talking about teenagers   .and their parents!!)     try that in England and there will be fights!!Overall you don   t really get the feeling on any    Magic    here     the place is dirty, with unhelpful and unfriendly staff and is grossly overpriced. Although some of the shows are very good (e.g. the stunts show in Walt Disney Studios), overall it is not much of an experience. Maybe France isn   t the country that embodies the Disney culture and hence was always doomed to fail.I could go on   but I wont. My advice would be to go to Alton Towers, Gullivers Kingdom or Legoland in the UK (depending on what it is that you are after) and give this pathetic excuse of a Disney park a miss   OR save up for the real Disneyland which I have been informed by my wife is actually amazing.","Negative"
"We went to Disneyland for the Halloween party after having the best time ever at the Disneyworld one last year. What a huge difference between the two parks. We were so dissapointed in Disneyland. We feel that the promiced a great time, but didn't deliver. However, it is Disneyland, so it wasn't terrible. Many of the rides were closed so they could decorate for Christmas, but I wish they would have told us which ones. Lines were very long, signs would state 10 min wait, but real wait over half an hour. I'm sure that had we had all day to play and wait it would have been different, but we didn't. I was also upset that there were so few photopass pictures available. The ones that were there has massive lines and after waiting in one for 20 mins we were told that they were done and that we could take our own picture if we wanted. If I wanted that, I wouldn't have prepaid for a photopass. I was over charged for tickets, not given the prepaid price and we were told we would have to file for a refund, rebuy the tickets while we waited on a refund IF we were approved, except that we couldn't do that because it was sold out. We have been to Disneyworld many times and have always been amazed by how great it is. We won't be back to Disneyland. They really need to be more upfront about what is and what is not available after the park closes and it's open for the party only. Very little food, no photos, no autographs, etc. This was a major bummer.","Neutral"
"Great park!  Went there with 2 kids   6 and 11.  Matterhorn was a lot of fun, and also the Star Wars adventure.","Positive"
"My family is a BIG Disney fan and we decided to spend 1 day during our European vacation at the Disneyland Paris. My kids were so excited for months but after our visit, I wish we used our time & money elsewhere. Of course, the Paris version doesn't compare to the original in Anaheim, CA or Orlando. Off the bat, the magic was ruined with the smokers all over the park. Yes, I understand this is part of the culture but it bothered me that smoking was worse than walking the Paris streets. Many of the attractions were closed due to construction. On top of that, there were many rides that were closed due to technical glitches. That doesn't leave a lot of rides to go on and you're fighting with everyone else in the park for the rides that did work. The park wasn't as clean as I would've expected and the bathrooms were a mess and smelly! I only found 1 thing that was the same as American parks: the prices for sub par food.","Negative"
"While better than an average amusement park, Disneyland is missing the special something that sets Disney World apart from all others.  The service and the magic just aren't there.  Glad we visited, but I'd always choose Disney World in the future.","Positive"
"Disneyland Parc Paris is beautiful. Hands down Europe's best themepark. Definitely worth a visit to the park.","Positive"

"We live in Japan and decided to hop over to Hong Kong and check out Hong Kong Disneyland. We went to Hong Kong Disneyland with two kids ages 7 and 4. The actual entrance is down a long pathway that takes 10 minutes to get to from the hotel drop off point. We were told the park opened at 10:30 so we arrived 45 minutes before rope drop time. But we when got there, people were already allowed into the park. Which was strange. We went on a weekday and even though the park opened at 1030. Toy Story land didn't open until 11 and closed early at 8. Many restaurants were closed but we weren't sure if they were closed because it was a weekday. We wanted to eat at Explores Club restaurant but it didn't open until 12. We notice many snack food stands did not open until 12. We rented a stroller inside the park which cost $100HKD   $100HKD deposit you will get back when you return the stroller. If you want to do Jedi Training for ages 4 12 do the sign up first thing when you get in because it will get full. We bought tickets at DisneyLand Hollywood Hotel the night before. We generally don't go to the most popular rides first we went until the end of the night when the crowds die down and there isn't a huge wait. One of the most popular rides is The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh that is also a FP but we opted to go right after the night parade and the wait was only 15 minutes. The Buzz Light Year ride we went right before the firework show at 8:50 and there was no wait. The kids loved ToyStory land and went right when it opened at 11 and we waited only 5 minutes for the rides. You are allowed to bring in food and drinks. Personal space does not exist and people will be literally on top of you when you are in line. We watched Festival of the Lion King which is great and we waited outside. We didn't understand why we couldn't wait inside the air conditioned theatre. People will try and cut in line so beware. Our little 4 year got pushed by adults because she walked too slow. We had to carry her prior to waiting for shows because she almost got trampled. Would I recommend going to Hong Kong Disneyland? No. If you have a chance go to Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea. Even though it crowded people are polite and wait their turn.","Negative"
"I am 28 years old and i love disney!!I waited for that day to come to disney and went there with a hugh smile on my face hoped to be the fantasy i was waiting for but disney totally broke my heart !!! Yes the place is kind of a fantasy but we had to wait at least an hour to ride the interesting attraction and sometimes more than that so for the whole day we rid on only 5 attractions! The place is full with very expensive resturants and souviners shops! Nothing like i imagined, definetly had enough for one day! Thank god i bought the one day ticket! The best and only good thing was the firework at the end of the day was worth the waiting ! I imagined to see princesses and mickey mouse and i saw nothing!!The place is good for the young kids ... where the hell are the princesses and where the hell was mickey mouse hiding? I guess he was sick that day...I recommend downloading the app before arriving it helps knowing how much is the waiting time for each attraction...","Neutral"
"I spent 3 days visiting most of the components of the big  campus . My two daughters 8 10 were super excited about the park and the attractions, while me and my wife not so impressed. In addition several times in the two days we got  technical problems  after a long queue and it's not so easy to explain to children.The two hours opening before the others with Hotel it's not so good, as most of the attractions are not available.Overall is good, but I removed one start due to the balance between cost and quality .","Neutral"
"how can you give Disneyland anything less than 5 stars? It's the Happiest Place On Earth for a reason.......:)I HIGHLY recommend getting out of bed early and getting there RIGHT when it opens. You'll do more in your first 2 hours then you probably will the rest of the day. Seriously, I promise you it's worth it. I also recommend closing the park down and going on the Matterhorn when the fireworks are going off at night, it's SO amazing to pop in and out of the dark tunnels with the fireworks illuminating the sky.","Positive"
"I love Disneyland but I wouldn't recommend Hongkong Disneyland.The reasons are:1. The staffs in Hongkong Disneyland not good like Disneyland or disneysea tokyo. They're very rude n not polite. Difficult to speak in English.2. Better I went to Dufan Jakarta than Disneyland Hongkong. I heard staff shouting the people who lining the attraction.3. No smile from the Disneyland Hongkong staff.","Negative"

"You hope Disney at Christmas would be magical and for our children it was everything they had hoped for and expected. Decorated in Disney's unique and magical way with the extra Disney at Christmas parade, they really did have a memorable and fantastic time. We visited at the start of December in the wake of the attacks in Paris and so the park was quieter for a fews days than what we perhaps would have expected but it was good to see Disney takes the safety of the visitors seriously with a number of visible additional security measures. On the whole we were not disappointed with Disneyland at Christmas, the only thing worth commenting about is that a few of the family favorites such as Thunder Mountain and It's a Small World were closed. And of course they still got to see the big guy!","Positive"
"Long Queue's for rides which I can except but the 1hr queue for  Fast Food  not expectable. The theme seemed to be not enough staff of concession stands. Even when we ate at the more up market restaurants (California grill and Chez Remy) we still had a good half hour wait from being seated despite having a reservation and eating the fixed menu at the California grill. For a fine dining experience not good enough in my view. ","Negative"
"Was a good experience, but too busy. The wait for rides was too long with young children. The magic morning was very disappointing you get in an hour early, but only one section of the park was open, they rope off the other areas then theres a stampede on opening.","Neutral"
"This park is super at making young dreams come true. Most of the cast members are welcoming and happy. The meet and greet were just fantastic for our 5 year old granddaughter. The park food is seriously overpriced as are the many shops. The rides cater for all ages and are great fun. The main park is just beautiful, the studios less so. There is no shortage of toilets and generally very clean.The not so good points are that personal space is constantly invaded by rude people, who do not generally know how to apologise, far too many smokers in non smoking areas and nothing is done about it, queuing seems to be an issue for people on the continent.We used various food outlets and all were reasonable and some infact were good, chose wisely your time to eat Make use of the fast passes for the busier rides.If you can purchase an infinity pass which gives you a whole range of benefits.All in all a good if vastly overpriced place to visit.","Positive"
"This is a great Disney to introduce kids too. It's not to big easily done in 4 6hrs. The day we went there was no night parade and fire works which must have kept the crowds away as we didn't not wait longer than 20 minutes on any ride. This was lovely with a 7 & 9 yr old.Kids had a blast.Next time it's LA","Positive"
"We decided to try out Disneyland since we usually go to Disney World. It was very fun! Park was clean and we loved the short lines for the rides (being off season). We loved the Haunted Mansion Holiday overlay and Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy. The park was decorated so nice for Halloween. It's fun to ride the different rides between WDW and DL. We also love Matterhorn. We did Mickey's Halloween Party while we were there and we really enjoyed it. We loved the trick or treating and the parade. It was a blast and we would do the party again! We will definitely come back to Disneyland! ","Positive"
"I've always heard that Florida's Disney World is better than Disney Land. Disney World is a bigger park, I guess the bonus to Disney Land is being in California and enjoying some of the other sites. My daughter had a good time nonetheless.","Positive"
"Went to Disneyland as a party of 3 adults and 3 children under 11. Thoroughly enjoyed most of our visit.Not able to gain admission until 10am to any of the rides. I suggest you get to the park before 10am and make your way to your favourite rides immediately as within an hour there can be over an hours wait for a ride that lasts 3 minutes.Dont expect to get any cheap or healthy food we paid 23 euros for an adult buffet and 15 euros for the children.Missed the parade and fireworks as too tired. If you want to do these, the parade is at 7pm weather permitting and the fireworks at closing time. Go back to your hotel in the afternoon for a rest then re enter the park before 7pm.Make sure when you enter the park not only get a map of the area but also a programme then you can plan your day around meeting the disney characters and parades.All in all a good experience.","Positive"
"It's my first time in Hong Kong Disneyland and it is more expensive than the Tokyo one. The price gone up just 2 days before our visit.Nothing special if you've been to Disneyland in other part of the world. The good thing is the average queueing time was about 20 minutes compared to my last visit in Tokyo which we wait for at least 30 minutes or more for most ride.","Neutral"
"I love Disneyland. Been to California, Orlando, Tokyo, Paris & off to Disneyland Hong Kong in 3 weeks. My husband and our 2   year old daughter, this was their first visit to Disneyland Park. We were staying in Hollywood and took a local shuttle company to the park. The pick up for the return trip is 8pm, so you can see the parade. By the time you pay for admission, morning tea, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, Minnie Mouse ears, a Mickey Mouse soft toy, photos taken by the park photographers and the other souvenirs, it is a very expensive day. By the end of the day, we were tired from queuing for rides, chasing characters, and we just wanted to get a good spot for the parade and sit and wait. The parade started at 7pm, but we didn   t see the parade. The lead float with Mickey broke down. Then they bought in a new tow truck, but that didn   t work, then they bought in a another two vehicle, but we don   t know if the parade started or not, as we had to do the dash to get our shuttle bus back to Hollywood otherwise it is a long & expensive taxi ride. I did ring guest experiences the next day to complain, but to be told that these things happen. Well my husband and I are military, and there is no excuse for this, and besides I am very confident that Disney makes a lot of money. We had come a long way, we are in the US for a month visiting many cities and sights and the lady on the phone was sympathetic to my complaint. A great day, but eveyone knows that the parade is the best part. Hopefully Hong Kong Disneyland can give us a magical parade.","Neutral"
"Sure there seemed to be more technical problems on the rides than we have experienced at WDW. Yes   the no smoking policy should be immediately enforced as the number of smokers and resultant garbage is disgusting. It was also rare to come across a  cast member  who was invested in enriching our experience. But the magic of Disney still comes through. My husband and I went ourselves on my 50th birthday trip and we had a blast. It was fun to compare the attractions to those at WDW which we have visited several times. Phantom Manor was very cool and Thunder Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean better than their WDW counterparts. We got a 2 park ticket and enjoyed Twilight Zone of Terror and Ratatouille at the Studios amongst others. There is a significant smaller children section here.The train service from Paris on the RER A is excellent and delivers you right to the entrance of the park. It was a last minute idea to go so we bought our tickets at the park   took only 10 minutes or so. We were also lucky to never wait more than 20 minutes for a ride although our longest line was waiting to get a Fast Pass for Thunder Mountain! And alas   Peter Pan's Flight was clogged as it always is and ran out of FP early. I think if you go with a positive attitude ready to have fun you will.","Positive"
"We went to Disneyland on 11 23 11 so that the holiday decorations would already be in place. We had such a great time   the parade is always great, the fireworks show...wow, what a production (you need to find your spot in front of the castle pretty early as they do a light show projected onto the castle with the fireworks behind it) and Fantasmic (reserve your spot early too) all worth the wait. BTW, the turkey leg was delicious   2 huge turkey legs fed 2 adults and 2 kids.My daughter lost her spacial Disney hat while on the Matterhorn Bobsled. They told me to fill out a form at city hall (entrance of the park) since they go through and collect items when the park closes. I called 3 days later and was so happy to hear they found it and will be mailing it to me   Thank you very much!!!!!!!!","Positive"
"I have had the chance to go to a few Disney Park in the US and in France. I have to say the HK one is extremely disappointing. I would not recommend it if not for families with very young children.","Negative"
"Visited over the Easter holidays. We were very disappointed to find about a quarter of the rides closed for repair work, including some of our childrens' favourites. No characters roaming around (you have to queue for an hour to have a photo if one is around). Despite the rain, queues we far too long (average was 45 minutes, longest was 90 minutes). There must be a better way...","Neutral"
"We recently returned from our family trip to Disneyland. While Disney does a good job of creating a fantasy vacation, they definitely know what it means to have a monopoly. We stayed in the Grand Californian and found it impossible to have even a simple snack without spending at least $10 per person. I was shocked when a small individual serving size orange juice bottle was over $4 !! A breakfast sandwich in nearby downtown Disney (most likely with every vendor owned by Disney) was $9. Yes, that's right $9!! What you would pay $2 for in the outside world was more than 4x's the price.Here is the problem. You get to the park, your family is having fun enjoying the rides and then someone mentions they are hungry. You have to feed them, no choice, and Disney knows it. Our small family of 3 averaged more than $100 daily just to have simple meals and drinks while in the park.Then someone wants a sweatshirt, or a toy, or a souvenier of some type. You can't say no! This is a once in a lifetime experience, so you sucumb and allow Disney to violate you again and again and again. All the while, you are trying to justify paying 4 to 5 x's what anything should in reality cost by telling yourself you are at the happiest place on earth and making memories.Heed this warning. If you go to Disneyland or Disney World or anything Disney. Pack a back pack with food each day before you go. Have everyone agree you won't eat more than 1 meal in the park while you are there. Have everyone agree you won't purchase more than one souvenier and that the price of that item will not exceed x $'s.While the Grand Californian is a beautiful hotel, it is there to rob you of your hard earned cash just like the rest of the Disney regime. If you have a spouse who wants to stay in this hotel, insist that it be for only a single night and then stay at a nearby non Disney hotel for a fraction of the cost.Frankly, I would have really enjoyed the 4 days we spent in the theme parks if I didn't have to work for the next 2 months just to pay for the experience. Don't be another Disney victim. Let common sense prevail and you will make great memories and be able to look proudly at your bank account when it is all over.","Negative"

"don't waste your money, feel like we paid 150 euros for 2 straw hats, only bit of the show food that was enjoyable. Chose premier seating, told to turn up 1hr before show was due to start, thinking we'd be able eat before the show, NO!!!! just bunched together like cattle for an hour, in not a very large space..but oh yes the bar was there for you to BUY drinks..15min pre show???? NO ONE WAS INTERESTED. Once in arena shovelled into rows of people. Food was then served as show was in progress, some of the time in very dark lighting, which wasn't a bad thing in some ways as you couldn't really see what you were eating, but if you were hungry..you'd want to eat, but then then show was going on so what did you focus on, bad food, bad show???. And what a waste of food, how ever BAD. really please don't waste your money..the show isn't really worth it, and the food is appalling. All we came away with is 2 straw hats!!! Would not reccommend this show at all. Rest of Disneyland would say it's fine if you like queueing, amazing structures, and lots to see but make sure you plan what you want to do, and would highly suggest that you spread the day out between seeing what's around and a few shows otherwise you're feet might feel like they want to fall off...but please don't waste 75 euros per person on the Wild West Show.","Neutral"
"We were so excited to come to Disneyland. We took our kids to Disneyworld 2yrs ago and enjoyed that more. We only came because it was the original park. We found everything was over priced for what it was wether it be souviners or food. Lines were long very over crowded and we lined up for some rides for over an hour to get told it was experiencing problems so we'd have to wait again. I don't think adults with no kids should be allowed a fast past for the kids rides Dumbo etc. Over all we can say as a family of 10 been there done it NEVER AGAIN","Neutral"
"If you like being ripped off by Disney merchandise shops then this is the place for you; there are plenty of them. The Disney Village is free entry to a whole host of restaurants and not much else. Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios are what you pay for. There are some good major attractions in the park and the Studios. The Park is fantastic for young kids and the Studio's for older kids. But they'll get bored quite quickly. A day is all that's needed (if it wasn't for the queues). I went for the new year's eve (2004) 'spectacular.' The only thing spectacular was the crowd. There was no limit to the amount of people they let in to Main Street USA, where everybody wanted to be, with no alternative exits. The amount of idiots with pushchairs (and double pushchairs) made matters worse. The resulting crush was unbeleivable and the show wasn't worth the hassle.If you're staying in one of the Disney hotels your bus ride to and fro is fine as there are plenty of the yellow Disney buses laid on. If you're in one of the four outlying hotels be prepared for mass hysteria as everyone in the four hotels tries to cram on to one of only two purple PEP buses that serve them. No one seems to care how many kids get crushed or trampled as they try to get on the bus. There is no system for getting a bus so it just turns into a free for all as people queue jump and knock other people to the floor.Go to the US parks, its much easier, better, and more value for money.","Negative"
"Our experience at Disneyland Paris was, in one word, weird. I suppose we came expecting the same Disney Magic that is present at Disneyworld, but these two places simply aren   t comparable. For what it is, it   s nice, I suppose. It has the rides and the characters and the shows and all that jazz, but I would suggest that American tourists skip it. For a few reasons:  You   ll have to take a whole say out of your Paris itinerary to fit this in. It   s not worth it. We are Disney fanatics if there ever were any, but there is more magic in the heart of Paris than here.  Lines are long; we rode maybe 4 5 rides during our entire day there.  The place is outdated. We rode the    new    space mountain. Thing looks like it was built in 1995.  WHERE IS THE FOOD? This one confused me. We wandered the park, from about 7:00 to 9:00, searching tirelessly for food. Restaurant after restaurant was temporarily closed (and there was no way of funding this out before you arrived there) and we were there on a Sunday in June. We hadn   t eaten much all day, and I was internally begging,    Someone please, take my money and give me sustenance!    We finally found one cafe, and we waited in line for no less than an hour for our overpriced cold pizza and sour pasta salad that tasted great after our eternal quest.Overall, if you   ve flown across the world to come to Paris, spend your extra day at Versailles or in the gardens or museums. We   ve got Disney back home, and it   s infinitely better than this Six Flags Posing as Disney    la France.Also, the fireworks aren   t fireworks. It   s a light show. It   s legit, but it   s not fireworks.","Neutral"

"Started out rough. I didn't know Space Mountain was closed. Then I find out Big Thunder Mountain was temporarily closed for improvements. Then the Indiana Jones ride broke down. So, I went to City Hall to complain about 3 out of the 5 thrill rides being closed. I wanted a partial refund. While I was there, the employee told me that Big Thunder had just opened an hour before I showed up at City Hall, and that Indiana Jones was now operational. Had I known about the closures, I would have made different decisions. That said, the employee was very understanding and gave us 3 Fast Passes for my family. So, that made up for the frustrations. Disneyland did a good job keeping me happy and our family ended up having a very fun time.","Positive"
"I guess I'm just not a Disneyland fan. In my opinion the park is grossly over priced, over crowded, and over rated.I could handle the price if it wasn't so crowded. The wait time for the rides are unacceptable. Because of the long wait times there just isn't enough time in the day to get on many rides making it a poor value. The food, drink, and souvenirs are grossly over priced. I only went because my wife had never been. We won't go again.","Negative"
"Everywhere you looked there was something exciting and trilling to see and do. The lines moved fast making the experience more enjoyable. The atmosphere was great full of excitement. the staff were all so friendly.","Positive"
"Sure, after Anaheim, this park is small. But so much fun. We travelled with our 3 year old and it was perfect for him. We enjoyed 3 days in the park. You can't quite see everything in 1 day   2 is perfect and 3 just gave us the luxury of time to see everything with time to spare. We were blown away by the shows   Mickey and the Wonderous Book and The Lion King are incredible. Skip Moana if you are on a schedule. Rides aren't that thrilling, but definitely good fun. Disney has this amazing knack for making kids rides that are fun for adults too! Toy Story Land's parachute drop is the best!! Make sure you get there at rope drop to maximise your time in the park. Food is expensive, but good enough. Choose week days for low crowds   we were there 2nd week of Jan and crowds were good. Take the train (MTR)   it's part of the experience and easy to do with some planning. Saved money by buying tickets on klook   easy to use. Often can get a discount vouchers for shops on main street between 10 and 10.30 while waiting for rope drop for rest of park. They can store your parcels and collect at end of day.Consider booking a character meal (e.g. breakfast at Disney hotel) to get those great character snaps  saves you needing to line up during that precious park time!","Positive"
"I am a So Cal resident and purchased the pass that is the least amount of money (299) it has its blackout dated and it is mostly holiday, weekends and part of the summer. I have enjoyed it so much. It's different, when you have a pass you don't feel like you have to be there when they open and stay until close to get your money's worth. Sometimes, I just go for a few hours. I try and eat before I go and then just purchase a treat, dole whip, pretzel or something like that. It is nice because now Disney allows you to take food inside and drinks. If you are on a budget or just don't want to spend to much, that is the best way. Although, I do enjoy their corn dogs.","Positive"
"I have been to Disneyland 25  times in my life. Hadn't been in about 8 years until last week. I will admit, being the Disney freak I am, I never thought I'd say this but Disneyland is losing its magic. It is evident that Disney isn't putting as much into this park as it is Disney World. I had problems from the moment I tried to make my reservation online with Disney Travel and the checkout wouldn't work. The Official Disneyland APP does not give realistic wait times, the rides were down more than they were up, the cast members don't smile much and frankly most acted like they hated their jobs. The park was not as tidy as I remembered it being (garbage in the landscaping, less than clean bathrooms, etc). The lines for rides aren't managed very well outside the original ride queues so it's hard to actually know where the end of the line is. I do realize with the number of people that come into the park it can be a challenge to manage, but they used to do it well and they do an excellent job of doing it in Orlando, so what's the problem Disney? I've been to Disney World twice and from now on will spend the little extra money and go back there instead of Disneyland. It's a whole different world. Hard to believe they are owned by the same company.","Neutral"
"I am so bummed that our Disneyland trip was sub par. Many parts of the park are closed, including the main st...this is located at the main entrance point of the park and one of the most iconic sections. Large walls lined both sides of the road, forcing patrons to choose which side of main st to walk on. It also caused congestion and took away from the charm of the park. Not to mention the walls were so tall and took up main st from start to finish, you couldn   t even see the Walt Disney statue or castle. Splash Mountain was also closed as they were doing work it. Additionally, parts of Small World and Fantasyland were closed. To be honest you could tell the whole park is going under a revamp. This is something Disney did not explain before going. A part of me feels like we were gipped out of the true experience. I wouldn   t pay to go here until all of the work is complete. I   m sure it will look great in the future but it was very much a let down as I know what the park could offer if all it   s sections were opened. And Disney, if you read this, don   t cheat your customers, let them know about these things ahead of time.","Negative"
"Can't believe it's 25 years...I actually was there 25 years ago on Grand Opening Day.The park (now parks with the Studio) is still a great place to spend a whole day of fun.I booked a 2 parks in 1 day pass and took my nieces.We had lots of fun. They revisited Space Mountain with a Star Wars twist...very well done.The Studio Park has some of the best sensation rides.Always nice to go back.","Positive"
"I am writing this review waiting in line to attraction (60minutes). Disney park is amazing, beautiful paradise of our childhood's dreams. We were inspired by this park 10years ago, when came here first time and had seen all park's attraction in 1 day. This time we were proud to open this paradise for our little kids, who were dreaming about it. But this   time the paradise was lost, our kids said, they do not want to come here again. I believe that Paradise was lost by it's formal management. In order to see all attractions here, one have to spend average 70% of time in waiting to get to attractions. Fast pass: it does not work any more like 10 years ago, fast pass's slots were turned off at 1pm, and to get to all famous attractions you had to wait about 60 minutes on each. Unfortunately we had short vacation and do not have time to spend in Disney land park 3 days(10years ago we managed to explore 100% of attractions in 1 day). I mentioned management,   of course this is the reason of our unsuccessful vacation. I tried to speak with some staff asking advise how to get solution, because we do not have enough time to complete our tour, but received just formal replied like  it is policy for all  . It looks like they care more to be right than to care customers satisfaction. Daughter of our friends asked in the shop the price of some merchandise(she forgot eyeglasses in hotel), but received nervous reply  You have to look the tag! (Seller did not care that it was to dark in pirates shop, and the girl should have problem with her eyes). Conclusion : 1. the park is fantastic , 2. Disney brand is very popular, so it looks like no necessary to improve   management and service which are pour, 3. Need to plan 3 days to stay here to avoid disappointments like we. And be ready to spend to much money for overpriced merchandise; our 7 year old son just studied in primary school topic about  fair trade   he told us that  toys are sold with unfair prices here .   I do not like to write unpleasant reviews, you can see that I had wrote over 200 excellent or good reviews. But this time I feel responsibility to point public attention to this topic, because it concerns childhood. I believe, that it is important to hold the balance between commercial interests and children's happiness. Ps: I asked in reception of hotel if there any option for people who does not have time for multi day visit to pay extra for guaranteed fast pass (like in other brand parks), I received very polite and smily negative and formal reply","Negative"
"Visited Disneyland Paris for 4 days in September 2011. I absolutely loved it, there was so much to see and do. Rides were great and we were lucky that we visited I guess off peak as there wasnt bad queues and if there was a half hour queue we simply used a Fastpass. The park is clean, constantly seeing people sweep up. There are rides and attractions for all ages and all type of riders. The whole place is completely overpriced, charging    4 for a bottle of coke. We learnt after the 1st day to bring our own drinks in! They say they do not allow picnics in the parks and all bags do get searched upon entry but I saw plenty of people still taking snacks in to keep the cost down. We wanted to buy a couple of souvenier photos from the rides which we did, just be prepared to pay around    15 for one.......","Positive"
"I have always loved this place and I have been going to it since I was a child myself but this is my first time I have been with children. I took along side another adult (the children's mother) 2 children a 5 year old and a 9 year old, they both loved it, it was their first time here and it was amazing to see their faces when they saw the castle for the first time, it was priceless. The first day was just going on the well known rides and rides that I knew that both children could go on with no fuss, as it is quite a large park they got tired by mid afternoon but that was ok as we were staying in a Disney Hotel so we could just nip there for a rest. A word of advice if a child, no matter how old they are has never been on a roll a coaster before then DO NOT take them on the Spacemountain Ride, this 9 year old hated it.I arranged for a disney character breakfast at Mickey Cafe and it was the most amazing breakfast I have ever had, and that was me not being able to eat wheat... The characters were wonderful with the children, Tiger tickled them until they ended up on the floor, the chipmunk's danced with them and Goofy came round 2 3 times just to spend time with them. The only thing I would say about it is that the loos were awful, 2 were blocked and leaking dirty water so you had to jump across the puddles to get the 1 clean toilet, but other wise it was amazing.I also arranged for them to have a birthday cake in the hotel and the whole restaurant sang to them which made them have the biggest smile on their faces.The park was clean, not too busy and a happy place to be I would definitely go there again, on my own and with a family.So thats it I hope you enjoyed my last review and this review.","Positive"
"No one understands entertaining huge crowds with vulnerable people a large part of them better than Disney! Absolutely the best. Love the rides with our grandchildren especially Dumbo and the Merry Go Round. Loved the parade. Enjoyed but did not love the food whether it was sit down or stand up. Disney's market, rightly so, is to provide for the most people for as little cost as possible. It is still not cheap but clearly the effort is made. Friendly staff and well maintained property. As long as our grandchildren want to visit, we want to visit. Loved Walt Disney and all he did and love his legacy property.","Positive"
"I am visiting Paris, on limited time?, shall I visit Disneyland Park?Here's 5 steps in making your mind up.1) Disneyland Park is kids' heaven and That   s a fact. If you want to see and make them happy, then GO2) If you have never been to a Disneyland Park, then GO3) If your kids have never been to a Disneyland Park, then bring them and GO4) If you have been to Disneyland Park in US, then you may not enjoy as much here as the park is considerably smaller and you would have seen experienced everything in the US already.5) If you have been to a Disneyland Park in Japan and Hong Kong, then GO. Although the main park is a familiar sight to you, but Disney Studio will keep you interested and excited for the rest of your visit.","Positive"
"I just came back on 22 Apr 2010. It is my first time to disneyland and i will said hong kong disneyland is perfect family outing with children below 12 years old. I stay at disneyland hotel , fantasia room with a jacuzzi (king size bed   1 sofa bed) ...Let me summarized my findings at Airport to disney hotelsIf you traveled with 2 4 peoples, you should go via the cab. It is cheaper than taking MRT and save more time. It only cost around HKG 120 130 per way and 15 minutes to reach the hotel.Disneyland Hotel ... There is 2 hotels   Disneyland hotel (higher rate) and hollywood hotel First I thought paying more to stay at disneyland hotel to get to have more experienced and excitement with my 2 sons but it kinda dissappointed , reason because there is not much pictures wallpapers of disney characters especially mickey .. u hardly see any mickey logo even on the lift or in the room .. and there is not much restaurants in disneyland hotel compare with hollywood hotel ... I did book a breakfast at enchanted garden and we are having a great time especially my 2 kids .. the breakfast time divided to two section, 8.00 9.30am and 10.00 11.30am. During my section, there is 4 characters showing Mickey , Daisy , Goofy and Pluto .. I been told, beside goofy and pluto , the others 2 charaters may be different .. so depends on your luck. And if you staying in disneyland hotel, you should book the breakfast through reception, you get cheaper price. During the breakfast, you hardly eat , but most of the time taking photo as each characters will go to your table at least 1 or 2 times. I went to Hollywood hotel for dinner at chef mickey restaurant... it is a very good place to dine after a whole day trip to the themed park, there is lots of hkg flavoured food , with japanese, indian and others cuisine. I am lucky as I sit beside the walkway and Goofy appeared .. managed to get some photos ...summary , the disneyland hotel is clean, quite and the staff is very friendly .. during check out .. princess Bell (beauty and the beast) appeared and we managed to take some photo with her .. facilities, indoor and outdoor swimming pool , gym , tennis court .. Disney Themed ParkAs I stay at Disneyland hotel , there is a promotion on buy 1 ticket and play for 2 days. As my flight reach there around 1pm, after check in , we went to the themed park around 3.30pm on the first day.. There will be a shuttle bus picking you at disneyland   hollywood hotel to the themed park with frequency of 10 minutes. please note, you cant bring in food or water into the park. while you entering , staff will check your bags. Unless you have infant, water is not allowed. Also please check out how to get the fast pass to avoid long queue. As 3.30pm is the parade, during my admission , most of the peoples already left or back to hotel and to take a rest for the 7.30 fireworks show.I reach into the themed park at 4pm, you will see people queing to take photo with mickey   minnie on the center of main street. it takes me about 15 minutes to Q. Around that time, chip and dale, pluto and goofy also appeared at nearby , but the Q is around 5 minutes ... on the US mainstreet, mostly for shopping , so the first stop you should reach is fantasy land ... you spend more time here .. main attraction is the 3D Movie, dumbo ride, cinderella carousel. And the rest main attraction will be stich, space mountain, light buzzyear shooting. Characters..There will be few spots that the charaters will be appearing depends on time, check out the guidemap .. during my visit (mickey and minnie) (a must queue) , chip and dale, goofy and pluto at main street , at fantasy land there is 4 small booths, individual mickey, minnie, pooh eeyore, goofy . I noticed donald will appear beside the 3D Movies at 5pm. I waitied the next day and donald appeard the same time. tommorow land, light buzzyear and its a small world area there is pinnochio at 5pm. castle area , princess bell and snow white so i suggest you should first go and check out with information or those disney staff to get some tips and charaters appearance.there is few food court available in the themed park. from asian to western cussine.overall. it is a wonderful place for family and i be back next year for sure.","Positive"

"As an avid Disney World fan and past cast member, Disneyland Paris was on my  must do  list during my first trip to Paris. There were many things I loved such as the pirate ship for kids, waterfall out of the pirate skull mouth and the opportunity to explore Sleeping Beauty Castle. The Halloween decorations were cute and the Halloween show on the castle stage was great for kids. I was also surprised at the occupancy level...much lower than I thought but maybe that's because I'm used to WDW. I found the park to be slightly confusing to navigate as there were many more paths to take than expected and the castle, the traditional center of the park meant to be seen from any location, disappeared at times. At about 6 pm on our visit, we decided it was time for dinner and found that 6 of the restaurants (possibly more) weren't available. 3 of them being ones we wanted to try, the other 3 beings one we stumbled across but we closed. Why? Was it occupancy levels? Slow time of the year? That would never be acceptable at WDW. We ended up eating at Hakuna Matata and it wasn't very good. The parade and nighttime show were definitely unique and I was glad to experience that. Overall the visit was disappointing. Maybe my standards are too high because I'm used to WDW but I don't feel as though that should matter. All Disney parks should be held to the same service and performance levels and sadly this park fell short.","Neutral"

"Our family has visited every Disney Park in the US, and looked forward to visit the one In Paris.This was i big disapointment. Several of the main attractions were closed due to maintenance. This caused ques up to three hours on other attractions. Both reservations for dinner was lost, even though we had booked months ago. The food served was terrible and overpriced. We stayed for two nights at the Disney New York Hotel. This was OK. But we were promised two hours exclusive time in the park every morning for Hotel guests. When we turned up, the main areas for teenage kids were not open. A total rippoff!!Paying good money for these days were not worth the hours we spent standing in endless lines.We will never return to Disneyland Paris or Disney Studios.","Negative"
"Unfortunately this park is no longer on my list of local attractions to visit. The value for the price is not equitable. Too many people, ridiculously long lines, poor organization of crowds, attractions being shut down after waiting in line for hours all combine to make this the last trip for us.","Neutral"
"Talking as the experience it was OK, I visited with my cousins (girls 6 and 21 years old) and it was nice, the attractions where ok, I really can't say anything but OK. Talking as a marketing professional it was a disaster!! I hated it! It wasn't original at all, its like a little piece of the orlando park. I was really expecting more european stuff and not go into new orleans or the wild west. It was so much people and there wasn't anything to do but eat, buy stuff or do a 180 minutes line for 2 minutes of fun. In the end I can't say it was a memorable new experience. It was Ok.","Neutral"
"We were really dissapointed in Disneyland, firstly we had to pay over $100 for a 3 year old. The main attraction we wanted to see was Cars, we managed a photo oppoortunity which we later couldn't locate to download from the given website. While the Car Movie itself it targeted to 3 10years the ride is fast and too scary for younger kids I was realy dispoonted the kids didn't have a slow version to ride. The Shifting tractors were also scary for a 3year old although borderline.There weren't many attractions AT ALL that I thought suitable for an under 6 and considering your are paying an adult fee fI'd give this a miss until your children were older","Neutral"

"This was my first experience in Disneyland. I would say it was alritel. The atmosphere and design was so amazing! The little shops on Main Street USA was decorated beautifully with plenty of little souvenirs to buy. The rides that we got onto (Parachute thingo at Toy Story land, buzzlight year thingo and its a small world) was nice, unfortunately the whole park was packed out! took us 40   minutes to line up, We gave up and decided to just shop for toys and souvenirs.Next time, I'll be sure to remember to use the fast pass and come earlier! Got to try the RC coaster, magic mountain and the Gulch ride!","Neutral"
"My next line should be 'and now cancel Christmas' ; )  many people seem to love it but this is my view:Admittedly I'm not particularly in to theme parks but this was a major let down. We managed to keep our negativity away from the kids who said they enjoyed it but I think they couldn't comprehend how little there actually is to do except walk around shops and queue.The first hour was exciting but things turned bad once we started to realised the queues were huge and the rides rubbish.We only got on 2 rides plus the train (UK bank holiday I guess making it busy but as the French schools were back it was worse than expected). The Star Wars ride was poor. Entrance price, food and drink was quite unbelievably overpriced   It was very much like walking around the Trafford Centre and getting your wallet stolen.Yes that's my best description: The place is like a tacky shopping centre with endless overpriced gift shops and hardly anything for the kids to do.","Negative"
"Rides were great but after queuing for an hour and to be told the ride had to close due to technical problems was very very annoying. This happend 3 times in one day so it was very frustrating. Several of the rides were closed at half term which I was surprised at. Food very expensive, no coffee shops .","Negative"
"Pros: If you like Disney stuff you'll have fun at any Disneylands. The Buzz lightyear (laser tag guns) attraction is fun. The Lion King show is really good too.Cons: Lots of rude park guests. One of if not the smallest Disneys. Also, quite far from town (it is near the airport) so if a is airport d is disney and tc is town center, it is like this:a....d....................................tcThere are lots of Chinese mainlanders   I think these are the main source of revenue for the park   so prepare to be shocked by the cultural difference: constant queue barging, invasion of personal space when they are forced to queue (they will probably be sniffing the back of your head or rubbing against your backside)   as if this shorten the queue time, people smoking outside designated areas, ill mannered kids screaming, littering and running around AND on your lucky day you might see the Disney parade as well as the golden showers or golden poop parades performed by Chinese kids.The goods: Buzz lightyear, Lion King show.Tips: Go on weekdays. Avoid queueing with rude looking park guests (the Chinese mainlanders). Get fastpass. The park is REALLY small so if you see a sudden long queue at an attraction, just come back later. It'll save you a lot of time.","Negative"
"We visited here 6 years ago and the only thing that appears to have changed is.....they've not touched it since.The lack of investment is deafening.The Disney Dreams show at 11pm is excellent and the Disney Magic Parade still gets kids grinning from ear to ear. Our 11 year old can't remember anything about the trip we made all those years ago and it's just as well.Captain Eo   closedThe Steamboat   closedThe place adjacent to the Steamboat   closedThe food charges are criminal and the standards even worse. Take a close look and you'll spot flaking paintwork and shabby trim all over the place.The kids love it though and that's all good, but this isn't going to last forever and Disney need to act now if this park is to even begin to keep pace with their others. Instead of opening up new parks around the world, why not give Europe what it deserves and put some proper investment into this place?Oh and could you also please make an effort to advise those atrocious parents who smoke cigarettes in queues alongside children that this is entirely unacceptable? We saw no attempt to do so despite several Disney crew members obviously noticing people doing it. It'd also be nice if there was better access to the Disney characters. An hour to see Mickey Mouse, 50 minutes to see Minnie and 45 to see Winnie the Pooh and Eeyore. It isn't the times as such, but the fact that compared to 6 years ago there was a very noticeable lack of characters. We were there 4 days in total and struggled to see many more (and that was a major disappointment to our child).  374 for 4 days access for the price of 3. At least give us some improvements for the extra cost.","Negative"

"I love amusement parks but hated Disneyland.It looks like the corporate greed at Disney is at its peak. We went during low season in October and it was still crowded and packed with lines averaging between 30 60 minutes per ride.Everything is overly priced, so the overall feeling is not  we want to make your kids happy , but rather  We want your money, and all of it .If you're willing to pay $100 per ticket and wait 45 minutes for a 30 60 second ride, by all means, go ahead   I will never make that mistake again.They are obviously filling the park up to it's legal limit where you feel like you are in a herd so they can maximize their profit.Highlights:  Wait in 15 minutes of traffic to pay for parking.   Pay $18 for parking followed by 15 minutes traffic to enter parking lot.  Walk 10 15 minutes more to the tram that leads to the entrance.  Wait on line for the tram 10 more minutes.  Drive another 5 minutes on a tram to the entrance.   Wait another 5 minutes on line to pass security  After passing security, even with e ticket, wait another 5 10 minutes on line to get into the park.  Once entered, squeeze between the herd of people.  Wait on 40 60 minutes lines during low season.   After leaving the park, spend another 25 30 minutes to get to the car.If Disney were to pay me $100, I would not go there again.If you have small children, you are better off paying $18 and going to Adventure Land, with lines ranging from no wait time at all to about 5 10 minute waits.","Negative"
"Had a great day at Disneyland with the family. We prepurchased tickets at the hotel and took the train with our Octopus card. Very easy using the train system and the quickest way to get there. Go on a weekday to avoid long lines. Food there very expensive. Seemed a little smaller than the US parks, less shows, but the rides are great fun. Toy Story land lots of fun for all.A lot of the eating places were not open when we were there which restricted choices for food.","Positive"
"Disneyland used to be  the happiest place on Earth,  but after having been a resident in Southern California my entire life and owning an annual passport to Disneyland for several years, I have seen first hand the decline of this once wonderful place to visit. There has always been a distinct difference between Disneyland and other theme parks in the area such as Six Flags Magic Mountain and Knott's Berry Farm. Disneyland has always been, to me, family friendly, a nice crowd of people, clean, homey, etc. In recent years though, the park has become less than satisfactory. The park's popularity and obvious growth of the population over the past 20 years in So Cal has greatly affected the quality of this once wonderful vacation spot. Despite the cost of tickets and annual passes, which have increased immensely, the crowd does not seem to dissipate. The crowd has truly increased with the prices making a visit to Disneyland unbearable, especially on the weekend. Until the park manages the amount of people allowed into the park on a given day, I will not be renewing my Premium Annual passport (now approximately $500 annually) and neither will the rest of my family. I will be writing a letter to Disneyland to suggest that they manage the amount of people allowed into the park at a time. There should be a system in place, perhaps some type of reservation system that allows visitors to call in advance and book their trip. If someone decides to go to Disneyland last minute, they can still call in and book a trip if there are available spots. This system could also mimic the fast pass system currently in place in the theme park. Not only is a trip to Disneyland these days unpleasant, but for a park catering to parents and their children, a family park, the amount of people make the park extremely dangerous. I could only imagine if there were some type of natural disaster in the park, children, elderly and handicapped would all be trampled with the amount of people around. I will be using my pass up until it expires and will probably not be visiting until something changes with this once magical place. I wish everyone could have experienced it the way I did as a child.P.S. The food at Disneyland and in Downtown Disney is awful and definitely not worth the price. The only place that is decent is Catal and Club 33!","Negative"
"Had an amazing weekend at Disney with my husband and two children. The park is immaculate and you can experience the true magic of Disney.","Positive"
"We were VERY disappointed with our trip to Disneyland this time: the new multi day ticket picture taking process that was just launched this winter is leading to unbelievable lines just to get in, tired and rude staff and patrons and a significant reduction of our time in the park (20 40 mins a day   more when we park hopped   lost to lines just to get into the parks). While we appreciate the need to stop people from selling sharing their multi day tickets, the staff at the gates need to find a better, more friendly way to manage the lines and to get people through the process and into the park. We lost a lot of time each day to the confusion and poor people management at the gates. For example, on Saturday, two monorail trains left in the morning empty as the staff at the Downtown Disney Monorail gates were unable to process tickets, take photos and answer the multitude of questions raised. The line just stopped moving. I have never experienced anything like it at a Disney Park and we go multiple times each year.We hope that they fix this quickly.","Negative"
"We really like Disney...but, during our visit (Jan 4, 5, 6) the major rides shut down every day...Space Mountain, Matterhorn, Indiana Jones, Thunder Mountain and others...so, how is it that we pay a premium to go to Disneyland to receive bad service...My advice is to avoid Disney until they figure out how to maintain their rides.","Neutral"
"Here I am in my 60's and this was my first visit to Disney. The experience was good and bad. It had a vibe which was really great. The lines and wait times were awful   not a good vibe   I was wondering why people were putting up with it.Some of the rides were great   I always enjoy the 3d experience. Some of the shows were dated   more nostalgia than not   Tiki Birds.I can't help to wonder why Disney doesn't have entertainers for lines which stretch for over 20 minutes, let alone for over 60 minutes! The entire idea of  Fast Pass  should be scrapped! Peope should and must complain.","Neutral"
"Love it, love it, love it. The ticket collectors are glad to see you, the park staff, the ride attendants, everyone is so happy you are there. The park is clean and so well set out. To see Fantasy Castle from the top of Main Street is just the best. The rides are brilliant and each park is an adventure in itself. Don   t miss anything. Go and see all the little shows, do all the rides for the little ones and the adults. Everyone of them is an experience. Make sure you have a turkey leg ( which is really ham), a frozen lemonade and then an ice cream. The candied apples and rice crispy are just amazing and all made with great care and attention to detail. Try and watch the street parades they are great. The Fantasmic show is on Saturday nights and should not be missed if you can. You need to get a fast past near the paddle steamer so you can watch the show. The earlier you get it the better spot you have to watch the show from. The fire works are just amazing. It   s a long day from 8.00 to 12.00pm but it   s worth every minute.","Positive"
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at our Disney hotel recently. There were so many things for the children to enjoy and they had a great time together on the rides and attractions. Some we went back to a few times as they enjoyed them so much. Great park for all ages, so much to see. The fireworks display and water jets with lasers were amazing and a daily treat for all ages. Excellent entertainment. Unmissable.The daily parade was popular a a crowd gathered ready for the floats and characters to parade along the main roads.Highly recommended along with a stay in the Disney hotel, the package deals mean that very little has to be bought on the park in the prices eateries. Vouchers are given by hotels for an afternoon snack and drink in the park.","Positive"
"Since we were already in California we decided to visit Disneyland. Having been to Disney World multiple times, it left us somewhat disappointed. While smaller than Disney World, there were many attractions that were being refurbished or out of service for one reason or another. We still did enjoy our trip because it was Disney, but we didn't feel the magic and excitement we had hoped for. All in all, we thought $95.00 for a 1 day pass was not worth it.","Neutral"
"Ive gotten the season pass every year, and every year it gets more expensive, food is average and overpriced. Parking is $15. Annual passes are exsagerated overpriced, they offer no real discounts for tickets or annual passes when every year they go up. Ive get the no block out date pass and see so many familys get denied admission because its a black out day that day. And you still have to pay for admission to special event like mickeys Halloween party...seriously. And get ready for over crowde. Line. Its just feels like it all about money there now. I really dont think if WaltvDisney was alive it would be so corporate. This year i bought my family the los angeles zoo annual pass $100., knotts berry farm passe for 1kid 2 adults $260., and universal studios annual passes by a day get a year 1 kid 2 adults $260. Guess what its still less than 1 deluxe pass at disneyland for $669.00","Neutral"
"Loved everything about it, it was truly fantastic. We went at the beginning of the school holidays which was the only downside, most lines were hours long.","Positive"
"Since we were staying in Gare de Lyon it was very convenient to get there, taking about 30 minutes to get to the park. Considering you are getting off in Disneyland, the station was a mess. The bins were overflowing with rubbish and we weren't feeling the Disney spirit at that point. Get tickets in advance, they're usually cheaper and the ticket booth is not well signposted outside the entrance.On entry to the main park it was very well laid out, you walk through the village to start and signposts point you in the general direction of specific themes. They have parades with all the characters on at certain times of the day which were fun to watch, but there weren't any characters wandering around. We were expecting to bump into Mickey, Minnie, Donald and the rest of the crew but alas no. In fact the only characters brave enough to walk the streets seemed to be Tweedle dee and Tweedle dum and they were having a smoke break behind the toilets.The place was very crowded. People shoving their way through the crowds and trying to remove Disney items from the clutches of their needy kids.*Tip   Disney is in the business of making money thus merchandising is everywhere! Accept this, if you have a problem with it, don't go or learn how to say no to your kids : ) It's character building.We tried to see everything and go on a few rides. The queues were long for all the rides so waiting is the name of the game. One of the good ones was the haunted house, although people talking loudly throughout the narration was a little annoying.*Tip   If the ride says  Not Acceptable For Children  there's probably a reason. Judging by the number of children crying and looking shell shocked at the end, it would appear Disney don't post the warnings for kicks and giggles. Added entertainment though on exit.For smokers, Disney are kind enough to provide smoking areas for the stressed. Oddly you do still get people glaring at you with theatrical coughing while you enjoy your small dose of nicotine regardless of being in the approved zones. It's little wonder why people end up smoking anywhere.Food was what you would expect from a theme park, we had lunch in the Ali Baba section which was very pleasant and good value since it was unlimited.We read a lot of reviews about the Tea Cup ride. The queue was long and the ride was short. People had actually timed the ride and complained about adults without children enjoying the experience. We rode it anyway. Our ride was approximately 33 seconds long, which actually was the longest we had timed while we were queuing and also the longest we had read about on TA. And no, we didn't agree little Tarquin deserved to jump the queue.We had a great day, all of the things we saw just added to the enjoyment of the day. Don't expect a full Disney experience except for the merchandising.","Neutral"
"Everything here is just amazing. Take your own lunch to save time and money. Would definitely recommend purchasing a fast track ticket and using your entry tickets for free fast track too. Best 10 minutes was meeting Darts Vader. Excellent experience. 4d cinema good fun too. Rides are so exciting. So many you'd need a few days there to do them all. Great for all the family. The 10pm fireworks show extravaganza is an absolute must. Get there around 90 mins before for the best view. Handy popcorn stall in the area to keep you all awake! Best ride in big thunder mountain. I did do starwars hyperspace mountain but it made me feel sick for 4 hours afterwards. Our 8 year old absolutely loved it though. Between 9pm and 10pm the queues for the rides in discovery land were under 20 mins. Did startours (3d simulator) twice in a row. Expect to pay alot for food and snacks and merchandise, however the veggie burger was the best ever one I've had, so looked forward to that on our second day. Can't wait until we go away. Always believe in the Disney magic x","Positive"
"I am a huge Disney fan Huge! We have had annual passports for all of the parks at one stage or another   often for years. Paris always disappoints us  we only go every few years (after we have forgotten how sad it is!). The rides are good  brilliant even. The environment is as you would expect, although a little run down and lacking in the magic again! But it is one simple fact that destroys it   it is without the soul of the other parks. There is no happiness in the staff. There are few smiles and no one wishes you a good day. The people on the gate frown at you or ignore you when you enter. I speak a good amount of French and I asked if I needed a stamp to re enter (At the gate where the stamps were supposed to be given out!) and they ignored me. The staff in the merchandise shops hardly spoke. Another thing I find amazing is that the food is so average   It's Paris for goodness sake. I don't want to eat doughnuts that look half stale. They don't bother to hide works when they are redoing something. There are no picture covered hoardings here   just brown material. So, if you are visiting Paris Disney and you haven't been to Tokyo, Hong Kong or the American Parks and you wonder what the fuss is about, please please please don't take this park as being indicative of the magic you will find elsewhere   a magic that is most often created by the enthusiastic and helpful staff you will meet in the other parks, who often love (and are as fanatical about) Disney as much as I do!","Negative"
"You can't not love Disneyland. I do wish the would get a couple bigger rides for teenagers but I think space is limited.","Positive"
"Indiana Jones, It's a Small World, and others were closed   I was really upset   I wanted to show my kids It's a Small World... The Carousel had spider webs all over it and had not been cleaned or painted it's Horrible!!!Mr. Toad's Wild Ride Broke   problem solved 45 minutes later!Also Pirates of the Caribean broke   while we were on it. For over an hour and we were not allowed to get off  NO REFUND   WHAT A RIP OFF   Total lack of respect for the customers and the dollars we bring. I am NEVER going to DISNEY AGAIN.Almost half our day was waiting to get off the rides. Totally fed up. WORST AMUSEMENT PARK in the WORLD!!! With the Billions of Dollars Disney makes, you think someone could pay for maintenance and fixing rides while the park is closed   NOT DURING THE DAY with passengers on the ride   AVOID at all costs and go elsewhere!!!","Negative"
"I've been to Disneyland (and California Adventure) a number of times over the years, mostly with my kids. If I'd rated them, I'd have given all prior visits a 5. I really do fall for that  happiest place on earth  motto. This latest trip (4 1 2 days with kids and their friends) was peculiar. By the end of our trip, we were up to 10 fails on attractions. And by fail, I mean standing in line for a half hour or more and then having the attraction closed due to problems. 10 times! That's a lot of disappointment for over $300 per person worth of tickets. And experiencing so many ride closures made me realize that Disney is not very good about handling them. No good announcements that can be heard by everyone in line. No easy way to exit lines when things close. Very poor management of Fast Pass vs regular folks when ride throughput dropped precipitously. Having marveled at how good Disney is with people flow, I was quite taken aback by how badly it broke down when things went awry. But 3 is harsh. I love the parks during the holidays   the festive decorations add a magical touch. And I'll no doubt return in spite of this experience. But Disney needs to improve the reliability of their attractions and figure out how to better handle the crowds when things break down.","Neutral"

"If this review saves anyone the overwhelming sense of disappointment, frustration and anger that we have recently endured during our trip (6 to 8 July), then at least something positive may be said of our recent visit to Disneyland Paris. Our party comprised 2 adults and 2 children (6 and 3), and lasted 2 nights, 3 days. It started positively enough with good value for money parking at the local NCP car park and easy access to the train station. Passport control was efficient and embarkation stress free. We then arrived at DLP. Our bags were left at the station and were available for collection at the hotel, so far, so good. Upon arrival at the Station, we were herded into the main shopping and restaurant area. We wandered up and down the main street looking for signs for the main parks,or someone to ask. The one employee we did find, claimed not to know where the main park was...helpful. To be fair, it wasn't that difficult to find, and entry into the main attractions was hassle free (but only with Pre booked tickets, which fortunately we had). Once inside, the enormity of our mistake in coming here began to sink   it was packed,and I mean really,really packed. Many people may be afraid to tell themselves, and their friends, that they did not enjoy their visit because of its cost, and because of the build up to something which for many may be a once in a lifetime experience. But, I can tell you, our immediate observation was that the park was filled with stressed and angry looking parents, and children in melt down: and the ratio of positive to negative comments on this and other sites is not reflective of the sense which we got of the experience people were having. So, we wandered up the main street of the main park, and there were more shops selling the same merchandise available in the shops in the area into which we disembarked   always good to have a second chance in life. Then, some restaurants, then, some more shops. At last we arrived at the entrance of the big castle, and to be fair, it was pretty impressive (especially if you are 3 and 6). A good photo opportunity taken. We moved into the area of the main attractions. I'll spare you a blow by blow account of each ride but suffice it to say, the ride to queue ratio was about 30 minutes queue to 1 minute ride. Most rides lasted for about two minutes, and we did not not queue for anything for less than 55 minutes. Do not trust the queue ready reckoners   they bear no resemblance to reality, and it was not often that this was a point in one's favour. At the merest hint of humidity, most of the rides shut down creating tremendous pressure on those which remained open, and the few play areas were particularly sensitive to the weather. I appreciate the good h&s reasons why this was necessary. The queues, and their length, were a particular problem for those attractions such as meeting the princesses where by the time one actually got to meet the princess (two on shift at any one time, and you're told who you'll see) the children were in a state of total boredom, frequently in tears, and not prepared to talk to anyone   and to be clear, this was not just (one of) my children but around 75% of the queue population   some of these will have been your friends who will have told some of you what a fantastic experience the whole thing was. The child in front of us refused to meet the princess because he was so bored, and one of ours was totally dis interested by the time the big moment came. To be fair to the character, she was very good, and one of my children loved the fleeting moment. But: in, hello, photo, out. Only time will tell if the 75 minutes queue was worth the wait , I hope my daughter remembers the event with fondness. With the exception of a fleeting, long distance glimpse of the disney princesses during one of the parades (which were fun, it has to be said) that was the sum total of access to those characters   access to them was very, very tightly protected. Indeed,the following day, we saw them make a sprint from the location of the meet and greet, to wherever was their destination   not quite ignoring the crowds but clearly uncomfortable about being seen in the open. Once or twice a day, one of the cartoon characters would make an appearance for 5 or 10 minutes, and so starved was the population of access to their favourite characters whom they had travelled to see and meet, that they were very quickly swamped by the crowd,including by adults with no thought for others. It is hard to explain,and the anger is subsiding as the memory fades, but the way the queues were engineered in itself gave rise to stress and tension. Somehow, the designers had managed to insinuate that the end of the queue was nigh, and just as we thought we were near the queue's end, we would perhaps take a corner which revealed several hundreds of previously unseen queuers, or into another room where the real queuing was about to begin. You will know what I mean if, when balancing the positive and negative reviews, you decide that only by itching yourself the Disney scratch will you be able sleep easily again at night! Toilets. Some reviewers have said that the toilets were disgusting. We did not find this to be the case but what I would say is that they were not in abundance, and neither were they very well signposted (nor was anything, for that matter). For many, this will not be a problem but for those with children between, say, 2 and 4,there is sometimes an urgency associated with these matters which is best served with immediate, or near immediate, access to such a facility! Food. The following sentence is one which I thought I would never write, nor even give consideration to writing. By far and away ......(forgive me, my fingers are struggling to input the necessary letters) Macdonalds was the best value for money (with a caveat) but more importantly by the point at which we took the decision (after a family crisis conference) wholesome and tasty meal we ate. For supper on the first day, we visited a pizza pasta place where we queued to order and pay and then queued to collect the food. I'm not sure how the chef managed to create this thing which was called a pizza but it seemed, somehow, watered down   it was devoid of taste, of constituency, of heat, of any sense of enjoyment or even simply physical fulfilment (and I know that may sound particularly ungrateful and immaterial in comparison to the plight of some, as may the rest of this review, but I would ask that it be read in context). I don't believe that water actually escaped from it when it was punctured with my knife and fork, though it may have been, but I would not have been surprised had it been. I've always thought it to be pretty impossible to get pizzas or beef burgers that wrong and so the next day (and I do feel guily about this) we had lunch at a burger bar. Again, we queued for about 30 minutes (at peak time,to be fair) and having been served then discovered that the ability of the restaurant to serve customers far exceeded its ability to seat them. We sat and ate our tepid filler on the floor outside the outlet. The food in the 'meet the Disney characters' place was the probably the worst and must have derived from the universal beast   fish indistinguishable from chicken, chicken from beef. Indistinguishable that is except in the hostility with which it was served, and the (cold) temperature at which it was served. All that said, the   30 odd per head did provide the best 30 minutes the children had across the 3 days with a good selection of cartoon characters enthusiastically visiting each table and so in that respect did provide some sort of value. Shows. The shows were good, and if I had my time again with the experience of the past 3 days, I would make more use of these opportunities. Though the queues were often excruciating one at least got 10 15 minutes of 'payback' (most shows advertised duration of 20 minutes) but at least 5 minutes of that time was spent telling the audience not to take pictures, film or do anything which may in any way infringe copyright (didn't seem so worried about telling it where fire doors etc were located). What, you may ask, did I expect? Well, I didn't expect my wife to cry in pure frustration at the overwhelmingly disappointing experience (she is a wonderfully pragmatic person and always seeks out the sitive in any given situation person) and I didn't expect the 3 year old constantly to ask to go home. I recognise that I am lucky to have been able to have experienced this, and some may say 'I would love the opportunity to queue for 90 minutes with my chidlren'. If you are lucky enough to be able to save hard to afford a holiday this year, then my strongest advice would be not to go to DLP. Long and rambling, for which apologies, but I hope this helps. The sequoia hotel was fine, by the way.","Negative"
"Besides dealing with the line jumpers or cutters, just walking through the park is difficult without getting hit. People will just ram into you like you aren't even there. This park like many others like it, bring out the absolute worst in people. We were waiting in line for Pirates for about 45 min and when we started to turn the corner a family of five lead by the father cut in front of me and my family, I reported this to a worker but she just said sorry. Its not worth fighting over but it sure got my blood pressure to rise. We will never go back to Disneyland, it is far from the happiest place on earth. The walkways are to narrow for the amount of people. This was not much of a vacation it felt like we were going into battle everyday.","Negative"
"I was so excited to be going to Disneyland on our recent family holiday to Paris   I had looked at all the rides with my kids and knew the ones we really wanted to go on ...however   upon arrival there was a strike by the cleaners and there was rubbish everywhere   not a great first impression on what is supposed to be a magical place...walking down the streets inside Disneyland was amazing it was like a dream the rides all looked fun but that dream came to a quick end when we saw the huge lines   the fast pass for big thunder mountain had a 4 hour waiting time which we waited for   but unfortunately the ride was closed for the time that we had been allocated   actually quite a few of the rides had problems with them on the day we went...We decided to wait in line for a ride with the kids which took 45 mins and then it kept stopping ..Given how much it cost us for entry and transport and food I am really disappointed and would not recommend this place unless you like spending 80% of your time in queues.","Neutral"
"Staying at the Anaheim Majestic Garden Hotel meant we were only a couple of minutes by shuttle away from the park gates. What a magical place for our family of four. We really enjoyed this park far greater than the Adventure Land. It seemed to have a much nicer atmosphere, a far better variety of rides and attractions and some superb shops. The parade and fireworks were fantastic and all of the staff very helpful and professional, especially the litter pickers. Some must do rides are Matterhorn Bobsleds, Indiana Jones and The Pirates of the Caribbean. Star Tours was also great but so too was almost everything. Very clean, great security and a fabulous couple of days. The magic of 'Old Watt' lives on. A definite return for us in the future.","Positive"
"I love Disneyland, always have, even into my adult years. This Disneyland trip was rough    You'll want to read these details, and I hope Disney does too. We enjoyed our trip because our attitudes were right, but Disney tried everyone's patience (and I mean everyone in the park).We went as a family of 6, for my nephews 3rd birthday and his first Disneyland experience (along with his mothers first time). We are from Seattle, so we have no qualms with rain, but we will avoid Disneyland if it supposed to rain. Why? Because the rides don't work! Or at least that seemed to be the number 1 excuse from the employees.Friday, May 15th: rained until maybe 2pm or so, that's fine, people had their ponchos and the lines were short :), but unfortunately every ride we tried to ride was shutting down for various reasons. At first it was Space Mountain (when we asked when it would be up and running again, they said 'don't know, but it breaks down at least 3 times a day'   huh? That is never reassuring. Then over to Autopoia   nope, not open due to the rain (will open when it stops). Submarine ride   actually working and was a lot of fun for our group. The little ones loved it, Nemo was a great addition, and the staff were decent. Little Teacups, Storybook Land  shut down due to rain. Matterhorn and Peter Pan closed the whole trip for upgrades. Stood in line at Mad Hatter, sorry folks, the ride has temporarily shut down. Waited another 15 minutes, line moved, great. Oh, ride broke down again   everyone in line must exit. That really was the theme this weekend, even after the rain cleared up and we went into Disneyland again on Saturday, all the rides we went on kept breaking down. I've never been to Disneyland before, or any theme park for that matter, where the rides have broken down so frequently. Even the 4pm Parade on Friday was stopped after 1 float for some technical issue, so was delayed for a bit. The employees kept giving the excuse of 'rain', but when your ride doesn't have tracks that go outside AND the rain has stopped, I think there needs to be a better response to the paying customer. Walking through the park, I remember one family with 2 small kids. The parents were looking for an open ride, as were we and their little girl, maybe 4 years old, starting to whine    'Mommy, Daddy, why does every ride have to be broken?'. Disney, that should tell you something about your audience    we are observant and we are noticing some major issues with your staff and your maintenance of the rides. Haunted mansion broke down 2x while we were on it, then other members of our group tried it again the next day   waited 45 minutes to get to the front to then have everyone in line turned away because it had broke down again. Wow. Splash mountain, 65 minute wait in line, it broke down. Space Mountain, started our 100 minute wait to get to the front of the line and have it break down. A guy in line asked an employee if they knew how long it would be down, the employees reply? 'Two hours'    Then, my husband and I watched that employee turn around and start laughing to another employee. That '2 hour' response rippled down the line of waiting customers and actually made people start turning away. My husband was about the walk out when I said let's wait for the loud speaker announcement. Glad we did, because the ride was running in 10 minutes. Is this the norm now? It wasn't just him though, the employees throughout were noticeably rude, sarcastic, barely smiled (we actually tried telling a joke to the cashier at the Gibson's Ice cream Parlor    fantastic by the way    just to get a small smile out of him), and gave off an attitude like every guest there was an annoyance. Everyone was very routine  this was their job and they couldn't wait for their shift to end. We have been to Disneyland as adults (so we weren't noticing these differences just because we are seeing Disney in a 'grown up' light, and, it wasn't just us that were pointing it out). Maybe we just just went on an off weekend, because my cousin went a few weeks ago and had no issues with rides or employees.While in line for Splash Mountain, the group behind us started commenting on how condescending the guy at the front entrance was when asked about a 'Flash Pass'. They had their terminology wrong and the employee made sure they knew they were wrong. I overheard and told them we had a similar experience with a lady employee working at the Haunted Mansion. She was ushering people through the line with a scowl, rolling her eyes and saying, 'Come on people, keep it moving. Come on, hurry up, we aren't going to bite', with a huge, dramatic sigh that let everyone know she was irritated. When did the employee's at Disney become so miserable? Actually, we met a couple of employees (who weren't in character) who really stood for what Disney is all about. One young lady who was all smiles, eager to help with directions and even walked us to where we needed to go. Another girl near the French Quarters, again very helpful, approachable, and happy to help with our questions. Thank you to Mickey for being so awesome to our 3 year old nephew . You absolutely made his day and ours too!In the end, although it took more time and patience than usual, we were able to ride the rides we desired most and got to see our little nephews face light up over and over. The warm and fuzzy's may not have been there for us this trip, but our focus was him. My family will still enjoy Disneyland for years to come, but I think Disney needs to go back to some of Waltz' basics     be happy! Maybe less advertisements on TV and more money towards the maintenance of the rides and or your employees (we know who you are Disney, and we expect the rides to work when we pay out the nose to visit your park). Again, we love Disney, and we enjoyed ourselves because we wanted to have a great memory for our little one, but there is no acceptable excuse for the lack of customer service and constant broken rides that we all dealt with this last weekend. The 60th Anniversary for Disney is next week and I hope management is reevaluating how they are operating the happiest place on Earth.","Neutral"
"I have now been to Disneyland Paris three times (well, actually the first time it was still Euro Disney). The first time was OK   despite it still being built. The second time (three years ago) there was a strike on so no parades and hardly any characters. Disneyland Studios at the time was sad and gave the impression that it was closing down and the food was terrible. We stayed at the Sequoia Lodge which, at the time, was actually very nice. Strange how things can change in three years. We returned in April this year due to a massive family get together (so Disney would not have been my choice). What a huge disappointment. Lets start with the Sequoia were we stayed. Clean, but poor service throughout. The bath towels were the size of hand towels, one soap between the three of us sharing the room for the duration, the plug in the sink didn't work (i.e. you had to use a nail file to prise it out) and only half the lights in the room worked. I have since found out from friends associates who have also stayed at the Sequoia that they all experienced this as well      we can   t have all stayed in the same room!The main park at Disney, shows signs of being run down. The trams seem to have disappeared, as have the old cars. The toilets were dirty and the parades were, how can I put this, pathetic. If you want to see a decent parade go to Bridgwater Carnival in Somerset!The Studios fared slightly better in as much as it looks like it   s had a lick of paint, since our last visit. However, again, it is almost as if they are trying to save money big time. This was particularly obvious in Honey I shrunk the Kids. It was so worn that the film was fuzzy and half the audience couldn   t feel the mice. We had to explain to those of our party that had never been before what was supposed to happen. Disney Village, like the parks, seemed very sad. Sad staff, sad service, and (like the hotel) half the lights in the signs didn   t work. Very seedy.So, would I recommend Disneyland Paris? If you have children and have never been to Florida     yes. They will be happy as it   s Disney. If you are going with other adults     no. It   s a massive rip off. Over priced, shabby and tacky. Even the fast food     isn   t (expect to wait up to 20 minutes for a burger    and that   s AFTER they   ve taken your order!","Negative"
"Went there to spend all day but after many hours we rallies that it's not what we expect .. it's a great magical land for kids they will live there dreams there but l don't recommend it for adults !!","Neutral"
"Smaller than other Disney Parks but a welcome and fun place to visit for everyone. Good ticket prices, discounts for seniors, less expensive than other Disney Parks; great offers for family visits to the park and resort. THE DISNEY TRAIN IS A MUST   has Mickey shaped windows, character statues in niches on train and just wait until you see the Train station at the resort","Positive"
"I've been really struggling on how to write this review. We went to Disneyland on December 21st, 2014. I've personally been to Disneyland over 6 times since I've been a child. So I knew what to expect. This time around we went with my brother and his family. So in total we had 4 adults and 4 kids under 6. We arrived right at 8AM and spent 12 hours in the park. In the morning the rides were great. We hit Star Tours and the rest of tomorrow land right away. Minimal lines. By the time lunch hour rolled around it was 90 minutes for Thunder Mountain and over 190 minutes for Pirates of the Caribbean. At least we were able to fast pass the Haunted Mansion.We ate at two of the restaurants on site (see my other reviews).Overall the reason that I didn't mark it higher is this:Photopass:We purchased a photopass. We were expecting it to be like the Disney Cruise Ships where there were photographers everywhere. We didn't encounter our first photographer until 7pm. We went to complain but they said we have set locations (which they didn't tell us where they were) and that there was a no money back policy. To me this is a scam. Stay away from the photographers. If you spot a location then just take your own shot there. They just have a  set  spot to take a picture from.Number of People:The park was packed. Period. At times it was a disaster getting around in New Orleans. They put way more people into the park then I remember the last time we went at Christmas. IF you are going to have a 100  minute wait for rides you should implement the fast pass on them. Period.Unhappy Park Employees:For the first time every I encountered park employees complaining about things to each other. I was waiting for the ladies to use the bathroom (yes there was a line for that also) when I watched two park employees complaining to each other as they walked from one location to a behind scenes location. I've never encountered this before here ever. If the employees are not happy what about us?I also had to get to my reservation for supper at the main street cafe during the electric light parade. An employee actually started to yell at me as I tried to get into the restaurant. He was saying I couldn't go there due to the parade. When I explained to him that I'd be charged $90 bucks for missing my reservation time and that I'd expect compensation he let me through. Measles.So the other thing that irks me is the entire measles outbreak that has occurred. Apparently we were at Disney a day after the outbreak occurred. So there was no warning about it. However, they packed us all like sardines into the park so odds are we were all exposed. Thank goodness we vaccinate and all of us are ok.In conclusion go during an off time. Don't go during the peak holidays as the place is a gong show.","Neutral"
"Visited last year whilst camping nearby. We have 2 little girls who are obsessed with everything Disney so bought the tickets as a surprise. We were definitely not disappointed! The main entrance is fabulous, and the whole park is extremely well designed. The characters walking around are brilliant. Most rides are great but as the day wore on the queues got pretty big. Very expensive for food and in the gift shops but this was expected (who goes to Disneyland expecting a cheap day out??) Quite hard to get an autograph & we only managed 2   Mickey Mouse who we had to queue up for over an hour to meet (but they did have cartoons on a big screen inside an old fashioned theatre whilst you waited) and Aurora (be warned   you have to queue at a specific time to get a ticket for the princesses   we sent Dad while we went on a ride   then return at another specified time to queue again for approx. 15 mins to meet one of two princesses). However it was worth every second of queuing just to see my daughters' faces when they met them both!The girls have asked for the past 6 months when we are going back, and we definitely intend to return many times before they grow too old to enjoy it!","Positive"
"We came on a rainy season and it was raining on the day we planned to be here. If there's a hint of rain   be prepared for your raincoats or there are available for sale at the park HK$35 kids; HK$45 adults. Do not miss Space Mountain ,RC Racer all rides in Toy Story Land was a great hit for my kids.FOr Birthday celebrants get your badges at the City Hall : )","Positive"
"I took the crew to Disneyland for the day (with grand kids). It was Dapper day,nice but king of strange?? a lot of people in a small place. The rides were nice lines were not real long. The castle a bit disappointing. We are regulars at the Disneyworld parks. This park is no where near the experience the World has to offer. The park was clean but was very crowed. The Haunted Mansion still had the Halloween display which was really cool. The food was about the same as others rides are cool as is in the other parks. I went to get a handicap access pass as I do at the other parks. (The new system gives you a time to come back as if you are in line.) It all stated out bad I had to argue with the attendant to prove I needed a pass an was asked what medical condition I have because I am no in a wheel chair. (I am a disabled vet with back  standing issues after a few surgeries) I am not really sure why I was put through this. After getting the pass added to my card it was worthless to use for any ride but one time. No one at the ride understood was the pass was for and I had to pass on a lot of the rides because I can not stand in one place for very long. This is enough for me to never return to this park ever again. I have family in this area which means this is a big disappointment for me. This needs to be addressed. I can understand this cause issues with some that think people are just trying to get over and get in line faster which is not in my case. The park is cool just some things did not work for me. Customer service needs work.","Negative"
"Frankly speaking this was my first time to Disneyland and it was an enjoyable one at that. The rides were great, not very scary as Disneyland is supposed to be a land for the kids. Spend an entire day there with my friends, riding most rides. It was a reminisce of my childhood days with the Disney characters around. I would definitely bring my children here one day in the future.","Positive"

"We were in Disneyworld in April, since we loved it so much decided to go to Disneyland in January. Traveled with hubby, 4 year old and 2 year old. My 2 year old enjoyed it much more this time around. my daughter (4 year old) loved it so much, especially the princesses.I liked Disneyland for the fact that it is smaller than Disneyworld, less walking, less busy as well. What i didnt like about it is that they had so many time restrictions, like they dont have fireworks everynight, instead they had it only on the weekends and one of the nights they had to cancel it due to the wind. Also, they only have a parade at night during the weekdays. In addition the hours of the park are much less than disneyworld, they are only open from 10am to 8pm during the weekdays while on the weekend they are open from 7am to 12am, i remember in disneyworld they were open longer than that.Also my daughter didnt get to see all the princesses this time because the only photo taking they have is with 3 princesses at a time and its up to luck to see which princesses are there at that time, if you're in line waiting for a particular princesses, she might leave by the time you get to the front of the line. Overall, we had a great time, love disney but honestly I think next time we will go back to disneyworld.","Positive"
"Good place to relax for adults and children, will take a whole day to view all the features inside the park.","Positive"
"Easyly reached by MTR, Disneyland HK also famous as one of the place you should visit in HK. I did and sadly to say I'm not so impressed. Disneyland is a guaranteed place to have fun for kids. But, this place can't satisfied every single family member.","Neutral"
"It is truly the most magical place. I got about five to six times a year even though I live over 300 miles away. Clean, polite and happy cast members, a real joy. Prices have gone up alot in the years but I guess so has everything else. Only wish the crowds were smaller...it can get really crowded after noon....","Positive"
"My husband and I visited Disneyland in 1995 and finally returned 18 years later with our girls (15 & 12yrs). Disney now has 2 theme parks, both accessed through the same area. The original Disneyland is called Disneyland Park and the newer Disney California Adventure Park. We had a 3 day pass so we visited Disneyland Park on the first day, Adventure Park 2 days later and then both parks the following day. There were the expected queues, but we didn't wait any longer than 1 2 hour for any 1 ride. The most popular ride at Adventure Park was Radiator Springs Racers (75mins), but as this wasn't really of interest to us we decided not to wait. Our favourite rides at Adventure Park were Tower of Terror, California Screamin' roller coaster & Sourin' Over California. The Grizzly River Run was fun but be prepared to get wet! It was great that they had Starbucks here also. There was a fairly big range of food and not too expensive considering they have a captive audience. We loved Disneyland Park, it was definitely our favourite out of the 2. Too many favourite rides to list them all but stand outs were Indiana Jones, Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Carribean. The Soundsational Parade which is at the end of the day is really fantastic. We watched it from the corner in Main Street near where the parade finishes. The last day we went was a Friday so we could see the fireworks. It was well worth putting up with the larger crowds to see the night time displays.","Positive"
"We have been here 4 other times but never in the summer. Will never do it again in high season. Like ants in an anthill. You can hardly move. Rides from 60 minutes waiting to 210 minutes! Who waits over 3 hours for a ride? And fastpasses gone by 9 am? Only one fast pass at a time and the return time on them 2 hours! Line ups for everything, food, bathroom, water fountains, everything! I guess I just didn't realize there's no maximum to the number of guests allowed in the park at one time. Seriously if there was a fire, the mass panic and stampede would be deadly. All in all, we enjoyed our time but not nearly like the other four times, the rose colored glasses are off. Try the Plaza Inn for the chicken dinner for $13.99, best deal in the park, and there aren't many deals to be had. Also enjoyed the chicken nuggets and fish sticks at the Stage Door Cafe in Frontireland, the turkey legs, the churros, and of course the pinapple floats at the Tiki hut. If you can handle the crowds, it's a fun place to be. Try the off season and it's much better.","Neutral"
"It's Disneyland! It's so much fun for everyone(teens) !!!! We definitely got our money's worth. The tix prices have gone up but we did not feel ripped off. It was a fabulous day. Middle of August is a great time to visit. We didn't wait long in lines and we were able to go on a few rides multiple times. The fireworks were awesome and the fantasmic show was AMAZING! We are already planning out our route for our next visit : ) can't wait","Positive"
"I don't now how it's ALWAYS so crowded here. Makes me crazy with the crowds. Not only that, but the ticket costs....only to get in and stand in line after line. Then watch people that rent wheelchairs and scooters skip the lines with their 10  member families, so they don't have to wait in lines. That's frustrating and disappointing that Disney doesn't limit that. The staff.... goodness Disney...grumpy staff complaining together constantly is ridiculous.... STAFF....shush and do your complaining AWAY from those of us visiting the  Happiest Place on Earth . I get you're unhappy and disgruntled I just don't want to listen to it over and over in either park. Hate your job?? Then feel free to quit. So go with patience to the parks...the crowds and your budget will appreciate it.","Neutral"

Half term holidays so huge queues taking about 1hr per ride. As Disney before found staff very unfriendly to small kids lost the sparkle of true Disney. Characters hardly walked around anymore. meeting places took hours to have cuddle with them. Strollers prams well become so difficult now. used to offer single or doube stroller.    12    18. Now    20 single only. Then find cant take out park unless    50 deposit given. Then if take from one park you cant leave at another park as cant get deposit back so needs returning to same park. staff unhelpful and whole process useless as babies and young toddlers cant walk between village restaurants and park distance too great and stroller pointless. whom would steel stroller? they are solid and heavy and dont fold. Food and drink become total Mickey take for best words. Now so expensive for poor quality food or drink. vending machine coffee at too hotel price in horrid paper cup not even drinking lids like mac donald's do for    1. Really the park is looking tied. run down and staff need training. Nothing like Disney USA and just feel totally let down for my family and kids disappointed. Oh yer and broken down roller walkways to car parks leaving little kids so far to walk without help. left days with boards up at each end and no effort to fix. Shame on Disney. ","Negative"
"The Christmas feel for the park is great at this time of the year but was very busy on all 3 days with queues that are just too long. It is not worth waiting 2 hours just for one ride. You just don't get your value out of the admission pass. Went in the park at 8am one day but found were only a few rides open although at least got on some at 9am before it got busy. The evening 'fireworks' display very disappointing as is just a light show with projection onto the castle. No where near as good a few years ago. As before the food was expensive and junk","Neutral"
"How could you close so..... many rides at the same time and still charge the same amount? So annoying and frustrating waiting in the long lines of other rides. The Cars Racer ride was very fun, the line was about an hour. We managed a fast pass but when we went the ride was not running. Went back an hour later and waited for approx 30 min with our fast pass! Getting that also a challenge. People go into the ride single line and get on a lot quicker! A method to the madness. Disney is usually lots of fun, yes expensive but well done.Lots of disappointments, Bugs Life replaced temporarily thank goodness for Malifecent! Not the same experience at all. Yes the stroller world is out of control, parents dragging toddlers and babies to Disney in 90 degree weather is ridiculous! There are lots of fun memories to be made in Disneyland. World of Color was amazing! Wow. We booked a dinner was given a pass with it and watched right down in the front. That was the best part of our visit! I agree do your research to make it all happen magically!","Neutral"
"While the long lines at the park are famous, apparently horrible and rude service is a standard at the hotel too.","Negative"
"We visited Disneyland park with 5 kids and it was a pretty disappointing experience. The place was not well organized at all, long queues, dirty toilets, no food and to top it all half the rides were undergoing renovation. Not worth the hype at all","Negative"
"If you've been to Disney in the US, even Anaheim which is considered much smaller than Orlando, you'll be very disappointed. Beside the fact that it almost feels like a knock off of Disney, with smaller versions of rides etc, all the shops are sponsored by brands you can buy at spinneys! You've got kinder and Ben&Jerry's and Hertz... and the whole thing is small, and has a taste of French attitude which kills the American spirit a little bit. Food options are horrible! Again, for those who haven't seen the one in USA, you'll probably not feel what we felt.","Neutral"
"Visited DisneyLand Paris August (on a Monday) together with my wife and our 3 year old daughter. Took the train from Paris to Disneyland, approximately 40 mins, 2 metro tickets cost 14.90 EUR (oneway). Children under 4 travel free.We arrived there around 10.30. I had booked the tickets online (59 EUR each, children under 3 free entrance).Just before entering the park, there is a huge security checkpoint, they check all of the bags. There were only 4 queues lines for the security check so they were quite long. Anyway, after about 10 mins went through to the turnstiles to enter the park. Out of about 15 turnstiles only about 6 was open but it was not a huge line to enter the park. Once inside we rented a stroller, 15 EUR. If you take the rented stroller between the parks, you need to leave a 70 EUR deposit ( credit card or cash) and show the form to the turnstiles when exiting one park.The park had more adults than children. The queues for the attractions and rides was full of adults, not kids. Which made the lines longer and at the expense of families with kids. Although on the website it indicated designated smoking areas, there were adults smoking all over the place. It was disgusting. Not even in Paris did i experience so many smokers in one place. And not a single Disney personel to tell them they cannot smoke in un designated areas. I understand even an adult would want to experience Disneyland, but then get them to pay for it rather than just going to every ride at the expense of children.The Disney Park is mostly just shops, with Disney merchandise. Once you enter these you have to buy something, cause it is rather tempting the way they display them. The attractions are not at all what i imagined they would be. Very poorly maintained. Went through the Wild West area, it was just some empty deserted buildings, with nothing interesting to see. I saw 3 disney people wearing cowboy jackets and a toy pistol sidearm. And they were just walking not doing any sort of act. Boring.The Disney castle is tiny, I always imagined it to be much bigger, the way they advertise it.Not a single parade. Where are all of the disney characters ??? where is the magic ??? The spirit of Disney ? I only saw one disney character, Winnie the pooh, the wait time for the queue to see him was about 30 mins. Didn't wait as it was too long. Not one single other disney character was seen for the almost 3 4 hours we walked about and spent in queues. The queue time for the other attractions was a minimum of 30 mins, going upto at least 1 hour for the train rides. The smallest wait time was for the boat ride which was about 10 mins.Ate 3 hotdogs, just a plain bun with an undercooked sausage, 6.80 EUR each. No mustard sauce, just some ketchup.The walt disney studios is the same. Nothing to see, not at all interesting. All of the queues to the attractions are full of adults, the kids have to wait.Would i go again ? No way, absolute waste of money, waste of time and waste of energy. Don't waste your money on this scam, visit some of the other Paris sites like Asterix Park. And enjoy Disney on TV. The park was supposed to be magical, it brought us down to reality.Was a total disappointment.","Negative"
"Highlights, Space mountain (always amazing) Pirates of the Caribbean (classic), Thunder Mountain (fun), Indiana Jones, Cool   painful, It's a small world (relaxing and classic), Haunted mansion (still magical). Not worth the price you pay. $155 for rides to be closed. Rip off! Not sure how families travel here! So expensive. I would rather go to Mexico for the same prices. Followed this trip up with a visit to Las vegas, and saw more Disney characters there. Breakfast at Goofy's Kitchen was cool. Way overpriced, but at least got to get a photo with the characters and good food. You can skip their photography for $40 and just hand the photographer your phone for photos. Fireworks at the end of the night was cool. I guess I just don't care about the new Disney characters. Just not the same. Good for kids, lame for adults.","Negative"
"We went on a Saturday first thing when park opened and wait times for rides were acceptable. Park got a lot busier after lunch time though.They do a fabulous job with parade at night and fireworks right after that. They even made it snow on us.Employees were very helpful and the ones who worked the rides kept lines moving. We were able to ride every ride we wanted.The only thing that could have made it better would have been employees stationed along the way to prevent groups of teens from cutting in line.","Positive"
"First time going to disneyland, we went on monday but it was fully packed    taking an autopia ride took an hour to queue","Positive"
"I have given this a rating out of three simply because it is so much smaller than Orlando or Los Angeles. Having said this , if this is your first Disney experience or if you are simply a disney addict like I am , than you will have fun. The parade is lovely and it has Space Mountain which my teen daughter loved. It has the Buzz Lightyear ride which is a family favourite , with everyone competing to get the highest score. For you grandparents going with the grandchildren ,it is great when you beat them. I found the Toy Story land disappointing as it is really quite small. The food is average and you certainly only need one day if the crowds are low. It is an easy ride on the MTR from Kowloon . You have to change trains twice, but it is literally walking across to the other side of the platform. The last section you get to go on the Disney train filled with Disney memorabilia.","Neutral"
"Long queues at everything, but with the help of the official app, you can organize your adventure. A lot of very fun things to do for all ages. The parade is awesome especially if you see it from the start point. The shows are also a must. Check the app for all essential details. You need internet for it to work at 100% capacity. The parking lot is huge so it is fairly easy to find a spot.","Positive"
"What a rip off! And the queues   my goodness. 1 hour 40 minutes for a 2 minute ride   just crazy. Distinct lack of characters around this year, very few staff to help and vastly over priced merchandise. Brings out the worst in everyone!","Negative"
"Disneyland speaks for itself! However there are a few things that might make your trip more enjoyable. If you are visiting with small children,stick to one park. If however you can move quickly and want to get on as many attractions get a park hopper. You must use the FASTPASS system. Get one at one park then go over to the other and get another one and go back and forth. You save tons of waiting in line time and get lots of exercise! Even with crowds we were able to go on many attractions with less line waiting! Also pack water frozen water bottles and put them in a locker. For the price on one locker you'll save money on drinks easily. When you need a rest take the railroad around the park a couple of laps. It's very shady and relaxing but pick it up in tomorrow land, the line is much shorter there. Don't forget to savor the trip and enjoy the day with your family!","Positive"
"We have been to Disney Florida & California and loved both of them. We only have memories of happy times.We knew August would be busy at EuroDisney so expected the queues for the rides and that the parks would be very crowded. Nothing prepared us for the amount of pushing, shoving and queue jumping. The restaurant food was terrible and the toilets were stinking.However, we had two really bad moments:The first was buying a Yearly Pass. The queue at the Annual Passport Office took 2 hours, despite the girl saying it would take 20 minutes. They are fanatical about you leaving buggies outside for Health & Safety reasons. They repeatedly asked us to do so, but we refused until we were close to the doors of the Annual Passport Office. When we eventually put the buggy with the others outside, our 2 year old daughter began to scream ...and scream ...and scream. She is in the Terrible Twos after all. We had one French man shouting abuse at us about her screaming. Inside we decided to complain about the long wait. The girl on the desk said   what do you expect, it's August!  We asked to see a manager, but she was another member of staff with an attitude problem. Basically they laughed in our faces. You pay a lot of money for Annual Passes and we expected administration to be fast, it isn't. What a waste of 2 valuable hours in the Parks.2) We came out of the Peter Pan ride late in the evening and decided to join the people gathering for the late night show. What a mistake! It became incredibly crowded in the area by the castle. Eventually there was absolutely no room to move. We were starting to get fairly worried by the pushing and shoving going on. On the one hand EuroDisney go on about not taking buggies into the Annual Passport OIffice for Health & Safety reasons, but people were trying to run us over with their buggies, so that they could get a better view. EuroDisney needs to take a good look at its crowd control, especially when you cannot see much in the dark. We would have liked to leave because we felt so uncomfortable in the crowd, but there was no room to move to exit.The only redeeming feature of the whole 4 days at EuroDisney was the parade at 7.00 pm, which was fantastic. Get your act together EuroDisney:  for the amount of money spent you expect better administration, better attitudes and better crowd control.","Negative"
"This was a surprise for the kids and what a surprise, amazing place takes you back to being a kid yourself, some rides were closed but didnt matter the experience was well worth it, easy to get around and find stuff plenty of things to do and snack options. the shows at the end of a night are worth waiting for aswell","Positive"
"Visited this past weekend and have never left the happiest place on earth so disappointed. If you do not purchase a ticket for the holiday treat you should just not go. Granted it was very hot but when they shut down Disney, the other park gets way to crowded","Negative"
"We booked knowing it was spring break and lines would be long but looked forward to visiting the original Disneyland. We were blown away at how the Disney has been taken out of this park. It   s pretty close to just your average rundown old amusement park. Bus loads and I mean bus loads of unsupervised and disrespectful teenagers run rampant through the park. We spent several hours between groups in lines for the attractions and watched them ignore every sign to    stay off    etc. These signs acted like a dare to them. So here is the other problem. Fast passes and lines. Once you scan your fast pass the line often parallels the regular line. More than once we saw groups jumping a measly road to skip the regular line. Disney needs to put a second check station in to prevent the line jumpers. Only Space Mountain has this second check and you should have see the kids and even adults getting kicked out of the line. Lines for food, lines for bathrooms, lines for rides, lines for the security check (worse than and longer than the airport). Disney staff so rude that I wonder how they got a job (ok I   d be a little mad after dealing with the teenagers I just described) but tried to give them a bad day break. Glad to say we saw the original again but will go to World for the Disney experience. PS: Fastpass everything you can including all the night shows in all the parks. Sometimes it   s still not the best view but better than no view.","Negative"
"We did one day here and had fun. The lion king show was very good  a must see. Everything looks the same as other disneys but was missing (in my opinion) some of the more exciting attractions offered at Disneyland in LA or Disney world. This is why I would say better for younger kids. My kids are 7 and while they had fun noted the LA one was more fun and that they liked ocean park better. 1 day is definately all you need. I would say if you've never been to Disney or have young kids worth doing,but if you are short on time and have access to go to other disney's you may want to skip. I would recommend doing ocean park more in that case.","Neutral"
"Couple things to note right off the bat: Crowds, Fastpass, Photographers. Even if you get there before the park officially opens, you're going to be part of a crowd. Just get used to that. There will be lines everywhere. However, the lines are worth it! (I know that sounds strange.) Disney has tried really hard to put interesting things in the lines to keep you busy while waiting. Enjoy their attention to detail: the painting, displays, information, landscaping, etc while you wait. Absolutely take advantage of their services and technology! Use the fastpass distribution centers. USE THEM! While you wait for 2 or so hours for your fastpass window, ride a couple of the short line wait rides near by, or use that waiting time to watch a performance (something is going on constantly all day in every area of the park) or browse the shops. If you are visiting with kids, absolutely go see the characters. The lines for those are long too, but the look on the kid's faces when they finally meet their heroes is totally worth every minute you spent in line. Be sure to check character times. Some are only around for a couple hours, some are around all day. This information is available as a pamphlet when you first get in. Make use of the photographers Disney has spread out also! They have people stationed at character areas, and photo op spots (like in front of the castle) with nice cameras and a card they store the picture info on. Then the only thing you have to worry about is keeping track of a little plastic card, as opposed to not getting trampled while you set up the shot, or trying to keep track of the pesky camera, or keeping it dry on the water rides. I cannot stress enough: Use their services, it makes the experience less stressful for you! There was a show by the Tom Sawyer island at night, that by itself was worth the cost of admission. I won't ruin it by explaining, just know that the night time shows are a must see.","Positive"
"Whatever age you are, you cannot fail to enjoy the sights of this attraction.Make sure you get a free map on the way in as it is quite easy to get lost. Also, get a free brochure of the time of events as this will inform you when the different characters will be at the respective areas.","Positive"
"Was as expected. Will return but in February when everyone is paying off Christmas. Food and everything to purchase was double the price. Rides continued to breakdown and little to no notice that it was broken.","Neutral"
"We were very pleasantly suprised by Disneyland Paris, it was excellent fun having quite low expectations before arriving. For all the rides and shows the ticket prices represent great value for money. However beware of the food, it is an appalling representation of French cuisine and way overpriced. If you don't want the the onset of early diabetes and be bankrupt before year end take your own food and drinks. The other issue is no policing of smokers, whom seem to light up wherever they please (including queues) with complete disregard for theirs or others health or safety. There are designated smoking areas, but you would never know it.","Positive"
"We went here with my entire family.., my second Disney visit (First one is in Hongkong). This 99 USD attraction is surely great for kids and kids of heart. The only thing that pissed me off is this fast pass. If you wanted to see a live show in the theater, secure a fast pass. Even you're at first in line but you dont have the fast pass, you may still end up standing at the back for they may fill the theater with fast pass holders. Second, for the FANTASMIC (lights fireworks) show at 7:30, secure your fast pass as early as 5:30 or else, you may need to secure a place in the restaurants. (of course you need to order). Fast pass is free but they only limited quantity is being issued.","Neutral"
"Worst amusement park ever.  Huge parking fee (120 for motorbike), same for the entrance fee, and the attractions inside are crappy. Food isnt great but that's not what you're coming there for...  Not a good experience.  Ocean park is much better","Negative"
"Really disappointed with our latest trip here. Last went in Feb and can see a difference in the upkeep and standard of the park. Shabby rides, algae growing on walls of dumbo ride, water by discovery land green and smelly, toilets dirty. Several rides broke down while we were in line including: ratatouille (twice), big thunder mountain and buzz lightyear. Extra magic hours a joke   lack of staff meant that normal day visitors could get in all areas from 9.30 as no one to check once inside park. Many food outlets and restaurants closed despite the ones open being fully booked apart from half nine at night (too late for a toddler)   if they are fully booked then surely enough demand for another one to open? Long queues everywhere including for lunch (35 mins in colonel hathis with one till open), and 20 min queue for breakfast in hotel. The christmas parade had 5 floats and a shorter route than normal parade   less characters too. Complete lack of characters out and about in the park, only scheduled meet and greets with mickey and Minnie, goofy and Donald or a couple of princesses and these had queues of over an hour. None in the hotel. Christmas decorations at entrance and in Main Street impressive and then nothing on the rest if the park. Also, extremely irritating were the large families with one child with 'behavioural' problems which meant they couldn't wait in a queue so they got the whole family a pass which let them use the disabled line and go straight to the front of the rides. This is a scam being used over and over in the parks. The food at the blue lagoon restaurant and the steak house was good, as was the service in both. The disney dreams show was also good.Unfortunately, this isn't a proper disney experience, more a theme park with disney decorations.","Negative"
"I was there for an hour before my iphone got stolen. I was queueing with my two year old who needed help, so I put all my things down on the ground and saw to him, and meanwhile someone came past the queue and stole my iphone, hat and jumper off the ground next to me. Nobody cared. I managed to find city hall, after being redirected four times, and they just wrote my number down on a piece of paper and a description   no help even though there are security guards EVERYWHERE   nobody was interested. I queued for three rides, Mickey mouse (40 minutes queue), the Teacups (25 minutes queue) and the Carousel (20 minutes queue) this was just after 10 in the morning, so we got there as early as it opened. Each ride was really fast   actually so fast I barely managed to take a few photos with my iphone (now stolen) before they ended   maybe 2 minutes maximum? I bought a hotdog at Casey's hotdogs, for 9.50euro (about 8 british pounds) and it was properly disgusting. The sausage was plastic, tough and rubbery, luke warm, and the bread was like plastic, tasteless, yeasty and boring. The  cheese  was nothing I had ever seen that came from an actual cow   more like yellow covered slime, and the crispy onions were saturated in greasy oil. I bought a small cup of popcorn for 5 euro, again, it was greasy, bland, tasteless and actually, I left it on a seat because I couldn't be bothered carrying it on all the queues, where I had to leave my 20 euro hired stroller behind and carry all my things, including my two year old son, through the enormous queues. My son wanted to meet Mickey Mouse, but there was a half an hour queue and I said no. Temper tantrum ensured but I was tired, alone, and in a large place that felt really unfriendly and all about show and making money, not about wonderment. The staff really didn't care. The ticket cost 84 euro for me for the day, it surely wasn't worth that. Many of the rides were shut, and you have to walk for miles around all the construction walls that are up. My recommendation? Hell on earth. Please don't waste your money. Go to Paris, see the Eiffel tower, walk along the river, go to Notre Dame   give your children a brain, not an empty wallet.","Negative"
"Packed even on a rainy friday, many of the attractions are so.... 1990....Jungle Cruise displays a collection of old animatronics as many of the attractions.It is time for Disney to reinvent their parks and create more contemporary experiences.We had fun though at Haunted Mansion and Splash Mountain.The price is also quite high for what it offers (to adults)All attractions accessible to handicapped but less seamless than at Universal.","Neutral"
"JUST FOUND OUT YESTERDAY you're going to ruin Disneyland for a temporary craze? I would have signed that petition months ago if I had known you were going to destroy the back lot and some other attractions to put in Star Wars Land? That doesn't fit with the theme of that part of the park. Hey executives, that was really stupid!","Neutral"
"I'll start by saying we have been to Disney World in FL before with our kids, and left there feeling completely exhausted each day due to the sheer size of the parks themselves, proximity between each park, etc. Disneyland by comparison, is so much easier to manage with kids! Our kids (5 and 8) had no problem walking the entire time throughout Disneyland and California Adventure on the days we were there. It was also nice to see healthy food choices available for purchase within the park too.We had a great time at Disneyland. It wasn't too crowded on the days we were there thankfully, so we never had to wait long for the rides. We especially liked Star Tours, Splash Mountain, Space Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean in Disneyland and over in California Adventure we really liked California Screamin' and Cars Land. Radiator Springs Racers should not be missed   get on line first thing in the morning for that ride!","Positive"
"Today I'm in Disneyland in Anaheim, CA. I'm here to report that two of their most popular attractions are closed due to maintenance issues. The Hunted Manssion and the Thunder Mountain. It is a shame that a park like this is having this kind of issues when summer is kicking of. I can't do anything but wonder when we will hear about a safety incident here. Also feel like I'm owed a refund because no one told us about this until we showed up at entrance. The fact that these attractions were closed caused that the others to be extremely crowded making the park experience completely worthless.","Negative"
"Too experience to visit ,for over $600 Hk , every things so crazy , waiting time for any ride well over one hours ! washroom is closed to one and half hours wait ,poor ladies 1,the foods is so pricey ever Micky would not buy it ,people ,people ,people ! it is a small kingdom with no local want to come ,no wonder they lost money every year ,better off save time and moneys do some things else ,you will thank me for it !","Negative"
"A very disappointing experience.Went with my husband , grandchildren and daughter and her husband for three days.Long queues everywhere, some over an hour for rides which last 5 minutes. We went on 3 rides a day ! Poor signage and lack of information on site. Queues to meet Disney characters , plus charges for photos. All in all there is no Magic, just a money making concern.","Negative"
"We've been a few times in the past 10 years, the place is starting to look desperately run down and out of date.Part of the 'shuttle ride' in the Universal studios park takes you past a set from a film called 'Reign of Fire'.Now, I happen to like that film, but it's not every well known and it was released in 2002....So plenty of confused faces on that ride, hardly anyone knowing what the hell 'Reign of Fire' is was.DESPERATELY needs money spent on it to make it up to date, it's starting to look really, really sad....","Negative"
"So here are the pros:Lots of characters located throughout the parkFun rides Incredible shows Overall atmosphere ConsLong lines Fast pass not what you think (although it does help) Not as many rides for the 11 year old plus compared with other parks Summary : nice place to visit at least once in your life to say you have been there. We really enjoyed the overall atmosphere at Disneyland but the fast pass was not what you think as you can get two to three rides per day. For adults that are pretty chill waiting in long lines isn   t a big deal but with crazy twins it can make it a little challenging . Wish there was a true fast pass you could pay extra for to make the overall experience better. I   d give it a solid B grade wise but liked Universal much better ","Positive"
"It's for my kids love of Disney that brings me to this theme place otherwise I would not come even if it's free admission. While few staff are helpful and courteous many staff are rude. All those time we come here it's always a bad experience mainly because it's so crowded, long line everywhere, parking, rides, restaurant, bathrooms etc and even malfunction of some rides after waiting an hour. The fast pass is not even worth anything.","Negative"
"Quintessential Disney. We were unsure of what to expect, but being Disney, how bad could it be? We have been to Orlando many many times and its been done to death. This park is much smaller and rides are similar, maybe with a different name, but similar to whats in Orlando. One big difference was Toy Story land, which reminded me of Hollywood Studios. These rides we hadn't seen before and they were super fun, even for an 11 and 13 year old. The lines in August were what you'd expect, most 45 minutes  if not more. We stayed at Disney property and were given what was basically fast passes for some of the rides. All of the rides didn't accept this pass, but the ones that did, we just went on the same 5 rides or so twice.","Positive"
"Attached is a letter that I wrote to Disneyland Paris summarizing my experiences there. I hope it is helpful to other prospective visitors. Dear Disneyland Paris, I am writing to you to inform you of the discriminatory and unacceptable actions of your employees against guests with disabilities. I am an adult (age 23) wheelchair user who visited your park on Saturday, 4 March, 2017 with my aide. The first disaster occurred upon attempting to enter the Disneyland hotel. Our hotel in Paris (the Shangri la) had arranged with our driver and with the Disneyland hotel for us to enter the park through the Disneyland hotel for wheelchair accessibility reasons. Shangri la gave Disneyland our names and information. We were stopped by security, and even after presenting our passports and my wheelchair, we were denied access into the hotel area and forced to enter the park through less accessible entrance. The second problem occurred with security and bag check. There was no clear line for wheelchair users and the employees ushering us in were uninformed. Because I was carrying a bag, I was asked after a long wait to join the wheelchair inaccessible line in the pouring rain, which caused further delays. Nearly half an hour later, we were finally able to attend the park. The third problem was inside the park at the information desk, where I experienced great difficulty obtaining a priority pass, despite having arrived prepared with ample documentation. Although I am above average height (165cm), the desk was so high that I could barely make eye contact with the employee attending to us, who was extremely rude and refused to speak with or look at me, only addressing my aide and asking her to sign everything. I am a university educated adult (who will soon earn a master   s degree) with a physical disability, but I was treated as though I were a child or had an intellectual disability. I was also informed on your website that my aide could enter the park free, but was told that this was not possible once I tried to enter the park and could not receive a refund.The fourth problem was the lack of accessible ramps and misinformation given by employees. There were few signs directing us to accessible entrances, and employees were unhelpful in guiding us to wheelchair ramps, either shrugging or blatantly giving misinformation when they did not know the answer. Many of the few ramps that were available were steeper than legal regulations mandate and were difficult to navigate.The fifth and most discriminatory problem was the treatment I received by employees who were managing the rides. This happened at multiple attractions.After entering Peter Pan   s wheelchair accessible entrance, I was asked by an attendant to wait for several minutes. When he finally returned, I handed my priority pass to him, expecting to board the ride. He shook his head and said,    People like you aren   t allowed on this ride.    I explained that I could transfer myself from the wheelchair to the ride, but he responded that his    boss    told him not to let wheelchair users enter. He said if I wished to enter the ride, I could wait in the standard queue. I explained to him that my wheelchair would not fit in the standard queue. He shrugged, said,    That   s the way it is,    and walked away.At It   s a Small World, I entered the accessible entrance and patiently waited to board the boat. I was asked by two different employees who were not in contact with each other if I needed a    special    boat or if I could board a    normal    one. I told them that I was capable of entering the normal boat. They told me my wait time was two minutes, but proceeded to keep me waiting for fifteen minutes before they got me a    special    boat, which I did not need.At Autopia, there was a trash bin placed on the wheelchair ramp that blocked my entrance to the attraction. I attempted to get the attention of the employees, who looked at me but did not move the bin. Once I entered the Autopia car, a female attendant moved my wheelchair directly into the rain. When my aide complained afterward, the attendant rudely said,    This is not my problem.    My wheelchair was soaked, despite the fact that ample sheltered space was available to park the chair.The worst experience I had (and the reason we promptly exited the park afterward) was at the Indiana Jones roller coaster ride at 3:00 3:40pm. I entered the wheelchair accessible entrance and waited behind about five other guests. The attendant asked for my name and priority pass, which I provided. After the guests before me boarded the ride, she told me that my aide and I would be next. Afterward, she said I needed to wait longer, and switched twice with two other attendants, who told me the same thing. I proceeded to wait for approximately 40 minutes, even though I was next in line while FORTY OTHER GUESTS WHO HAD ARRIVED AFTER US were allowed to board. The park was not very busy, so if the normal line had been accessible, the wait would have been shorter. I asked several times why I could not board, and the employees said,    There are many people here,    refusing to give me an answer. I patiently explained that there were only two of us and that I could easily transfer onto the ride, but they said that my wheelchair was a problem. When I was eventually granted access, there was no one behind us in line. Literally every single person who had arrived after us had already gone on the ride. When I told the employees that what they had done was irresponsible, they verbally mocked me.The constant discrimination I faced in your park is ableist, illegal, and embarrassingly outdated. Your disorganized Paris employees made it clear that I was not a welcomed guest and treated me with disdain and disgust, as though my disability was a burden with which they were forced to deal, rather granting me the equal respect that I am entitled to as a human being. As someone who has previously enjoyed countless positive experiences at Disneyland Anaheim, I was outraged by the way I was treated in your Paris park. I demand an answer and for your park to be held accountable. I can be contacted at the following addresses and expect your explanation and resolution immediately.","Negative"
"Spent two days there and had a good experience......but we visited paris disney last year so in comparison to that the staff didnt seem to be very up to the standard....though there were some who were really helpful.Like disney paris has the concept of the character autographs which my kids really enjoyed but everytime we asked the staff at HK disney they seemed a lil annoyed. The afternoon and evening parade were both amazing. Overall fun days spent...Disney is magical as always","Positive"
"Compared to Disney and other parks in USA this asian version of Disney is a small and modest park.Considering population and increasing wealth of the area, considering also the awakening of Chinese people for entertainment, I would think this should be the greatest park of the brand, or the greatest ever....Hope they have plans to explore this amazing market with outstanding attractions","Neutral"
"I hate to give Disney a bad review but I have not been to Hong Kong Disneyland in about four years and I was a bit disappointed today. It was just not quite    on pointe    and lacked some of that    Disney Magic   . Small things were out of place... for example some of the lights not working and the rain chains not lying correctly in the rain forest scene in    it   s a small world   , a maintenance man fixing a gate that was not even being used (with all his tools on the ground in front of him) in the line of    Ironman Experience    while visitors were walking by to ride and the majority of the non performing cast members looking like they hated their jobs   no smiles.We were looking forward to seeing the new Moana show but the venue is absolutely ridiculous. Only three rows of seats in an area that could accommodate a lot more and not much shade cover so unless you got the seats, you had to stand in the hot sun for 20 minutes to watch. That made the entire show very unenjoyable and was a real downer. The kids hated it and said it was the worst part of their day. It   s seriously just seemed like Disney took the cheap route to create a new entertainment item.Also, we did not see it posted anywhere, not even on the Disneyland app, that they now close the rides in the back of the park one hour before closing time    We wasted time walking to the back of the park to ride some of those rides again and we would have changed our evening schedule had we known they would close early. We used to love riding the Mine Cars in the dark before the park closed.My sister was visiting us and is an avid Disney fan. She said,    No wonder no one comes to this Disneyland. The park is not open enough hours to get your money   s worth, they close some of the rides early and there is not a lot of shade cover compared to the other hot location, Walt Disney World in Florida.   I expect more from Disney. Thankfully, the new Light Parade is fantastic and so the day ended with that classic    Disney Magic   .","Neutral"
"We stayed 6 nights October half term holidays and had a brilliant time. Our 2nd visit. We booked fast passes for 6 days as queues are long. The park is a smaller version of Disney in Florida with same zones like Adventure Land etc. The park map lists everything so you see the big rides and can plan your visit   we did all the big rides first nice and early ahead of the queues and went back to the zones at leisure. Or you can go one zone at a time but some queues are 35 80 mins for the popular rides but it's entirely upto you. The park is fantastic   we did some of the rides 5 6 times. The park is well laid out   plenty of places to rest and of course spend your money. There are lots of eateries and we tried them all and they were all seriously awful   massive queues   the food is ridiculously expensive, bland, tasteless rubbish. We tried pizzas, BBQ you name it   the BBQ food was stone cold, told us to use the microwaves at the back of restaurant to heat it up! With hungry kids there is nothing you can do. The park was spotless and the zone scenery is fab. The parades are fantastic you have to line the route 30mins before it starts to get a front view but be prepared for rude people to push you and your kids out the way! The Disney characters do photo ops around the park. Some really helpful staff. Sat & Sun are the busiest days as all the French tend to visit en mass. So many people walk around smoking and don't care if they burn you or the kids as they pass! That said   we loved it and hope to go back.","Positive"
"Book tickets in advance on the disneylandwebsite.  Use the fastpass wherever it is possible.  Don'tcome on the weekend....  Great attractions for kids","Positive"
"Were there during the holiday season.Extremely frustrating. Old fast pass system...come on, get into the modern era. Very long lines (1 2 hours for every little attraction). But the worst? ALL of the main attractions were stopped for maintenance at least once during our 3 days trip! ALL OF THEM! We had a fastpass for thunder mountain. Sure enough it broke just when it was our turn. During the same time, space mountain was also under maintenance. That is 2 out of 3. While we were in line for Buzz, it broke too! The only reason we were able to see Ratatouille at the studios is because we saw it was reopening up after a couple of hours of downtime so we waited in line for reopening and saved a good hour wait that way. That is how desperate people were, queuing for a closed attraction just in case it might by chance reopen that day!This is ridiculous. Never saw so many attractions down on my cumulative 25  trips to the US parks as I saw in Euro disney in one trip!!! Shame on you Disney, you are tarnishing a spectacular brand by not giving this park the right level of support. Close it if you cannot maintain it.","Neutral"
"We spent 1 Day in Disneyland.The kids loved it, my wife and I less so!The length of time queuing for rides was ridiculous, The food was terrible and over priced.Some adults need to have a good hard look at themselves, hogging rides for 4 year olds and pushing in for rides!","Neutral"
"For the tourists who have never been to the Disney at Paris or in the US, one can go here then! If you have been to those places, give this a miss! Not that great in comparison","Neutral"
"I'm in a wheelchair and need a companion to push me around the park and tend to my personal needs, so I brought my husband along for that role. The park refused, saying that because he also has a disability he was  not fit and proper to be a companion .","Negative"
"I don't remember very well how good Disney in Hong Kong was as I went around 2008 but from what I do remember, it was no where near as good as the 4 parks in Florida. It had something missing, not enough rides and just...More","Neutral"
"After all this years, Disneyland Paris has been stuck with a reputation of being Disney lite. Unloved by the French, frequented by the Brits but lacking the glamour and sheen of its American parents.This was our third visit to DLP. No visit to Paris is complete without a day trip to the park and our youngest had yet to visit. We have previously been to the original Disneyland in California as well as WDW in Orlando. DLP cannot rise to the heights of those parks despite the similar rides and in one or two cases having better rides such as Space Mountain.Its deficiencies are hard to overlook. The staff border on incompetence. There is no meeting and greeting, no Disney smiles (except one cast member who got into the spirit and realised that he works for the House of Mouse). The first ride we went to was Space Mountain, it had short waiting time. As we had a little one we did a parent swap which meant my wife stayed behind until I completed the ride. After I finished, did they let her on? No, every time my wife went up to them they kept shoving her away. We were in the parent swap segment and were just ignored as they let others on to the ride. This went on for 15 minutes. She would have been better of going to the normal line. It   s this kind of attitude that upsets visitors and gives the park a bad rep.Of course after all this years, its never going to get better because I am sure the management have knowledge of this but probably are not bothered to make improvements or correct these deficiencies.As we managed to make best use of Fast pass in Orlando, we tried the same trick here with mixed success. We waited for some rides, got on a few with a minimum of fuss, and went on several rides on FP but the FP wait times were rather long. Overall we did a good selection of attractions, enjoyed a fish and chips lunch although as expected it was expensive. Disappointingly the Haunted House broke as we waited to get on.We lined up for the daily parade. It was nice to see other adults realising that Disney is primarily for kids and making an effort that other children can get to the front or have a good vantage point. Also, the disabled section actually consisted of people who were entitled to be there in contrast with what I saw in Orlando last year. The parade itself was laughable. I already mentioned Disney staff failed to get in the spirit of things but the parade was so short. They filled in many of the characters strutting their stuff but it was just a few floats and it must have been Tigger   s day off as he was missing from the rest of the Pooh cast.Overall, its great for kids, good to go if you have never done Disney before but it could had been so much more, alas this park shall always be a lightweight and no amount of pixie dust will make a difference.","Neutral"
"My husband and i decided to take the Eurostar to Disney Paris. We stayed at the Disney hotel right inside the park for a two nights 3 day visit, a big mistake. This is apparently a 5* hotel. On arrival we had to check in, there were 5 check in desks and only 2 of them actually manned resulting in long queues, after waiting for over half an hour we were finally given our room keys. The room itself was fine if a little tierd. Both the room and bathroom were acceptably clean. There were tea and coffee facilities but after using the kettle once it broke and was not successfully replaced in spite of frequent requests. The food in the hotels restaurants was appalling. The breakfasts were ALL cold, piles of food of all kinds sitting on a counter with just a couple of small infra red lamps to supposedly keep it hot. In fact all the food in the hotel was uneatable. Our daughter, son in law and children stayed in the same hotel but in the more expensive Castle Suites a month previously, again they found the quality of the food uneatable. After this we decided to eat, instead, in the park. We had to queue at every single place, in McDonalds the queue was over an hour long, the other restaurants were no better, there was also nowhere to sit down as they were all so crowded. As for the rides attractions, queues again were over an hour long, sometimes two. Children we   re miserable, crying and moaning standing in these huge queues. We had fast track but only one of the attractions we wanted to visit had the fast track facility. Disney put on a fireworks display on the lake. This was a complete waste of time as everyone was herded to a place that had a huge globe in front of it completely blocking everyone   s view, utterly ridiculous. On the third day it rained heavily so we bought macs, yet again the queue was over half an hour long with only two tills working.On the plus side once we did manage to enter the attractions they were excellent, and all the Disney characters utterly charming, the shows were excellent with very talented performers, it   s such a shame that all of that was ruined by the rest of it. We would certainly never go again.","Negative"
"This was such a fun day! The characters are all mimes so they don't have an odd accent. Every ride is in English with English speaking actors. The ques aren't too bad except for the Winnie the pooh ride which is really long! The heat is not ideal for ques. Every ride has had a lot of thought go into it, almost identical to Americas! Such a great day even the train there is decorated in Disney : )","Positive"
"People asked if my fiance and I were going to DLP with children   'no' we said, looking astonished, 'why would we?' We had a fabulous time   even cynical ol' us were excited by having our photo taken with Minnie Mouse...! Disney sort of sweeps you up in its exuberance.The Park is amazing   what impressed us most was the incredible use of space. You can actually walk from one end of the Park to the other in about 10 minutes (although not in a straight line!) but they have crammed so many rideas and attractions into the space it feels a lot bigger. There is judicious use of flower beds and trees, and it feels a lot less 'plasticky' than I expected. The gardeners are to be congratulated   the flowers were all blooming and the topiary was amazing. Apparently 5million flowers are planted every year!RidesWell, we found as two 29 year olds that the park is clearly divided into Children and Adult rides. The rollercoasters mostly fall into the latter category, with Space Mountain, Indiana Jones and Thunder Mountain being the best (although we both felt our heads were knocked around a lot on Space Mountain and I wondered briefly about whiplash   definitely not one to go on if you have EVER had a neck injury! Indiana Jones gives the same buzz without the headache, although to our disappointment it does not go backwards as claimed in our guidebook!) The kiddie rides are imaginative but less appealing for adults, although we particularly enojyed Pirates of the Caribbean, Le Pays de Contes de Fees (a cruise around miniature storybook scenes), Casey Junior (all right, it's a little train for kids but we liked it!) and actually Peter Pan's Flight was rather sweet, although too jerky to give you the impression that you really are flying!The other rides are enjoyable but you have to remember the park is aimed at kids and not expect too much in the way of trickery thrills. It's a Small World is puke inducing in its pink frillyness but certainly a masterpiece of engineering! Star Tours feels strangely dated. Honey I shrunk the Audience is fun. We also went on the train that goes all the way round the park   if you're hoping to be able to see the whole park you'll be disappointed; they've even concealed the park from the train! Very clever but slightly frustrating.We were well aware that we were going to the Parks in peak season and so were prepared for long queues. However, following advice on tripadvisor we got to the park every morning at 9am when it opened   and it was brilliant. For about 2 hours you can literally walk onto the rides   even in August   and it's really very bearable. After that it gets very very busy (but we tended to go back to the hotel in the afternoon and then return in the evening) and other people and their children become very irritating! Fastpass is a fantastic invention and you really should make use of it if you want to do the big rides. Most of the rollowercoasters have at least two 'trains' going round so the queues do move, but we did pass signs for 70 or 80 minutes wait during the lunchtime period. Strangely, Peter Pan seemed to be the one with the longest queues!ParadesWe saw all three on one day. 'The Wonderful World of Disney' was at 7pm and included some huge floats of the Disney characters. Very impressive and a lot of fun but we did have to stand several rows back as we weren't prepared to sit on the kerb for an hour beforehand to reserve a place! Our favourite was definitely the Fantillusion Parade at 10.30pm   really beautiful use of lights synchronised with music. The Wishes display at 11.15pm was amazing for the use of projection onto the castle and the use of lasers   very clever. The fireworks were okay but nothing particularly special.ShowsWe only saw one   the Lion King show. Great fun and a potted version of the story with all the main songs. Strange mix of Disney type furry costumes and the more sophisticated costume design of the West End Broadway show. Performers were obviously giving it their all though, and the singing was excellent.If you want to see a show, beware. You have to queue at certain times of the day at the Videopolis in Discoveryland, and the queues get VERY long in a short space of time (they close the Discoveryland station at this time). The tickets go quickly and people are often turned away disappointed. After missing the evening 'slot' for tickets (the sign at Main Street said 'sold out' even before they were supposed to have given the tickets out   apparently they count people in the queue!) the next day my fiance queued for an hour for tickets. However, there are ways round it. There is a fast food restaurant in Videopolis, and if you order your meal cannily you can catch the show from the top part of the auditorium. Wish we'd thought of that!Studio ParksWe really enjoyed the buzz at this park. Obviously, it's smaller and less famous, but the Rock n Roller Coaster with music by Aerosmith was so good we went on it twice in a row (two rides on that by 9.15am   see, it pays to get there early!) We also enjoyed Armageddon, which is suitably silly and requires audience participation (those staff work HARD, I tell you!) and the Studio Tram Tour, although we didn't feel that it was worth the hour long queue. The bit in Catastrophe Canyon was good though   fire and water rushing towards you! We also heartily recommend the Moteur Action show   the audience stand holds thousands of people and it's a great show, full of stunt driving and effects. What really makes it is the use of cameras during the show, projecting the shots onto a big screen. Plus, they also show you how the stunts are done, which we found fascinating. We also enjoyed the Animagique show, which involves Donald Duck (speaking in English) and Mickey Mouse (speaking in French) and an adventure into various Disney films all in UV light   very attractive.OverallLots of fun   we had a three day hopper and it's definitely value for money. The variety of attractions is huge and there's always something to look at. Most of the rides give you information in three languages, and all the staff have a smattering of three languages. We think we saw the best of the Parks by structuring our day as we did   going very early and then taking the afternoon off is definitely recommended.One ride nobody tells you about is actually not in the Parks at all. The Panoramagique balloon is at the other end of Disney Village (we don't really recommend Planet Hollywood   had better burgers from our local butcher...but they do good cocktails!) and costs 12 euros for a 10 minute or so ride. The balloon is tethered permanently to the ground and rises up above the Park. It's then that you see the real genius of Disney   the layout of the car parks (completely hidden from ground view) and the hotels take up at least three times as much ground area as the Parks themselves. It's also illuminating to see the main park from the air   the roofs look terribly concrete and modern compared with the magic in the detail below! We were really pleased we managed to do this one, although of course it depends entirely on weather conditions and when we arrived in the morning we were told to come back later.What else? The thing that most impressed us about the whole experience was the attention to detail. Everything is done to make people feel as confortable as possible. The arcades that line Main Street are stunning. There is plenty of space, although of course that is used to maximum capacity during busy times. Around every corner there is something new. And you can even have your purchases delivered to your hotel so you don't have to carry them around with you all day. We didn't eat in the Park as we figured it would be very busy, but we didn't think it was that expensive really. The prices in the shops were only what you would pay for the same items in a shop in England. There are some very good quality fridge magnets, pens, keyrings etc for about   2.50 so there is plenty for pocket money purchase. The big seller seems to be the princess dresses   we saw many, many small girls dressed as Belle, or Snow White etc. And the dresses are not cheap so gird your wallet when taking small girls with you! But on the whole we didn't see what the fuss was about. You wouldn't expect to pay less than   15 for an all you can eat restaurant at a Theme Park in England   why should you in Disney? The only reason the trip is expensive is because you have to buy every meal rather than whipping up a bowl of pasta at home. Plus you are paying for the Disney experience   which, let's face it, is expensive to run. The number of staff employed in the Parks is staggering   and that includes gardeners, painters, engineers, firemen...along with the performers themselves.I think it's well worth the money, and in our three days we really felt we had seen everything we wanted and done everything we wanted. Highly recommended. We shall come back when we have children!We stayed at the Moevenpick Dream Castle Hotel   review under appropriate section.","Positive"
"First trip for three adults three children loved the different themes and great selection of rides and stores everything was decently priced my only big complaint would be the fast pass machines they should move all the fast pass machines in the middle of disney and california adventure the way they have it set up now makes for chaos and time wasted frsnctically running to different aress","Positive"
"No doubt that it is expensive, the lines are long too, but that's what happens a disney. It is a fun place to go and explore. Make sure to get fast passes and take your time, have fun!","Neutral"
"What a nightmare!!! It is so overcrowded! Sometimes you have to wait one hour or more and the attraction last 1 minute! Exemple : indiana Jones.The attractions are great, but if you go on a week end it's a real nightmare. You spend your time waiting in huge queues... It's nearly impossible to find a place to sit. So many people are sitting on the pavement... And their fastpass tickets is a joke, you take your ticket and need to wait 2 hours... so you go eleswhere...Be prepared for a looooong day when you go there...","Negative"

"In comparison with its bigger sister in Florida this parc is very small, the rides are again limited, Space Mountain was our favourite, plus the runaway train ride.The food and drink prices are pretty expensive, the car park now is about    15 for the day which again is another liberty.The queues for the rides can be rather long, avoid school holidays, we went early July but you still can't avoid them. The fast pass ticket services was giving rides times around two hours or so further on, as the rides are limited this hampers your movements, avoid the Railroad as you initially enter the parc, you can walk to the far side quicker.With the recession gripping all and sundry the parades are shorter plus character meets are few and far between.Go to Disney World Florida is my advice, is miles better than Eurodisney.","Negative"
"Went in 2010 it was expensive then, but it's way over the top now. Paid for half board. Pop up breakfast is not pop up. One morning waited over an hour.The evening meal at the Hotel Cheyenne was one of the worst I have had. The meal at the Arabica was very good but the other two at the Plaza gardens was mediocre. The ladies toilets were horrendous. Not pleasent to use at all. Lunch you are lucky if you get under    40 and that was mass produced, cold and over priced.The thing that disappointed me the most was the cost of clothing etc.    70 for a dressing gown,    50 for a sweatshirt,    25 for a t shirt and the cuddlies are    10 more than over here. Couldn't by any little presents for under    5.People smoking where they liked and not in the designated area's.More security, but I did wonder why they were there. Most of the time the guards were not actually looking at the screen to see what was in your bag as they were chatting or on mobiles.I missed the characters not coming out randomly into the park. Not sure why they don't do that, probably H&S. Only designated areas now and we only saw the usual. That took out the fun.Having said that the 25 year anniversary fireworks were stunning and Mickeys new show was fabEnjoyed trip 7 years ago..very disappointed with this one.","Negative"
"We were so looking forward to this visit after growing up as longtime pass holders. Our daughter   s special needs were not accommodated or acknowledged by staff. Ignored by characters... We won   t be back.   Universal Studios really saved our vacation.","Negative"
"If you are coming to Paris don't waste your time here. A truly appalling experience and one that will see your wallet empty.We went yesterday at the insistence of our 3 kids. We are living in Paris so understand all about Paris prices. First off the cost: huge and you get little for it. Add in train fares from Paris a fast food lunch and the cost all up with admission for a family of 5 was about 460 euros or about US$630. For this you could fly from Paris to Dublin and back with the family for a whole weekend. Now this huge cost might not be so bad if you actually got something for your money. The queues are massive. The electronic signs at each ride showed lines of anything from 60 minutes to 120 minutes  for a 90 second ride. There is a 'Fastpass' system where you go to the ride and register for it later that day but the time lag between registering and riding was yesterday about 5 hours and you can only register for 2 rides. End result: you are wandering around the crowds getting frustrated and wondering why you are there. Ask yourself: do you have the stomach for a queue like this, running into hours with children in tow? Or even without them.Despite best efforts of our teenagers (who like all their generation seem to know how to work the system) my kids got on only 3 rides between arriving at 11:30am and leaving at 6:30pm. We visited in early Spring on a Saturday and out of European school holidays. The mind boggles as to what it would be like in Summer at peak time.How do you fill in the rest of your time? Well there are plenty of shops selling Disney themed things (did you come to ride or buy?) and places with long queues for fast food  a gastronomic crime in a country like France.So in summary: it's overpriced by a huge margin, particularly when you consider the many magnificent attractions Paris itself has to offer; you don't get what you paid for. At 60 Euros admission per person and 3 rides per person that's 20 Euros a ride. If there were modest queues (2 hours is not acceptable!) then you might feel you had received something for your money, but that is not the case by a huge margin.So my recommendation? Give it a wide berth and visit some of the fantastic things that Paris has on offer. Don't waste your Parisian holiday here.","Negative"
"After traveling to many different places in America recently we decided to visit Disneyland and California Park at the end of our trip before returning to Australia. We were very disappointed when we arrived with prepaid tickets to find out that between the two parks there were 12 major rides closed. I cannot understand how they can charge the same price and close so many attractions?We complained but very little understanding or compassion was shown. I will certainly be advising anyone who is planning to visit to phone before buying tickets to find out which rides are not operating.","Negative"
"I live on the east coast,and have been to Disney World several times. I wanted to see where it all began. For two years I planned and waited to go to Disneyland. The first thing I saw was the not so impressive castle. It looks like a shack compared to WDW castle. I then noticed Disneyland has an aversion to bathroom signs and signs in general really. I stayed on property and the magic hours were not magical unless you are five. It just allows you to be first in line waiting for the rest of the park to open. Then there are the strollers. I hate the double wides. I know they are a necesity, but some parents wield them like weapons. And why do so many parents with only small children, who will never remember any of this, even bother going? Is it fun dragging tired children around an amusement park? Then there were the rides, the ones that were open that is. Why does a company that makes billions of dollars close that many rides at one time? Indiana Jones, Pirates, Nemo, Small World, Alice In Wonderland.The rides that were open broke down several times. Matterhorn broke down right before I was about to board, and no pass for later just a  come back later and get in line, sorry . Didn't they rehab that ride a few years ago? Big Thunder Mountain was excellent. The complete re do was well worth it. Cars is awesome, even though its in CA. Haunted Mansion was great, but I felt cheated with so many rides closed.It would be fine if I was a local, but I don't know if I'll ever make it back. The prices for food and the variety were what you would expect from Disney, but how about some more ride specific merchandise.Why can't I get a Big Thuinder t shirt? Was it worth it? Once probably but I don't know if I'll ever go back.","Neutral"
"Don't let the thought of long lines put you off, we were there labour day weekend and wait times were only 10 mins, and they went really fast. Favorite ride was Indiana jones and pirates of the carribean","Positive"
"We spent 4 days visiting Disneyland Paris, i have visited many times since 1997. This is the place of dreams,where kids get to meet their favourite Disney characters and go on many magical rides. But this place is looking dated and a bit scruffy in places. Things are VERY expensive compared to UK prices. Ice creams are around 4 euro each which can be expensive if you have a few kids. Drinks are around the same price. The Disney shops on site are also very expensive, you are paying extra for the Disneyland paris logo! Small disney pens cost nearly 4 euro each, postcards 2 euro, kids tshirts 13 euro, adults tshirts 20 euro and disney cups approximately 14 euro or more! The parade seems to have been shortened since last time i was there, but the kids still loved it. The worst bit was queuing, especially to see characters. We waited over an hour to see Tigger and people were just going to the front of the queue and the Disney staff just let them in before everyone else!! Some people were also quite aggressive when queuing for rides, some italian guy literally pulled me and my 2 year old out of the dumbo ride because he wanted that colour dumbo!!! No Disney staff dare upset people, so they just let these things happen! On a more positive note, the light show on a night is not to be missed, it is fantastic, definately the high point of our visit. One tip is to go to the rides which have long queues such as peter pan, dumbo, rollercoasters etc when the parade is on, there are hardly any queues and we got on most of the rides with 15 minutes. I think that Disney in florida is a much better and cheaper option. You can get hotel and flights for less than   500 each for 2 weeks. Also prices of food, gifts etc is much cheaper than Paris. We will definately do this next time. We enjoyed Disneyland paris overall, but its overpriced and having to put up with queue jumpers and arrogant people is something you will definately come across!","Neutral"
"This was my first trip to Disneyland with children and my first back to a Disney park since 1991. I don't think the French can pull off that happiest place on Earth vibe. It mystifies me how the staff in the LA park can do it   I recall that to a person every staff member in the park seemed happy. It is not like the staff in the Paris park are grumpy or rude and some of them are very very friendly and seem to be enjoying their jobs but most are just going through the motions. Don't get me wrong   Paris Disneyland is still fun, but it is not magic. The other thing that struck me is how little has changed since 1991 and I think DIsneyland has fallen behind in the rides department. All of the future world should be scrapped and re done. The only world that stands up to time is the fantasyland. Its a small world is still magical and the small rides are a delight for the kids. The merchandise was outrageously overpriced and the food was overpriced and bad   not that we tried to much of it quickly deciding to eat just outside of the park at the Earl of Sandwich where an excellent hot sandwich ran 5.50 and a 250m bottle of rose was 4.40   and I needed that after a day in Disneyland with a 2 and 4 year old.","Neutral"
"My favorite place in the entire world. Amazing staff, incredible entertainment, and fantastically detailed & imaginative rides. Been going since I was a child and it only gets better. Make sure to see the new Disneyland Forever Fireworks and Paint the Night parade for the 60th Anniversary Celebration. For those who had visited during or around the 90's: Paint the Night is an updated version of the beloved Electrical Parade.","Positive"
"Just returned from five days here. I was with a friend and her 4 year old daughter so we were mainly concerned with the rides for younger children. The rides were as expected and the best part was the Micky magician show which was full of magic and everyone really enjoyed that. The minus was the lack of service and customer care. It was over 90 degrees each day and on the second day we went to the ice cream parlour at around noon and found it shut, a member of staff said it would open at 1.30, a second person said one o'clock and then it was opened at quarter to one after a family of five had just been told it wasn't opening. The third day we were told the ice cream parlour wasn't opening til 3.30 in the afternoon. There were little stalls selling ice lollies but it wasn't the same. We went to go on the Aladdin ride but it was closed with technical difficulties, the same with the Pinocchio ride. So keep your plan flexible as not all rides available when they say they will be open. The same with restaurants   not all restaurants are open each evening so our plans had to change. Very different experience to Florida mainly due to staff attitude andfacilities not being open.","Negative"
"You have to walk almost 20 Kilometers to cover the park.. also the wait time at each ride is atleast 30 45 minutes and fun experience of only 2 3 minutes... really awefull in terms of fooding options","Neutral"
"This is my second visit. In the off season a lot of rides are closed with no corresponding drop in rates. Monorail running at less capacity or broken forcing scores to get off and walk gets up and running 5 min later with angry and tired customers in huge lines at maingate. I went to city hall to get my kids a first visit badge and heard someone complaining so they gave him some fast passes. I also then complained and got 2 fast passes which was nice. We did enjoy what we did for the most part but skipped most  Popular  rides. To be fair, we are more nature oriented. Kids loved Astro blasters and luckily line was reasonable. We had fun but frustrated at all the closures. Would have expected to pay less than the $800for 2days for a family of 4. Will not be back again soon. Food was surprisingly good and a decent value for the environment. Liked the innoventions centre, and magical map although cast or wanna be cast members in the audience were a real distraction as they danced and jumped around and hooted and hollered the whole way through the show (they knew all the songs and moves and seemed to know the performers), ruining my enjoyment. They may have been impaired.","Neutral"
"The park was a maaaajor disappointment for us adults. It only had one ride for adults   the famous Space Mountain   & that was it. And all the attractions were miniature sized! There was no variety in any of the services ranging from food to shopping. And everything was overpriced including the tickets. We arrived at the park at 10am, and left by 1pm. There was nothing to do there. A waste of precious time & money.","Negative"
"Maybe just an off day , but most of the rides we spent queuing up ending up breaking down , over priced food and drink","Neutral"
"Maybe September is not a big month for Disney Hong Kong or maybe it was the weather, but several rides were not open. Our biggest disappointment was that Buzz Lightyear had closed the previous weekend forever. It will be rebranded as part of a new theme being developed in that area. The line at Buzz was always not too long (like Orlando) so we would ride it over and over again. I guess we're stuck with trying to get fast passes in Orlando in the future.The Lion King was very good with some changes improvements from the last time we visited. The only bad part is the wait to get in.Hong Kong Disney size wise is nothing like Orlando so if that is what you are expecting you will be disappointed greatly. It is worth at least one visit (we've been 3 times) just to do something other than go downtown with the crowds. We've never experienced the lines of Orlando so the wait time is much shorter and you can cover all the rides easily in a day. It's just not as  magic  as Orlando and everything is smaller   even the castle. It's a small world ride is as good as Orlando though.","Neutral"
"Stayed here in 2011 and this time went up to Sequoia Lodge which was awesome. Fab. Lovely hotel and each day was full of fun. The odd queue here and there but nothing too bad. Food was ok. Main thing it was a family holiday with x2 under 5 at the time and a memorable holiday for us. Took the car over from the UK. Kids love Eurotunnel as did Daddy! I will cherish this holiday for the rest of time. One proud Dad. Wife had a fab time too so that makes it all the better.","Positive"
"Amazing feeling   like being a kid again! Do not miss this, no matter how old you are. It just fills you with the best feeling. Leave yourself plenty of time and then hit Downtown Disney for great shopping and food.","Positive"
"Sadly the illusion of Disneyland was greater than the reality. Our first visit was on the Monday and it was excessively packed with people, strollers and mobility scooters. The main street is under construction which made for a lot of congestion and the queues for the rides was never ending and then sadly the rides fell well below expectations. We visited the park again on the Wednesday and the crowds were reduced minimally but made for a lightly better experience but again the rides are a huge disappointment compared to a lot of the rides at other parks around the world. We enjoyed California Adventure Park a lot more and would recommend spending your time there.I was disappointed that you hardly got to see any of the Parks Characters and when we finally did see Mickey the lady had cut off the line so we missed out on a photo with him. Never saw any Disney Princesses over the two day period which again was a huge disappointment.The reality of Disneyland is over priced food, poor   average rides and lots of standing around in queues. The free Fast Pass every 2 hours worked good and that saved us a long wait on a couple of rides and we had downloaded the Disney App to be able to see what the wait times were around the park, so I definitely suggest you download that.Pack plenty of food and snacks water in your back pack so at least you can eat while standing in the long lines!","Neutral"
"Growing up Disneyland was amazing, and I thought maybe as I got older the feeling would wear off. But thank goodness that doesnt seem to be the case. Disney takes such great pride in their attention to detail and it rings through the entire park. The only thing that bothers me is how dirty the water is around the castle and other attractions and more importantly the smell. But other than that minor detail it is a great place to spend the day.","Positive"
"The Newport Hotel is fantastic location, great decor, you feel like you are on a cruise ship, great staff and very helpful. Rooms very roomy, beds very comfortable, pillows were great for sleeping. Walk to Disney Village or get on the free shuttle bus. We bought the 1 2 board package and found this extremely good value, and spent a little extra to go to Wild Bill's dinner show was a fantastic night.","Positive"
"My husband and I planned a trip with our toddler and infant to California for the first time in February 2019. My Mom mentioned that this was the quiet time for Disney and she bought my daughter a 3 day pass for her third birthday (so we also had to buy 3 day passes for ourselves costing over $400). What a mistake. We were done with Disney after just one day. All you do all day long is wait in lines. You   ll wait in line to get into the parking lot, then you   ll wait in line to use the elevator in the parking lot (only 2 elevators in the entire parking garage for a park that accommodates 44,000 people, most of whom have strollers or wheelchairs), you will then wait in line to get to security, and then wait in line at security to be screened and to have them dig through all of your belongings, then you will wait in line for the tram, then you will wait in line for tickets (if you didn   t buy them beforehand online), and then you will wait in line to FINALLY get into the park (all of this usually took about an hour minimum). Then you will wait in line for a ride (sometimes a 2 hour wait), then you will wait in line to meet a single Disney character (usually a 30 40 minute wait), then you will wait in a line for crappy overpriced food, then you will wait in a line to see one of the shows, then you will wait in line to use a single change table in the washrooms (there should be more than one change table in the washrooms at a children   s theme park), then you will wait in line trying to buy a souvenir, then you will wait in line to get back on the tram, and then you will wait in line in traffic trying to exit the park. This place is a massive waste of time and money. Never again. We   ll take our kids somewhere that our precious time together won   t be wasted.","Negative"
"If you plan to visit Disneyland Park in only 1 day try to get the fastpass for as many rides as possible. When we visited (on a Saturday) it was extremely crowded (had to wait in line 45 min   1 hr for each attraction) but it was nice as a one time experience. We only tried the more adult rides (space mountain twice, indiana jones the temple of peril, phantom manor, star tours) and even got stuck in one of the them (Big Thunder)   they got us a fastpass as compensation for the same day (but in the end the ride was not repaired before we left so we missed the chance to enjoy it).It is a very large park (32 attractions) and carefully decorated. However for the amount of money paid (60 eur per person for ticket bought online) they should better manage the influx of people. To queue for almost an hour in order to get on a 1 min ride is not extremely satisfying.","Neutral"

"This was the first Disneyland my partner and I visited and it didn't live up to expectations.It is a fairly small Disneyland relative to the other ones located in the US so this may have played a part in the disappointment.A few of the shows were interesting but we ended up towards the back of the stage and as such, visibility was a bit of a downer.The rides were not very thrilling or exciting as they were more catered towards young children or teenagers, however, the fireworks show at the end of the day was quite impressive.We wouldn't really recommend Disneyland to any other age group unless you are with your own children or have a need to satisfy a childhood desire to visit this famous theme park.","Neutral"
"I have visited Disneyland Paris ten times over the last decade and still get excited at the prospect of a visit. I visited the park on my own, with my partner and with children and have never found a fault with it.The rides are excellent   Space Mountain (been on it 65 times), Rock 'n' Roller coaster, Big Thunder Mountain   they're all great.This is definatley not the place to go if you want to lose weight. Every street, every corner has a tempting treat waiting for you. I would recommend the coffee Grinder and Plaza Gardens Restaurant on Main Street; The Cowboy Cookout in Frontierland and Buzz Lighteryears Pizza Planet in Discoveryland.If you can afford it I would definately recommend staying in one of the hotels. I have stayed in the Santa Fe, Sequoia Lodge and the Newport Bay Club. They are so close to the park and add an extra bit of magic to your stay. To keep the cost down I would also recommend the Holiday Inn hotel that is on the Disney site. Holiday Inn have 'Disneyfied' themselves quite sucessfully.For nightlife you can either go to Buffalo Bill's Wild West show or visit one of the many restaurants in the Disney Village   Cafe Mickey is great for meeting the characters or go to the Rainforest Cafe if you fancy a break from everything Disney.I have also visited Walt Disney World Florida which is in its own league. But you can not fault DLP, it is fun, the staff are friendly and helpful, it is just a great escape from reality.","Positive"
"I'm telling you what. This was a major disappointment. Enormous crowds. So thick you can't walk anywhere. Kids are hungry by the time you make it from one spot to the next. I never saw Mickey Mouse. My stoller got taken. What you think Disneyland is, and what it really is, are way Differant. It's not for kids. It's a freak show for adults. No kid will like bring hauled around in a crowd all day from one long wait plus 2 minutes of ride to the next. It was cute and Disney has done a fabulous job with entertainment but, the crowds are outrageous. And we came at a  slow  time. Also, just FYI it is  gays days  on Oct 4th at Disney. The crowd consisted of every gay man and women from allll over. It wasn't anything I'd go to if you paid me and I feel taken that I actually paid to get in this place. Not magical at all. Ps, we did love cars land.","Negative"

"Disneyland is more suitable to young kids than teenage. I bought 2 young kids and 3 teenagers with me. The teenagers claimed that it was not so adventurous enough. However to small kids below 10 years ago, they can participate and play most of the games there.Please remember to plan your time especially you want to take photos with Disney Characters, there are always long queue and small kids always run out of patient to line up. Therefore, you might need to select which characters you like the most and start from there.You can bring water bottle there coz some of the theme park does not allow you to do so. Please do so because the coffee will cost you HKD 22 and it is just an instant coffee. Dining there sure expensive, a fish and chips cost HKD 90. Overall the park is ok and clean. Kids are enjoyable.However, I think one day visit is sufficient. You are able to visit all places in one day.","Positive"

"I know I shouldn't compare it to Disney World, well there is no comparison. The staff here just don't make the experience magical. There was friendly staff and there was no language barrier but it wasn't magical. It felt like a nice theme park but not Disney.In the morning there was a Princess Parade. It was about 1  2 minutes with 6 princess dancing around and that was that. The Christmas parade also lasted about 3 minutes. I understand it's a smaller park. There also wasn't many characters. Sully is always featured in the adverts but there wasn't much monsters university things. You would have to line up for ages to meet anybody and even then there were few characters to meet. The train that goes around the park? What is that all about?  Welcome to the grand canyon ! Erm I'm looking at a big poster and a plastic cat with dodgy sound effects. I understand the reference but it was so cheap and tacky. The kids next to us didn't seem to care for it either.Also the rumors are true! People do smoke anywhere and everywhere here. The toilets were awful. I'll leave it at that!All in all I think kids would like it but adults will see the standard.","Neutral"

"When we entered the park you just get this amazing feeling of being in a fantacy place. Very soon it stopped with having technical difficulties on two rides and the lines were closed. This is really unacceptable for Disney resort standards. The waiting times were unacceptably long. Pity the whole day was not on the same standard as our initial perception. ","Neutral"
"Why didn't anyone tell me there weren't any fast & scary rides here? I was expecting a small kids area and then an older adult area. None of the rides are exciting and scary like at a Six Flags. Everything is pretty but kind of boring, so much better for children. I would not recommend this place for the thrill seekers. My husband and I were there on a Tuesday and the longest line we saw was 40 minutes. It was fun day, but I would only go so a child can experience it.","Positive"

"We visited Disneyland with our 12 year old son. He enjoyed a lot, but not much to see. Very few rides and it's just a fun filled outing. It's not worth to stay inside Disneyland, as one day is more than enough to look around. It is just a mini Disneyland. Don't miss the parade which starts around 7.30 pm, it's really amazing to watch all Disney characters walk around. Overall it would be fun for kids going for the first time.","Neutral"
"It was fun to go to HK Disneyland. We stayed at one of the Disney hotels and took the private bus there. We had pre purchased tickets   and be aware that there is a great senior discount!This was my first Disneyland in Asia, and my understanding is that Tokyo Disneyland is better. Disneyland HK is smaller than the two parks in the US. It was oddly similar, and yet oddly different. The park was clean. Small World was being refurbished when we were there, so we were not able to check it out. Some fun things to note:1. They have Star Wars chopsticks in the Star Wars shop! Wish I'd bought more. 2. We had Indian food for lunch, and it was spicy but good.3. They had the usual Disney signs with rules before you get on a ride, but I don't recall seeing  You should be sober  as part of the instructions in Anaheim or Orlando! Disneyland is out on Lantau Island. Although we had fun, I would probably spend my time doing other things next time.","Positive"
"Thoroughly enjoyed it. Lots of walking involved, and some waiting. Download the Disneyland waiting time app to see which lines are longest, and January is the best time to go. This place is not just for kids.","Positive"
"Took our 2 teen boys for their second visit to Disneyland, they went when they were very young and didn   t remember. We arrived about 9am and park wasn   t too crowded then and hit the haunted mansion regular line (only about 15 min wait at that time while we waited for our first fast pass (big thunder). I recommend the extra $10 for the max pass as means you can book your fast passes using your phone without walking around the park to get the physical tickets. This saves time and your feet....also you get the photopass option included allowing you to download the photos later. As a regular to Walt Disney World I recommend booking at least one table service restaurant well before you go, yes they are a bit expensive, but it enables you to rest the feet and relax away from the queues and crowds. If your kids are a bit older and if you can pace yourself, stay until after 10pm when the fireworks finishes, it is much cooler and the queues on the high demand rides drop right off as many people leave. Between the hours of 10pm and 12pm when the park closes we hit about 3 of the really popilar rides including Nemos Submarine and almost no queues.","Positive"
"Where to start... How about with the apparent overcrowding at the park. The corporation needs to start thinking about the quality of the experience they are offering. There were no lines that were under a half hour, some fast track lines being 30 40 mins long still. There is very little shade to escape the heat. Don't bother with the 'cinema'   it's 6 screens in one room showing 6 different movies and no seating  unless you sit on the wood floor. Food lines were ridiculous! Over half an hour in line for prepared chicken nuggets and chips (food quality was good however). The deceptive lines were the annoying part   lined up for the jungle cruise that looked like it was reasonable to find it was a 2 level maze of lines that went on forever... Upon returning to California we will not spend another cent at this park, next time will be Universal or like.","Negative"
"I decided to do both parks while I was there for the Run Disney Weekend. This is my review for the Park (Studio was great).I wish I hadn't book a 2 park ticket. I only managed to get on one ride and that was the Pirates of the Caribbean. The waiting times for the other rides were out of this world! So much so, I gave up and went back to my hotel. The Single Rider queues were full of families. Parents were leaving their children alone in the queue! The only time I saw staff remove families from the single rider queues was in at the Studios.People had no respect for others. Queue jumping was rife! Staff did make an attempt to prevent this and send people to the back of the queue but as soon as they turned their backs, away these dreadful people went.And the smoking! I thought maybe smoking was allowed, being a non smoker I'm not too sure about the rules in each country... until I walked pass a smoking area.Positive   the staff were friendly. I found that if you did behave yourself in the queues you were treated with more respect. At Pirates I somehow got on the ride before the family that pushed in front on me as we were nearing the front. Quite frankly, I don't know how staff maintained their patience with most of the customers.","Neutral"
"Disneyland never gets old, no matter how old you get. :)  Before you go, you may want to download the free Disneyland Wait Times app on your smartphone to see the wait times for the rides.","Positive"
"This was a very disappointing visit. It was extremely crowded and many of the rides were shut down making the lines at the open rides interminably long. We got a fast pass for the ratatouille ride and then a second one for tower of terror. However, when we got to the front of the line for the tower the ride was shut down and there were no other rides that would give you a fast pass. So,we rode one ride for the entire day. We left before seeing the light show because there was basically nothing to do. Also, did not feel the cleanliness of the park was up to the Disney standards (trash behind the bushes at had obviously been there for weeks). Although there were designated smoking areas people were smoking wherever they wished and nobody said anything to them and there were cigarette butts everywhere. So, since we are big Disney fans we could not come to Paris and not go to Disneyland, we would not ever go back.","Neutral"
"everything about this place is perfect.  we went over Halloween and the whole park was transformed with pumpkins shaped as characters.  the haunted mansion ride was completely transformed.  brilliant.","Positive"
"The thought of disneyland makes me exciting as well as nervous. The atmosphere is great but the queues are so unattractive. We went on about 3 rides all day because we were queuing up for so long. Don't think its worth the money, over priced and the food etc expensive to buy there too. Magical for the younger children though","Neutral"
"We took our kids for a day in August. I have mobility problems. I took a letter from my Dr. to explain this and they gave me a pass for a quicker queue. This completely transformed my experience as I suffer with fatigue as well. Thank you Disney. Even though it rained a lot during the day, it didn't ruin the experience. We saw the illumination s at the band stand which is a good viewing point as it is raised and you are near the exit. The only thing that needs improving is the signs to the car park. We were completely disoriented when we came out and it took us an hour to find our car.","Positive"
"The name  Disneyland  makes you all excited about what's inside, about the facilities etc etc, however, Disneyland Hong Kong provides little to no excitement at all. It is very small for a theme park standard, it has limited number of rides and most of which are, although very child friendly, boring. The scenery however, was extraordinary. They perfectly captured the essence of every theme, some themes however, somehow gave the impression that they were minor attractions basically because there were little to no rides in them at all. Having said that, I conclude that the Tommorowland attraction is the best, especially the buzz lightyear ride, really fun, lined up thrice for that ride.","Neutral"
"I got a    It   s My Birthday    badge and I   m all happy with it. The service crew gives excellent service and try to make everything as magical for their patrons as possible. The ride that one should never miss is the Mine Ride  totally worth it. I accidentally broke a piece of glass item in the shop, when I   m about to pay for it  the crew (female) didn   t want me to pay as they knew it was a genuine accident (Shop At Hotel Hollywood).","Positive"
"I am a So Cal resident and purchased a 3 day pass. It is the cheapest way to see Disneyland without buying an Annual Pass. But if you do want to buy an annual pass you can use the money you spent toward your 3 day pass to your AP. Just use your Magic Morning FIRST and purchase AP before leaving on the 3rd Day. Save your parking ticket for refund if you buy any of the AP's that have parking included. We went on 2 16 with my great nephew who is 2 and we had a handicap person in our party. We rented a motorized scooter from Disneyland. It will cost you 70.00. At the end of the day you get 20.00 back. We had purchased our tickets online, I recommend purchasing everything online in advance to make the most of your time at Disneyland. When we got to the gate you present your ticket, you must prove you're a CA guest. They take your picture and write your name on your ticket. I had no idea that I would be asked for my ID so I had to dig for it and this held up the line, my bad!I heard someone else say that Disney retains pensioners and I believe it to be true. The cast member (was older) and she misspelled my name, crossed it off, wrote over it so much you couldn't make out my name anymore. I was concerned about this for future entry. She told me  here you write it if it bothers you that much  and then added  nothing in life is perfect . I had never been talked to so rudely at Disneyland so I was a bit shocked. With a 3 day pass you get ONE Magic Morning. It is available different days at both parks. Tues, Thurs and Saturday for D'land and the other days at CA. We got into the park at 10am and all of the characters were out on main street. Unfortunately, by the time we got to them they were taking a break. Sadly, my great nephew saw them and wanted to go up to them but couldn't. At Main Street if you're lucky to meet your character jump at the chance. But if you plan accordingly you can also go to the stationed areas where your beloved characters will be. This will help your little ones not be too disappointed. We were at Minnie's house in Toon Town. We had the handicapped person with us and we didn't know what the procedure was. I asked a cast member and she said that one person in your party had to wait in line while the handicapped person waited on the curb. When your party meets the handicapped person on the curb they can then join you in line and the house is handicapped accessible. This seemed odd to us because if a handicapped person went alone with a 2 year old he could not send the 2 year old to get in line alone. It was unclear to me how you prove you're a handicap person if you do not carry the motorized scooter key. We were asked several times to show them something. We showed them the key and we were admitted on the rides.Lastly, during off season there is no fireworks during the week. I am not sure how Disneyland can say there is an OFF season because the parks are always so crowded. Pirates, is down until after May. I am sure it has to do with the 50th anniversary of the ride. It is disappointing to go and not be able to ride. Going into the park they asked me to provide my email address so I could participate in a survey. I did. The survey wants to know how much money you spent at Disneyland and it breaks down your entire day, transportation, ticket, parking, food, souvenirs, etc. I  underestimated . I spent nearly 400.00 just for ONE person. Its expensive folks!","Neutral"
"This was my second time attending, the last one being about 10 years ago. Have to say I had sad memories of queuing in the rain with a 3 year old for Dumbo the elephant ride that lasted 2 mins and this time I got a real sense of deja vue as I was there with a 5 year old and it wasnt much better. The best advice I could give is to try and get tickets online before you go, we managed to save around 60 euro on them by booking in advance.Its heartbreaking to watch your kids want to buy merchandise that as my child said,  even if it was half the price it would still be too much. . The food is quite basic and you have to wait a long time so just be smart and bring a nice lunch with lots of snacks and drinks, you will be glad you did.No matter how nice the weather bring a raincoat as it seemed to change every hour from sunshine to rain. Wear really comfortable shoes and don't be fashion conscious.Last but not least. GET THE FAST PASS. I always thought this cost extra but it doesn't , just go to the rides and look out for the time that they issue tickets for that ride. Check that your child is over 1 metre 32 and if they are the experience is a better one. No crying kids on their tippy toes trying to convince you they are when they are only five....Enjoy it , it was good despite all that .","Positive"
"We went there really excited and in general had a good time. The problem is with the line ups. It kills the experience. Most rides are excellent but you will wait from 20 minutes even with fast pass to 50 60 minutes for regular lines. The splash mountain was great but again the line were horrible. We liked the parade as well. No time to do both parks in one day.","Neutral"
"We took an 8 hour drive down from Northern California, and stayed at a nice hotel across the way from Disney. We traveled in Early February, and were horrifiyingly shocked at the super long lines, through out both parks. We went on a Thursday Friday Saturday. Thursday and Friday were packed, but Saturday was an un godly ZOO. The lines were ridiculously LONG on all 3 days. We live near  Marine World  in Northern CA, and have never waited more than 5 minutes for any ride  EVER. Waiting 30 45 50 minutes for each ride is simply exhausting. $3.75 for a small bottle of water, and $15.00 to rent a single stroller? We thought that arriving in the off season would save us the crowds and terror. WRONG!I consulted with a park attendant who divulged that between the 2 parks, they will let in nearly 100,000 people in a (single) day!! My Husband and I both took a stroller, and spent 3 long days navigating through the  Sea of Humanity  as my Husband put it. We finally realized that in order to get the best experience you have to shell out the DOUGH. We spent $135.00 on a  lunch  at  Ariels Grotto . You have to pay a flat rate fee. It was really fun for our daughter to get personal attention from each Princess, but the childrens meals were terrible. They put dry  fishy  crackers on top of our daughters cheese shells. She did not eat a single bite. I finally gave up trying to get either child to eat any of their lunch and asked the server to bring out the desert tray. The kids gobbled down the grapes and cookies  which is the only they could stomach in the place. Also we were told that ANYONE would be happy to take a photo of us. When the  photo guy  came to deliver us a hyper inflated $29 photo of our daughter with Ariel, he ROLLED HIS EYES when we asked him to take a photo of us. REALLY!?! On Saturday it got very cold outside and we had to shell out $60 for 2 sub quality hoodies for our kids. *Note  anything in the park is going to be 4 times the usual retail price in a normal store.Bring as much food, water, and layers of clothes into the park as possible. Actually my advice would be to NOT go at all. Go to a smaller park, and you will enjoy yourselves much more!","Negative"
"The attractions are aging, the park fees keep increasing, the lines are still long, the food vendors are limited and I cannot agree that it's the happiest place on earth. The only highlights are the nightly parade of lights and fireworks show. We were there on a Tuesday to try and avoid the crowds but seems like everyone else had the same idea. We chose Oct 19th out of necessity since we had no desire to visit the park on any of the Halloween nights (which costs an extra $79 per person just for an evening session). Anyway, lesson learned.","Neutral"
"It's not so big so one day is more than enough. No scary games, and waiting in queue is long while time of playing on games is so short. Food and drinks are so expensive. The whole park's buildings and events are good and nice. The fireworks everynight is amazing.","Positive"

"Me and 3 friends went to Disneyland Paris to spend the bank holiday weekend, one of my friends has recently had to start using a wheelchair, it was her first time ever going to Disney and had always been a dream of hers. On our second day we were discusted with the treatment she received , when trying to get onto a ride the staff were rude, shouted at her, told her she was forbidden on the ride because she could not walk by herself (hence the wheelchair and the fact we used the wheelchair ramp access) and between themselves talking about her and laughing at her in French obviously not realising that most schools in England teach French. Even if you didn   t understand French the hand gestures and pointing were enough to understand. We then found one of the managers of the entire park, waited to see her she apologised but couldn   t keep a straight face and laughed on a couple of occasions to which her end statement was    what do you want me to do about it it   s done   , so much for a magical holiday destination this was my 3rd visit to Paris and I will not be returning. Discusting !!","Negative"
"We were in Paris for 8 days with our children. Most of our time was spent exploring nooks and crannies of the city or visiting the big sites like the Orsay, Sacre Coeur, and others. But on a lark we decided to try out the Paris Disneyland. Our family is from Southern California, and we've enjoyed numerous trips to Disneyland in Anaheim. We thought it would be a fun addition to an already spectacular stay. We did find ways to enjoy ourselves at the park, but it really took a lot of work. The place simply isn't up to the standard of the US parks, and our time and money would have been much better spent enjoying even more of Paris or the French countryside. I will concede that there are a few bright spots in this park: The design is a nice European update to the standard look of the US parks. The layout is very similar to the US parks, which makes navigation easy. The Space Mountain in Paris is a much better roller coaster than either of the US versions, too. My kids wanted to ride that one all day. But there were several things that just didn't sit well with us:1) Disney parks in the US are obsessive about cleanliness, order, and friendliness to families. Not so in the Paris park. First, there was cigarette smoke everywhere. I get it. We're in Europe. People still smoke a lot. But in a Disney park? Second, there was graffiti everywhere. Third, just like in the old, broken down amusement parks I used to sneak into as a kid, stairways and hallways smelled of urine. Needless to say, the smoke graffiti urine combo made waiting in lines less than pleasant.2) There simply aren't as many rides as in the US parks. The usual suspects are there  Pirates, Space Mountain, Autopia, Peter Pan. But after exhausting those, we went looking for other rides to enjoy, and there just weren't many options. The slim pickings also meant longer queues, with more folks waiting for fewer rides.3) It's suprising to say this about any establishment in France, but the food in the park just wasn't good. The candy apples and other foodstand options were mediocre, and the sit down meals were not much better. The one exception was the cotton candy stand right around the backside of the castle. It was the best cotton candy we have ever eaten anywhere. It's as if they took all the Disney magic out of the rest of the park and poured it into that cotton candy machine. Since our trip, I've spoken to a few friends who have visited the Paris Disneyland, and they all reached the same verdict: A few fun Disney bits, but a pale imitation of the real Disneyland. All of them agreed that they wished they had spent their time doing something else.","Negative"
"took my fianc   and 15 month old. got what I expected, long ques and lots of children running round. was enjoyable but was very hot and took a lot out of the little one. will be coming back when she is a little older. very expensive for everything but again it was expected.","Neutral"
"Went there for a day out with friends. Queues at the main entrance stretched because of the lack of staff available to let people in which was not ideal given it was 0 degrees outside. Rides in the main park also show their age with two that broke down while we were queuing. The Studio park is pretty good though and I would recommend it above the main park. ","Neutral"
"We went there with our 6year old kid on a Saturday, the 6th July and the experience was a big let down not just because of the long waiting time in queues but also because of the lack of thrills. We only managed to do the Big Thunder mountain, Peter Pans Flight, It's a Small World and Lightyear Lazer Buzz. Big Thunder Mountain was just about ok on the thrill meter, Small World was cute too but nothing much to write home about the rest. We didn't do the Space Mountain due to height restrictions for our child. By the time we finished these rides and a late lunch at a Mexican joint, it was time for the 7pm parade and we were sucked out of energy. The fast pass is a sham, we had 25 min waiting for the LazerBuzz even with a fast pass. I had a ten minute in the queue to collect the fast pass tickets too. The only saving grace was the Mexican lunch. Also buying the 60    premium fast pass doesn't help as fast passes cover only 9 attractions out of 50 odd! You will need a good two days to cover the park and if you are on a very short trip to Paris say three days or lesser just do not bother visiting this place. For someone like me living in Singapore, I would have managed an annual pass to the Universal Studios for the sum I spent here for a day making up for a much better overall experience.","Negative"
"I love Disneyland and have since I was a kid. My husband and I even honeymooned here over 37 years ago. Our latest trip was this month to be with some of our kids and grandkids and to see the park in it's holiday finest. I was able to experience some things in the park that I've never done before such as getting my first pair of ears and standing in line for the wristband to buy a hand pulled candy cane. Even with the rain it was worth it. I have yet to see a cast member be anything but professional and kind. Even with some were being berated because of parade traffic, not once did any cast member lose their cool. We had a great time and I'm trying to figure out when we can come visit the Mouse again! Due to knee surgery I was in a jazzy scooter on doctor's orders and not once did a cast member make me feel uncomfortable or that I was an inconvenience.","Positive"
"We got the two park combo ticket which cost over $150 per person. Parking also cost $17.A lot of the rides were stopped for half hour periods & kept breaking down presumably down to such high temperatures. We queued for over half an hour for the haunted house to get to the front & be told there were technical difficulties & to come back later   felt we wasted a lot of time & didn't get much back. As so many rides were down the ones that were running had large wait times. The park also closed earlier @ 8 on the day we went due to the halloween special. Having been to the one in Florida i felt that is better which combined with the lack of working rides probably spoilt the experience for me. ","Negative"
"We live on the east coast and have been to Disneyworld several times, mainly due to its closer proximity. We wanted to spend a day in Disneyland for comparison. Both parks have superb shuttle service and staffing. Disneyworld is much grander, with a huge castle, larger park, and many more attractions. However, there were more dining options within the Disneyland Magic Kingdom.Our main disappointment was the number of broken rides. At various times of day the following rides were down: Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Alice in Wonderland, and a few rides for younger kids. Lines at the other rides were expectedly much longer than normal.Disneyland is a special place but overall it pales in comparison to Disneyworld. If you have been the latter resort I would not waste my time going to the former.","Neutral"
"We went 12 years ago and how it has changed. It is overly expensive and and massive money making machine. Lucky to get a smile out of the staff, if you see any, apart from the performers. Not enough toilets, rides weren't working, massive queues and very few fast pass tickets available. The place was just not clean and didn't have the magic you get in the US. Restaurants cannot possibly justify the prices they charge, based on the quality and cleanliness.Top tips would be to get a good cool bag, go to the Auchan Supermarket 5 mins from Disney and get a great picnic, for 20 % of what you will pay for any of the rubbish inside.","Neutral"
"disney is disney as we all know. the lines are long and excruciating. they offer a fast pass. but be advised to research this process before thinking its going to help you out. you must plan hours ahead of when you want to go on these rides. to use the fast pass. with research it may be better.. ill take this one on operator error.. but kids had a blast of course it is still disney land.. drinks and food werent as pricy as we had prepared for so that was a nice surprise.","Neutral"
"My husband and I enjoyed HK Disney, but were surprised that there are only two high speed adult rides (and even those weren't that thrilling). Unless you are with kids, dont waste time standing in queues for Tomorrowland's go carts or Its a Small World. The parade was really great (it started at 3pm) and I loved the colourful Toy Story theme!!","Neutral"
"We had  one day two parks hopper  tickets so we visited both Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios in one day. To be honest, Walt Studios Disney is much better than this park. Some of the major rides of Disneyland Park like  Star Wars ,  Big Thunder Mountain  were closed due to some maintenance work. We visited the Disneyland Park first, used our fast pass at  Peter's Pan Flight , took some rides and left the park. When we came back to the park again as per our fast pass timings, we were informed that the ride is closed and we can use this fast pass at Indiana Jones. What? This really pissed us off. So guys if you're looking to visit only one park and confused about which park to choose, you can skip the Disneyland Park.","Neutral"

"Overpriced, lack lustre & outdated! In short you pay on average    90 Euros a person to enter a Disney shopping mall. We visited last week in June & the majority of the rides were shut. Take your own food or pay over the top for poor quality food. Another great way of making more money for Disney is the clever pricing, everything ends in either.49 or.99 if you don't have the correct change they make out they have no 1 cents so this leads you to say it's only 1 cent don't worry about the change as we & numerous others did....you work the math on how much that makes them over the day.

"Just come back from fourth visit to Eurodisney.  First time went over a weekend and it was manic!!  Second time was just a day trip whilst on holiday elsewhere in France, at Christmas time and it had a magical atmosphere.  Third time was much better, we went by Eurostar and as the kids were older we just had normal luggage (humped around by hubby!) We went Mon to Thurs and it was quieter and we had a good time  Fourth time, again we went Mon to Thurs, it was Halloween theme which they did really well. Loved the parade, we were mainly in fantasyland as my kids don't like rollercoasters and we were with my 2year old niece. We managed to get on all rides within 20mins. The tea cups, we just went and got straight back on each time. It helped that my kids have two weeks half term so we could go the week most schools hadn't broken up yet. I would advise going during term time though, if you are allowed to.Good points: We got on everything we wanted. The atmosphere was generally charming. Didn't witness as much queue barging as I have done before. Kids loved it all.Bad points:   We were spoken to really rudely by a cast member. Did you know that you can't complain about anything to Disney? They've had so many lawsuits that now they ignore all complaints! Anyway, so I just have to let that one go and not let it spoil the holiday.   expense, with the euro so strong it was even more heavy on our pockets!Eurostar only:  getting from eurostar up to the way out. Our party consisted of me, my sister and my mum plus an 8 year old, 6 year old, 2 year old and 10 week old, so a pushchair, pram and four suitcases to contend with. There was absolutely no help whatsoever in getting off the train and getting up to the concourse., it was a nightmare!!  going through security and getting back down to platform, again a nightmare. There were no luggage trolleys so again we were struggling then we had to get everything through the xray machine, including pushchairs etc. one still had a balloon tied to it! Trying to hold a baby, stop kids run amock and get coats off, remove metal items and find it all the other side was ludicrous.Anyway, nothing you can do about it, just a warning to brace yourselves!!I have given three stars because of the cast member and the fact that no one will listen to you if you just want to say what happened. I'm not sure I will go again.","Neutral"
"A visit to Disney is always a pleasure. Whilst visiting Disney just for one day make use of the fastpass opportunities and first use a fastpass at Big thunder mountain. Here the waiting time is most of the time very long. In the meantime you go e.g to Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribean and go back to big thunder mountain for usinf rhe fastpass. This is the fastest way to visit the main attractions and see the parade in one day.Disappointing elements are:1) there is still no free wifi available. In all major amusement parks in Europe nowadays a standard.2) In all guides is said that the 3G 4G connections are good as well, which is also not correct! Sending pictures is often impossible.3)Dirty washrooms with noisy airdryers. Apparently this is something which is difficult to get under control for them. Strange as there are nowadays a lot of techniques ro ensure that this is managed well.","Neutral"
"Everything is over, outrageous pricing after Disneyland profited $9 Billion in 12 months very pathetic and controlled by greed. Walt Disney created Disneyland for families with family entertainment not for outrageous profit. Most families can't afford Disneyland especially the Disneyland hotel, expensive dining, Passport admission, popcorn, snacks to say nothing of the pricing on gifts to bring home.A simple Disneyland weekend $5,000 for 2 nights in the Grand Disneyland Hotel, meals, and 2 days at the theme park. 100% absurd, and ridiculous.Over at Knotts a one year annual pass cost $145 that's 9 times less then a annual Disneyland pass.Disneyland employees are earning less the $12 an hour (POVERITY LEVEL) it's high time for a raise to $17 an hour it's called a livable wage.Affordable family entertainment has lost it's magic at  Disneyland  .Giving Disneyland a generous (1) Star  Shame on Disneyland   greedy corporate misers","Negative"

"The parks are too overcrowded which unfortunately means you spend the majority of the day in queues. You can only fit in a small number of rides a day due to the waiting time. Fast passes are not always available and even if you manage to get one there is no guarantee that it will be accepted. We tried for 2 days to get on to the ratatouille attraction without success despite having a fast pass on the day of my son's birthday and travelling back to the park at the allocated time, very disappointing. The early admission for Disney Hotel residents is a bit of a farce as the attractions are not open and queues form at the different lands. DO NOT QUEUE FOR THE OPENING OF FRONTIERLAND as it is in my opinion unsafe for children due to adults running and pushing to get ahead. The shuttle buses are also unsafe for children at busy times for the same reason. I visited here 11 years ago and in my opinion it has lost the Disney magic. The attractions would be a lot more enjoyable if we didnt have to queue for 60 minutes to enjoy them and if crowds were managed better. I'm afraid the memories I take from this visit are queuing, being pushed and squashed in crowds and being disappointed which is a shame as there is so much potential.","Negative"
"I went to Disneyland to ride in the Teacups, but they were undergoing renovation   so the sign said. Many of the restaurants were closed. The Fantasy Garden where you can usually have photos taken with all the characters was also closed. The sign said Mickey and Friends would be at The Main Street entrance for photos. Later in the day when we tried to join the line at the Main Street entrance for photos with Mickey we were told that there were enough people already so we were turned away. The line was not extensive or long by an means. The Omnibus Street vehicle was out of service. When we went to Disney's Storybook Theatre to see the 4.30 Mickey Show there was an employee holding a sign saying this show is full. I think that if you are paying $100AUD you should expect that EVERY attraction would be open and operational.A tip   buy your ticket online from the Disneyland website. You will not have to line up at the ticket booth and you will save some time. If you are a visitor to Hong Kong you will also receive a $50HK shopping voucher.","Neutral"
"Amazing! The park is great although things are very pricey it's what ou expect so if your planning a trip there get saving?!","Positive"
"Just came back from Disney Paris.   Actually it' our second time.   This time we had nice time only because of our good spirit. The rides were extremely crowded and not everything has a fast pass. Grown ups squash us when they see me with 2 small children and take our place.   In all the corners of the park and on the green areas where we lined up for the rides you see cigarettes, papers and garbage. Bees are everywhere and they chase you to death if you have a lollipop or anything sweet in your hands.   So, imagine what happens if a bee attacks my 1.5 years old baby while eating anything sweet.   The toilets are filthy.   It looks like they are cleaned only once a day when the park closes or maybe not at all.   Peter pan ride needs maintenance as at the end of the day it feels like it's boats are going to crash.   It's not the same when you ride it in the morning.   A lot of the rides were not working and we were very disappointed.   The staff in the rides are not friendly.   Maybe they were also affected by the financial crisis? They were dull, not funny, not smiley, it's like someone has cut off their salaries and work for free and they are not happy about it.   Or maybe they feel bored doing the same thing every day??!! Even some of the characters were dull and felt like they want to get over with it like  belle  whose lips were sealed and she had that  don't come near me  all over her though we were the first ones to greet her.   Maybe she didnt speak English????   Everything is extremely expensive.   The food, the toys, the gifts.   This is supposed to be a place to have fun and it's ok to spend but all over it certainly is overpriced.   It's like you are being robbed.   Imagine if you have 2 kids and they want each a costume which are priced at 60 and45 euros, you end up spending only on the costumes 105 euros without the accessories.   Not to talk about the food cause you can somehow break your child's heart and don't get them the costumes but you can't stay without food. Generally, the park is not like it was before, it needs a lot of maintenance and cleaning. Rules and regulations across the park need to be reviewed, like some priority or rules need to be set for small children so that they don't get squashed or their places taken by inconsiderate grown ups. And generally disney's concept need to be reviewed when it comes to the staff's attitude and the prices across the park.","Negative"
"Yes all the standards are there and who doesn  t love Thunder Mountain! Indiana Jones was shut for the day, then so was Thunder for quite awhile. I think Thunder is wilder in Paris! All rides are different than in the US, so it makes it fun to see something new.The low rating is not for the standard disney experience, but the park management.The bathrooms STINK. I thought I had walked into a Men  s room. Every one was the same. Some had no soap or towels. The day was not crazy busy like in the US. Most of the sidewalk vendors were closed. Lineups were standard Disney lineups, mostly because there are not as many options. The other reason for the extremely poor rating was because of the food. It was disgusting. Poor selection, poor quality and poor taste. The 500ml drink which had a 500ml mark on it was filled to 300 mls. Cost of the food was fairly standard. You can even get Turkey drumsticks. I would not make this my destination. I will not return. If you are in Paris, there is so much more to do there. Save Disney for the US.","Negative"
"Loved the magic he decs the shows it was so wonderfull our 6 year old was completely taken by surprise. Down side 28euros for a burger!! queuing for hours on end, 3 rides were closed down during visit due to technical failure, it wasn't as friendly as I thought a Disney resort might be. Great for the kids not so great for the grown ups","Neutral"
"I have just returned from a visit to Disneyland. We only spent 1 day in the park as this was enough.I took my 3 daughters, one is severely disable and uses a wheelchair, but can transfer out with support.I expected, once I had a  priority  green card that we would be able to go on rides without queuing, ie usually via the exit with potentially a short wait of up to 15 mins or so. How wrong!!! On all of the main rides that my daughter was able to get on, ALL of them had a  reservation  system in place. This meant that after going to the exit, we were told that we had to make a reservation (sometimes having to go back to the start!) and come back later. This ranged from 2 hours to 4 hours!!! We only arrived at the park after midday, and after looking around, viewing parades etc we only started to go to rides then. We were not told about this at City Hall. So when we arrived at Pirates of the Carribean at 4:50pm, we were told to come back at 8:30pm!!! I found this totally insane and hardly priority for disabled visitors. I complained at City Hall and they were unhelpful. I filled in a complaint form, and intend to write a strongly worded letter. This was our first and last visit to Disneyland Paris. I also found a lot of the staff sullen, rude and unhelpful. (Not all) It certainly was not a  magical  experience for our family and we were extremely disappointed with our visit. It was also a lot smaller than imagined and a lot if the focus was on up selling food drink and Disney stuff.The rides we did get on were frankly average and I can only imagine peoples disappointment at having to wait 1 2 hours to get on some. We went on 4 rides all day.The only real positives for us were the parades and we went back at night to see the fireworks which was good.there is more I have to say on the disability matter but would be here all day. Get your act together Disney, and make priority tickets for disabled visitors A PRIORITY!","Negative"
"I can imagine the meeting, let's recreate the fun of the American Disney parks in Europe, how can it go wrong?Well believe me it did go wrong.The rides were fine and just as I had hoped, but my goodness the organisation and attitude of the staff is appalling, the quality of the food poor (I know I'm going to pay over the odds) and availability of snacks and hot drinks awful.Don't go here if it's a prelude to visiting one of the real Disney parks in America, this is a poor imitation and is nothing like the wonderful park experience we are used too with Disney, save a little more money and delay your holiday for a while and go to a proper Disney park. (This is the exact same for the other Paris Disney park)","Neutral"
"well had a very bad day at disney as all the good rides were very crowded so didnt get a chance to sit at any ,as after sometime u feel dejected and avoid even trying to be in a line .what i saw was a peter pan show ,haunted house ,aladin place and saw the parade in the evening.if u go make sure its very imp to plan how u gonna go through each n every ride ,that saves time n energy.","Neutral"
"Just come back from our nineth visit to DLP. I can't see us goign again. Endless break downs on the rides, endless queues on the rides and far too many rides closed for refurbishment! This place is way too busy nowadays. There are not enough attractions any more despite the cost of the trip increasing by around 50% in the last 2 years. It promises so much but gives so little back to visitors. There are always a handful of rides 'closed for refurbishment' and always a couple of rides broken down. This can last between an hour or many hours. The cost of food and drink is also bordering on scandalous. A can of sprite is nearly 4 Euro's and a pint of awful beer now comes in at 7.49 Euro's! A Burger and chips wiehghs in at around 15 Euro's so it's easy to see what kind of costs you're going to come up against. I see absolutely no value in this place any more. It just isn't worth the money.","Negative"
"If you've been to the Japan Disneyland or the one in the US. you'll be disappointed with this fraction of kids entertainment. The street parade as always is the must watch.","Neutral"
"This was our third visit to Disneyland Paris having been in 2010 and 2011. I remember on our first visit in 2010 I couldn't believe how pristine it was but cannot say the same this year   unfortunately it has lost its sparkle and has become very grubby (people urinating in the caves doesn't help and it is very disappointing as one thing the park has is plenty of toilets). There used to be characters galore walking about the parks, the excitement of not knowing who you would but in to has vanished as now you have to queue to see them   and I really felt for the tiny Spiderman fan whose mum wouldn't queue for the hour! Management need re think the queuing system for rides   there should be a fast lane for children under 12. Standing in a line for 50 to 70 minutes with groups of teenagers adults in front is quite disheartening. The  fast pass  is laughable to say the least! Everyone should experience Disney but these rides are aimed at children and there should be some sort of restriction in place to let children enjoy the experience.Quite a few rides closed but the best ride was ratatouille and the new buzz light year area is great. Armageddon is a waste of time but having not done it the previous 2 visits we had to give it a go. Disney need to promote 'baby swap' as a couple behind us with a baby hadn't heard of it and it was their last day. One parent queues with older child(ren) whilst the other goes to the exit of the ride with the baby. When the parent that queues finishes the ride the other parent gets on straight away. When my son was a baby it got our daughter double rides as she was able to get on again with the second parent. We stayed in Sequoia Lodge this visit, having previously thought the Disney Hotel was a waste of money. I would love to know who gives these hotels their ratings as they are both barely 3 star, the only advantage is the location of the Disney Hotel. Security would be an issue also as on this visit to Sequoia the lady in front who had just checked in had been given key cards to a room that was still occupied   this happened to us in the Disney Hotel!Overall experience was disappointing for the money spent!","Negative"
"My husband and I don't have children, but we thought we would still at least have fun. That can't be farther from the truth. We went to Disney on Saturday, May 19th, only to find out that the park was closing early due to a  special event , which turned out to be the premier of the Pirates of the Caribbean   3. We opted to pay the $83.00 to get into Disney and California Adventure   another mistake.When we walked into Disney, there was a red carpet all down main street and people sitting around in sleeping bags, chairs, etc. and you could barely walk around. It was not possible to cross the street because of the press hoopla and the red carpet. Then, as we made our way through Disney, many different sections were closed because of the  special event'. Several of the rides were closed and the lines for those that were open were ridiculous. I went into one of the gift shops and asked the lady at the counter if it was always this busy and she said this was nothing and that typically, you can barely walk around. Ugh. We paid a regular priced admission, but did not have access to the entire park and the park closed early. Granted we don't have kids, but this experience has completely turned us off on any future Disney visits. Even if we have kids in the future, we won   t go back.","Negative"
"Try to plan a visit during the week. It will always be crowded, but we went on a Saturday and then again on a Tuesday   we noticed a very large difference. Use the fastpass system whenever possible. Don't miss the electric light parade   worth staying late. We went early in the morning, returned to our hotel for the afternoon to rest, and then went back to the park around dinner time and stayed late. This seemed to work really well with my kids and we were still able to do almost everything we wanted to at the park.","Positive"
"Perhaps the most interesting part of the visit was watching the main land Chinese tourists struggle with the concept of queuing , push you young children to the front of the queue then go find them , simply push to the front of a long queue because you had a young child, pretend to study the paining and wall paper to push your way along a corridor .Easy to get to on the MTR, ok early in the morning and again late afternoon as people appear to disappear for dinner","Neutral"
"Being season annual passholders, we take the advantage of going several times a year to get the maximum payoff of the admission fee.","Positive"
"1. Months beforehand make reservations at Blue Bayou restaurant through Disney internet site. 2. 1 day one park admission is $105 Friday, $115 Saturday, $117 Sunday, and $97 Monday Thursday, the last week of April. 3. Multiday one park admission is $210 for 2 days, $280 for 3 days, and $305 for 4 days, which I got. Once one admission is used, the next 3 admissions must be used in the next 4 days. 4. 3 and 4 day passes come with one Magic morning, where you may enter 1 hour early prior to the 8am or 9am general admission time to Fantasyland or Tomorrowland only. 5. $50 surcharge on the single or multiday passes for a park hopper ticket, where you can enter both Disneyland and California Adventure the same day.6. $10 surcharge per day per ticket for Maxpass ticket. Get fast passes on your cell phone upon availability, without physically going to that fast pass dispenser. 7. Purchase tickets on the Disney internet site, or in person at the box office on the premises. No discount Disney tickets available unless you are a park employee. 8. $20 parking at the designated parking lots a mile away. The 6 story main garage holds 10,250 vehicles. Shuttle buses to the theme park entrance. 9. Security line at the entrance. On a Monday at 830am, 10 minute line for those with bags, daypacks, strollers. 2 minute line for those without any bags. 10. You can bring food and drink, but no glass bottles, and no selfie sticks. All bags are hand searched. 11. Second line for purchase of tickets. If you have an e ticket purchased on the internet, with the scan code on your cell phone, you may skip this line. 12. There is a maximum number of visitors allowed into the park. Once that mark is reached the entry gates are closed. 13. Third line for validating entry tickets for current day. E ticket is scanned and converted into a paper ticket with an electronic bar code. 14. Facial recognition picture taken for linkage to the bar code id. No more hand stamping for re entry to park. 15. General admission is either 8am or 9am depending on day of week. On weekends they allow you to walk to the gates of Fantasyland, where there are ropes to prevent entry to the individual sections of the park.16. Once the park opens, all the teenagers run to Space Mountain and Indiana Jones in Disneyland, and Guardian of the Galaxy and Radiator Springs in California Adventure. 17. There is a stand by line and a fast pass line. On very busy rides there is a singles line, for unaccompanied riders. If you go in the singles line with a hot date, you won't sit together. 18. Fast passes allow you to skip most of the main line. Your bar code ticket is electronically tagged with the fast pass, and must be electronically validated when entering the fast pass line. The fast pass paper ticket has no electronic sensor, and is only a reminder. 19. The fast pass displays a time window when you may use it for that attraction. It displays when you may get your next fast pass, usually at least an hour after your previous fast pass.20. Space Mountain at 3pm Monday had a 90 minute standby wait, with fast passes next available for 830 930pm use that night. 21. Wife and I got fast passes to Space Mountain for 1pm 2pm. At 1pm wife went into the fast pass line. 130pm she and I exchanged bar code tickets, and she used the second fast pass. 22. If you are in the California Adventure the best restaurant is the Cove, which when I went, had a 45 minute wait at noon on a Sunday.23. Rode Big Thunder Mountain Railroad 7 times. High speed mostly outdoor roller coaster with an old west mining theme. Dual cog railway trains, with the inside train having sharper angle curves. Lot of sudden curves and drops in the dark indoor portions of the track.24. Rode Matterhorn 5 times. High speed most outdoor roller coaster, very jerky, with sharp angle curves, drops in the dark, monsters appearing at every curve in the dark. They don't have this at Disneyworld in Florida. 25. Rode Space Mountain once. High speed indoor roller coaster in the dark, with drops and sudden turns in a simulation of space travel. Closed when I was last here in 2003.26. Rode Indiana Jones 5 times. Roller coaster ride primarily in the dark, with sharp angles, hard jerks, sudden drops, culminated by almost be crushed by a giant rolling ball. Simulated poison darts, poisonous king cobra snakes, tarantulas. 27. Rode Star Tours twice, 3  D film simulation of escape on a space vehicle from a starship. 45 minutes wait in this line, the longest in my 4 days. Completely changed from when I was last at the park in 2003.28. Rode Splash Mountain once. Water roller coaster ride, riders get soaked. Called flash mountain for women displaying their boobs to the camera at the top of the 50 foot waterfall drop. 29. Rode Haunted Mansion 3 times. Indoor ride in the dark with holograms of ghostly images.30. Rode Radiator Springs 8 times. Cars racing along curves, up and down steep hills. 31. Pirates of the Carribean closed for renovations. Next time? Next time they may carry me out in a body bag!","Positive"
"We arrived with excitement and left disappointed. Four tickets at $85USD each paid for four rides each with an average wait of 45min and lasting for two minutes. And the app although helpful was not easy to navigate and the expected wait times were not always up to date. Food options were woeful. No option to sit and have just a coffee unless you bought takeaway and sat outside which in winter is not pleasant. You could sit in a restaurant only if you were to buy a meal. Diner style options were the same 4 menu options in every place. A cheeseburger with drinks, fries and an ice cream was    14.99   and you couldn   t purchase just fries or just a burger. Overall the place is amazing to look at and very clean in every respect but the details that make a trip more enjoyable like a warm place to sit and have a hot drink Having had a wonderful experience she visiting Disneyland in Los Angeles I would absolutely go there before Disneyland Paris.","Neutral"
"It was great to get there early, so that we could get on at least some rides without waiting so long. It is interesting to see how much we will pay and how long we will wait to get tossed about! It got hot and crowded as the day went on. Still the kids had fun!","Neutral"
"Just got back from disney, what a disapointment . Having been to disney in florida we had something to compare to and sadly it falls very short. The two parks can be done in a day and a half, and if it was'nt for kids go free it would of been a complete waste of money.The staff are ok but they just seem to be there for the job, There was also alot of spanish there, and what horrible people they are on holiday, lacking all manners. I even had to pull one man of the shuttle bus and make him say sorry to my 2 year old daughter for pushing her over in a rush to get on the bus. People told me the food was expensive. It is a RIP OFF!!!!!! 50euros for 2 adult hot dog, and 3 child hot dogs and chips. The hot dogs were over microwaved and the chips cold. The best bet is to take your own food or go to McDonalds. Im sad to say that McDonalds was the best food we had there. I could go on and on but I think you get the idea.","Negative"
"Plan to spend at least two days. So buy the two day pass which works out much cheaper and it gives you a 7 day gap from your first visit. You can walk and let the children have all the fun in this small Kingdom. Very good service though food and water can be expensive. But good quality shows and rides.","Positive"
"This was the better of the two parks for me.Be warned the queue can be 2 hours   for some rides. So fast pass is a must! It can mean if you plan you day use your fast pass to the max you can do a lot of the parking 12 hours. If not, you will be lucky to do 4 5 rides.These is still some magic left here, although the shops and food seem a rip off. If prices were realistic, I would be much more willing to spend money. However with rip off prices I just walk in by.I would recommend buying Disney toys in Walmart before hand and giving them to the children while at Disney so you can avoid the shops. The shops are totally not magical at those prices. However, some astonishing rides, a well lid out park and it took my breath away on a coolness scale a couple of times.TIP: Oh the queue just to get in the park can take upto 1 hour (security) Try to arrive for 8 8:30, it will save you lots of time outside and then in the actual park rides are very quiet. So use this time wisely!!!!!and selfie sticks are banned!","Positive"
"Unfortunately, this is not what it seems. Don't waste your money. Instead get the free Fast Pass for whatever time the show is that you want to watch and purchase your dinner where every you would like to eat.My family recently went on a trip to Disneyland and purchased the On the go dinning package, with the expectation that we would be  guaranteed  better viewing spot than the people who simply get the fast pass. NOT THE CASE. We arrived 30 minutes prior to the show and we were literally stuck behind a tree with all the people who got normal fast passes and didn't pay for the dinner experience. Not to mention the fact that the food was sub par. The lasagna was rubbery and the chicken was dry. You were given only 3 options and you're forced to have to pick a time that is well before the actual show time. We had a 9pm show and we had to eat our food at 2:30pm.When I addressed this matter with the  leads  they were NOT helpful nor was the manager at  City Hall  on Main Street either. I was ignored and told I would be helped and the person never came back and then when we went to main street  City Hall  the manager Ricardo was not helpful and extremely rude.From what I could see the show seemed very enjoyable but I was beyond upset that I paid for this experience and was told that I was paying for the food. NOT the case I was paying for my food and my tickets. It seems like it would be worth it if you had better spot to sit but there is no guarantee that you will see anything.AGAIN I STRESS DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!!!!","Negative"
"It was early May and many rides were closed for repair. It is great fun, as always. The crowds were not bad, as we went during the week. However, season pass holders swell the evenings, after they get off of work. There was a heat wave (100 degree weather) while we were there and Disneyland doesn't really have an answer to it, such as many misters. They did sell water bottles with fans attached. Be sure to rob your child's piggybank....it's expensive! (Worth it!)","Positive"
"We found that our day at Disney was a great family day. We took our son as we feel all kids should see Disneyland at least once in their life .","Positive"
"We had 3 days, which has is plenty to see everything.   Being Christmas time, it was packed which meant long lines and lots of waiting.  Still, worth it!","Positive"
"What has happened to the Disney magic? The park looked old and tired! The staff weren't bothered and the characters are not walking about. Food is well over priced and 4 euros for a water, come on that's to much even for a Disney theme park!!The only redeeming feature was Christmas being the theme as you walk in.Very dissatisfied and will not be going back.Save up and goto Florida it's much better.","Negative"
"I have been visiting Disneyland Paris on a regular basis since it opened in 1992 as EuroDisney, and have written separate reviews of Disneyland Paris resort in general, The Studios Park, the Disney Village, Newport Bay Club hotel, and Sequoia Lodge hotel. This review is of the Magic Kingdom park only.I last visited in August 09, for 5 days, and noticed some changes. Disney are obviously feeling the pinch of the recession, as although the parks were very busy, the parades were shorter with fewer Cast Members  dancers between each float, and there seemed to be fewer CM's around the park in general. Also the fireworks were not as impressive as we have seen in the past, which is a shame. Shows had fewer performances, and some not every day. That said, we still had a great time, and will keep going back. The park is just a short walk from the railway station and shuttle bus stops, and the Disneyland Hotel is built over the entrance. You have to go through security first. Officially, food and drink is not to be brought into the parks, but they allow some drinks and snacks within reason. (Absolutely no alcohol) There are drinking water fountains in the park, usually near the restrooms. Smoking is permitted in designated areas only.You need to pick up 2 leaflets on your way in  the Park Guide, and the Programme, which gives information and times of shows and parades, and where to meet Disney Characters in the park. They are printed in several languages. You can also pick them up at City Hall inside the park. You pass under the Railroad Station to TOWN SQUARE, with the bandstand in the middle. The lockers under the station have not been in operation since they were closed for security reasons. Bags can be left at Guest Storage for a fee. Most of the services are in Town Square, and Characters arrive at certain times. Pushchair  stroller  wheelchair rental is to the right, and you can now pay a refundable deposit to take them out of the parks to walk to the hotels. The Railroad train goes around the perimeter of the park, stopping at each of the 4 lands.MAIN STREET leads straight from Town Square, to CENTRAL PLAZA and Sleeping Beauty's Castle. You can ride on a vintage vehicle down Main Street, past the shops, restaurants and cafes. A covered arcade runs down each side of Main Street, which is handy for avoiding the crowds. There is a Good Morning Main Street Parade at 10.15 each morning. Walt's restaurant is very good, and has good views of Main Street from the upstairs windows. Plaza Gardens Restaurant has buffet meals, and a Character Tea 3pm  5.30pm. Recommend booking in advance. In front of the castle is a circular stage where you can see a show with Mickey and friends at set times. From here, Frontierland and Adventureland are to the left, Discoveryland is to the right, and Fantasyland is behind the castle.FANTASYLAND is primarily for younger children, but anyone can go on the rides. You can get here by walking through the castle doorway, and out the other side. Inside the castle you can climb stairs to the gallery, where the story of Sleeping Beauty is told in tapestries and stained glass windows. Look for the cave under the castle, where you can see the dragon!This is the busiest Land. Many of the major rides in the park have a fastpass facility, and the machines are situated near the rides. You put your park tickets into the machine one by one, and get 1 ticket per person with a time slot to come back and ride later. Check the small print as it tells you when you can get another one  it may be before your ride time, so you can get FP's for another ride.PETER PAN ride is busy. Get a FP then go on DUMBO ride, as this does not have FP. SNOW WHITE, and PINOCCHIO are similar indoor rides where you sit in carts. They can be a bit scary for small children though. LANCELOTS CAROUSEL has 86 horses. MAD HATTERS TEACUPS  you turn a wheel to choose how fast you want to spin( or not).ALICE'S LABYRINTH  Alice in Wonderland maze, with jumping water drops and the Queen of Hearts castle. IT'S A SMALL WORLD  a boat ride with 281 costumed dolls of different countries,singing the Small World song, themed on the unity of mankind. The queue moves quite quickly and this ride is better than the one in Florida, IMO. LE PAYS DE CONTES DE FEES  canal boat ride, with miniature scenes from fairy tales. CASEY JUNIOR TRAIN  small coaster circus train from Dumbo, which goes around the canal boats.Auberge de Cendrillon is a restaurant in Fantasyland where you can meet the Disney Princes and Princesses. Quite expensive, booking essential.DISCOVERYLANDSPACE MOUNTAIN  This is a roller coaster in the dark, minimum height 1m40. Fastpass available.MYSTERIES OF NAUTILUS  Captain Nemo's submarine.HONEY I SHRUNK THE AUDIENCE  3D cinema theatre show.BUZZ LIGHTYEAR LASER BLAST  very popular, get a Fastpass for this ride. Sit in moving cars firing laser guns at martians to score points.STAR TOURS  simulator ride based on Star Wars film. Fastpass available.ORBITRON  like the Dumbo ride, but with spaceships. Quite high!AUTOPIA  drive cars on a track. Very popular, no fastpass available. People start queueing for this early. 2 persons per car, so adult can go with child.VIDEOPOLIS  large theatre with stage, and fast food restaurant. Have had shows here in the past, but in August 09 were only showing Disney cartoons on a giant screen. You can watch these while you eat.ADVENTURELANDPIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN  no FP but the queue moves quite quickly, inside cave tunnels. Choose a quiet time if you are claustrophobic so you can walk straight through. Ride in a boat, with two small drops during the ride. Better than the one in Florida IMO. There is a restaurant inside the ride called the Blue Lagoon, where you can eat and watch the boats.ADVENTURE ISLE  rope suspension bridge over a waterfall, ( traditional bridge as well), caves, Swiss Family Robinson Tree House. Nice to do this at night when the lights are on, and not so busy.INDIANA JONES   TEMPLE OF PERIL  Runaway mine cart roller coaster based on the film. First 360 loop in Disney history. Went forwards when first built, then changed to backwards, now forwards again at present.There is a good buffet restaurant in Adventureland called Agrabah, with a North African  Aladdin theme.FRONTIERLANDBIG THUNDER MOUNTAIN  busiest ride here. FP available. Mine train that hurtles at high speed around and through a mountain. Pitch dark at times. Small children can go on this if they are brave enough! Better than the one in Florida IMO. Also good to ride this in the dark, and quieter when the parade is on. In August last ride entry was 11pm. We got on at the last minute with no queue. Get a FP then go toPHANTOM MANOR  haunted house with a difference. Sit in a 'doom buggy' to go round the house. May scare some small children. No FP but queue moves quite quickly.RIVERBOAT LANDING  Paddle steamers go round Thunder Mountain,and past Phantom Manor, playing peaceful music. POCAHONTAS INDIAN VILLAGE  Children's playground. Good view of Thunder Mountain from here.CHAPARRAL STAGE  shows vary from season to season. See Programme. This was 'Goofy's Summer Camp' in August, and is the theatre for Mickeys Winter Wonderland ice skating show during the Christmas celebrations.There used to be animals at Cottonwood Creek Ranch, but they were removed during the Foot and Mouth epidemic.The Lucky Nugget Saloon Character buffet lunch is very popular. Recommend booking in advance for this.PARADESCheck the Programme for times. In August the Once Upon A Dream parade was at 7.15pm and the Fantillusion Electrical parade was at 10.30pm , followed by the fireworks. Fantillusion and fireworks are not on all year round, so check before you book if this is important to you. People start to get their places an hour before, for the best views. Look at the parade route on the map, and try to be on an outer kerb so you see the floats coming towards and past you easily. We usually sit on the left side of Central Plaza, or at Town Square.There are special reserved areas for people in wheelchairs, so ask a CM to show you if this applies.DLP Fastpasses are sold on ebay, but you take a chance that they may be fakes.Useful sites are www.dlpfoodguide.com and www.dlrpmagic.comIf you have any questions, send me a message or ask on the Marne La Vallee Disney forum.","Positive"
"It has been like a family virture to make almost one visit since its opening. The park is way too small, the temperature is way too hot and the humidity is unbearable. It rained non stop most of day during our visit.The converted space mountain to Star War ride is pleasant and interesting, at least on the first ride, that is.On the otherhand the Wondrous book show is magical, a must see attraction, it added some glitters to our family tradition activity.Noticeble much less tourists, imagine it was a public holiday in both Hong Kong and Mainland China. Fast pass is useless since all attractions took less than 30 minutes waiting. For the Star War ride, by the end of the day, there was no line up. My kids and I had three rides back to back. (It was revolting to the stomach...)","Neutral"
"Disneyland is the best. Even with such large crowds over New Years, it was really well managed. The rides are fun, the characters engaging, and the place is so clean, tidy and fresh.  Everyone should visit at least once in their life!!","Positive"
"We have just returned from Euro Disney, we stayed at the Davey Crochet Ranch. 2 adults 3 children, overall we had a great time, cabin was clean easy to find and comfortable the kids loved it ,all the staff we saw were helpful and smiley and all in character which added to the magic. The Disney Dreams show was amazing (although was very late at night our 2 youngest were asleep and needed waking up). Down side lots of queuing(was expected as went in August), lots of walking, and No Merrida! My daughter's love this fisty princess and after queuing to meet the princesses for an awful long time we found out there is no Merrida only the usual princesses, very sad.I asked at the town hall if Merrida was here but unfortunately didn't get the answer I wanted, I had very unhappy little girls not been Mickey could Christensen up :( other than that Disney was wonderful :)","Positive"
"I know in the future they will expand, but for now, it seems awfully small.  I got there at 10 AM, and people were leaving at 1:30, right after the parade.  There just aren't enough rides attractions open yet... and some of the real classic attractions...More","Neutral"
"Only down falls not enough sitting area, shaded areas and drinks are very expensive. (Day was extremely hot.) Tuesday seemed to be an excellent day as we never waited longer than 10 min for anything.","Positive"
"Went there and it was SLIGHTLY drizzling. It was signal number 3 (this was posted but no further details or notes added). Upon paying and entering we found out that NO outdoor rides would open that they and at around 12NN they announced that the fireworks is cancelled. We went home at around 1PM and saw that the line was still long at the entrance, the customers had no idea that Disneyland rides were not to be used that day.A sign outside along the signal number 3 should have been put. What a waste of HK549 and HK109 (food). I went to HK for this.","Negative"
"My family had never had as much fun as when we visit Disneyland Park. It is just like being a little kid again. I recommend getting there as soon as the park opens to help avoid lines. Also this time we used the Disney Max Pass app. It was $10 per person per day but it was worth it. We hardly waited in any lines at all. And instead of running across the park to get fast passes we could do it on our phones. It was really easy. It was also really hot the day we went so we had Dole Whips in the Tiki room and it was a great way to cool off. It was a magical experience. I can't wait to do it again.","Positive"
"We were lucky that it was not overly busy but there were still some queues of over 30 minutes but we did not use the fasttrack facility because the available timings were not right. However, it really is a fantastic time especially for children under 9 (height restrictions excepted for certain rides) and with the sectioning out of the park, planninng what you wanted to do and when was important. The Dream Parade seemed to be smaller than the previous time we visited and there were a number of  rides  and restaurants that were not open when we were there. Was really glad of the early opening facility that you get when staying at a Disney hotel so we were able to do some of the popular rides early although it also meant that the photo opportunity was not available as the booth does not open until the true opening time.","Positive"
"The pink mythical castle certainly gets your attention. Nothing short of a fairy tale. Obviously, it   s a kid   s paradise, so not much for adults. There are a few really good rides for adults though, choose wisely. Almost all the good rides have 30 45 min wait. You can shell out some extra money and get a fast pass, much quicker. We were all adults, so easily finished both parks.Get the ticket which has the one day two park option. Buy it online to save time at the venue. On a good day, the crowd is overwhelming. You can use the trains to get there (RER) pretty straight forward and it goes right up to the gate.","Neutral"
"I booked tickets for myself and a friend for a weekend in January. Mistakenly I booked for Sunday. I called in advance to request this be changed (a simple process at the tourism company I used to work for) and this now seems but impossible as their system won't allow it. After waiting on hold for an hour I thought to compensate, I wanted my tickets cancelled and refunded, apparently this is not plausible either. Extremely unsatisfied with this service.","Negative"
"This one sucks compared to the Ocean Peak. The park has very little to see. We spent like 4 hours in the park and already see everything we are interested in. If you have been the Disney World in Orlando then you can safely skip this one.","Negative"
"Today is my weekend ..Lucky my friend have free ticket to bring me and my lover to disneyland,My third go to disneyland, It is also many mainland people~~I am stay here for 4 hours and go outBecause i am not interest disneyland character and i feel bored","Neutral"
"I have been to Disneyland 3 times. I probably won't go back until I have an 8 year old kid (currently childless, so...not for a long time). The park doesn't care about overcrowding and the ridiculous amount of strollers. They want your $100  for the day, and don't care about line wait times, or park capacity. 3 of the main attractions were closed, which was a bummer. It's just too pricey for two people to spend a day waiting in line for 4   5 rides. What's the point? Knotts Berry Farm and Universal Studios are 100x better, and have half the issues (and are more economical).","Neutral"
"We had a great time here, using fast pass to skip queues was great when the rides were working or it was available. Food needs to be improved. A decent deli could make a fortune as most lunch outlets are terrible. Family of 4 expect to spend    50 a day on lunch.","Positive"
"Went here after trip across the USA. Having visited Disney world in Florida we were very disappointed with this park in relation to Florida.About a quarter of the size, and the castle is tiny, hence very packed expensive and limited rides and attractions. Only spent 7 hours there as there were not enough interesting things to do.Don't waste the time and money....Spend the airfare and get the full experience.","Negative"
"If you are visiting Paris and like Disney production, visit to this park is a must. I get way it's a dream place for children, but you definitely need to brace yourself to queue for long time, move extremely slowly due to overcrowding and pay a lot of money for pretty much everything... Aside this though, they still managed to create  a Disney paradise  where you can easily have a great time.","Neutral"
"We visited Disneyland in Paris on the 4 June 2006 and was very disappointed. Paying to get in to the park was easy and there were plenty of cashiers to help you paying the fee for the park (no lines here)Once inside came the bitter truth of the magic, the place was packed with people and the favouirite attarcation pirates of the carribian was closed and no warning of this at the ticket office. But we could live with that, but then came the shock the fastest line to find was Peter Pan at 50 minutes. All the other main attractions were up to 100 minutes to wait for. So we were able to try 5 attractions including the boring Nautilus submarine so I should say we got to try 4 attractions for 121 Euros. I guess you can understand the disappontment our son showed (6 years).What did we do to try to improve our situation then!We tryed to get fast passes, all gone!We asked for advice on how to save the day and get some magic at the information, advice given was to skip the parade and go to Peter Pan instead, people will start getting home at 1700 to 1800 Hrs then it will get better, it did at 1930 Hrs and then the attractions was closed!The food in the park is overpriced to say the least, a hot dog is 4,7 Euros and picknick is forbidden.As the attractions are fantastic our recommendations must be1 Do not visit the park in high season as it is a rip off for what you get during this time2 Be french and try some civil resistance and have a picknick iniside the park and see the arrest of your family as an attraction as they are very difficult to try anyhow. I am sure the sight of Mickey stopping your family eating will aruse the french around you and thus helping you avoid the hot dogs for 4,7 Euros3 Try helping us in saying to Disneyland Paris that they should do as at the Eiffel tower does and that is to candidly state the waiting time to see the top before you pay as it is important to give children the right expectations!","Negative"
"Not much people since it's a working day. Staff are mostly friendly although it's a bummer that we don't get a table at the pirates of the carribean cove. That will have capped off a wonderful day. Apparently they don't accept walk in.The size is not terribly bigger than the HK disneyla v:nd so I don't think it's worthwhile to travel thousands of miles to check out this theme park but it's a good layover stop for a road trip.The finale on a weekday was the parade at 7pm. It carries a lot more comtemporary characters than HK version but the ending is less fairytale like and is less punchier. ","Neutral"
"Having spent four days here, the most excruciating thing is the amount of time wastes queuing with young children (3,4 and 6). One queued to meet characters as they spring up around the park, queue to go on rides that always underestimated the waiting time, queue for a painfully long time to get a meal or snack, and queue to enter the premises   security and tickets. Although we managed to take in many of the rides, features and entertainment on offer, we were left feeling exhausted at the end of each day which marred the experience for our children as we were so fractious by the end of the day! The only thing you needn't queue for is the shops. There are tons of them and what I found inexcusable is the fact that they Jack UP the prices on site. A princess dress will set you back up to    70. The UK disney stores are cheaper. Shouldn't it be that in Disneyland they ought to cost less?There are too many people entering the grounds. Disney is a greedy, corporate machine and we shall not be retiring to Disneyland Paris anytime soon. Tips: 1) take empty refillable bottles and some squash.2) get food elsewhere if you can. It's expensive, slow and not great quality on site. 3) get your kids something from your local disney store first. You'll save at least 1 3 off the price of items on site. 4) go to America.","Negative"
"If you have already been to Disney in L.A. and Tokyo, I would suggest you skip Disney HK. The park is big but the rides are limited. And there's also no ample shelter and sitting area for visitors who would like to take a rest from all the queuing and walking. Just remember to bring an umbrella and slab on lots of sunblock if you are visiting the park in the summer.We bought a 2 day pass but felt that a 1 day one would be more than sufficient.","Negative"
"Just finished 2.5 days at Disneyland Paris and was very disappointed. The prices are shockingly high the wait times for rides was ridiculous. All the big rides had more than 60 minutes of waiting. To me this trip solidified that Disney only cares about the bottom line as they clearly had too many people in the park and were unable to accommodate. I am actually ok with the high prices as I honestly expected to pay extra for the experience. What is unacceptable is the waiting for everything..as other guests mentioned you literally cue for everything. The only way to see everything is to stay for an entire week because you will literally be in line the entire time. Seems like numbers through the door are far more important than quality of experience. We are done with Disney. ","Negative"
"We booked our skip the line tickets online, and that served us well, as queues were horrendous. Our son is 12, so a bit too old for Mickey Mouse, and so he was interested mainly in the Star Wars attractions, of which the schedule and website (checked in advance, of course) assured us that there were plenty to choose for: some kind of show, some kind of Star Trooper training academy, a ride in the Millennium Falcon, and so forth... In short, a 12 year old SW fan's dream day. Well, first of all, we had troubles locating anything on the premises, due to an appalling lack of sign posts. In Florida, everything is signposted, re signposted, and re re signposted; in Paris, you've got to blunder :  Worst still, whenever we asked the staff, we were given conflicting   not to mention, erroneous   answers (so, basically, we were sent in the wrong places and made to blunder some more). Eventually, we found that the show had been cancelled due to poor numbers of attendees, the so called Star Trooper Academy was a glorified food court slash movie theater, and so on. A real disappointment.Of course, the gift shop was well stocked, and we ended up scrambling to save the day for our boy by buying him a load of stuff he didn't really want.Oh, and just FYI, all through this wonderful debacle, it rained cats and dogs. So, bah humbug as far as I'm concerned.","Neutral"
"We have always gone to Disney World in the past but decided to go to Disneyland this year. The park was very similar to the Magic Kingdom in regards to the layout and the rides, just a little less spacious than the Magic Kingdom. The kids loved the rides and had a great time meeting some of the characters. We went in the middle of June which we assumed it would be crowded, and it was. Best tip we could offer would be to get there early when the lines are short and the temperatures are cooler. Overall, we had a great experience and will visit again.","Positive"
"This is my fourth trip since Cars Land opened and it is best done at night. It is beautiful and the engineering is fabulous. Well worth the family time. We won! I Do miss Luigi's balls in while riding in the tires. Great time and yes we moved on to Grizzly River Run for a real soaking time. Laughed so hard. Of course did both Parks and spent 4 days. More to come.","Positive"
"I have been to disneyworld in the USA before, I didn't expect Paris to live up to the USA but I was slightly disappointed. The rides were good, but only managed to get around 5 rides in a day due to the queues! I expected queues as it is a theme park, but there was no control over people pushing in front etc which agitated me and my other half a lot when we had been waiting a good hour. It was a shame not to see any characters roaming the park! I knew Micky would be in his house but outside only saw pooh bear! Which was a shame. The place it's self is beautiful and I couldn't stop taking pictures. The food was very disappointing and the price very high. It was an average experience","Neutral"
"I am embarrassed that Disney paris is affiliated with American Disney parks. We had a brochure from our hotel for a rate 20 some euros cheaper than a days pass, but was told this rate can only be used online and you have to wait 24 hours to use the pass once bought...so we had no choice than to pay gate prices only to find more than 1 2 of attractions for adults closed for refurbishing! we were done with the entire park withen 3 hours! I went to guest relations to complain, they wouldn't extend free admission for the other park that same day but for the next day, we were leaving, they don't offer refunds of any kind, nor would they extend a disney gift card we could use in the USA but they offered us 4 soft drinks...for over 250 euros spent it was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. I would stay away unless you have small children that will enjoy playing in the playground areas and the maze and small rides.","Negative"
"My first and last trip to Disneyland. My family and I are Walt Disney World travelers 10 years plus staying there at their best locations (Contemporary, Grand Floridian, Wilderness Lodge and the Polynesian) over the past 10 years. We never experienced anything negative at Walt Disney World. We expected the same for Disneyland. We found the parks to be dirty, cast members to be rude, crowds in the park, not really family oriented and scary looking, tons of tattoos and piercing everywhere. We asked Disneyland's help when we encountered a drug deal going on at our Disneyland approved property and was hung up on and told off. This was just not one person. We ran into about 7 cast members who were rude not just on the phone but also in the parks. Not really the happiest place on Earth. They are very unhelpful, and if you are handicap, their new attractions were made handicap accessible for people only with mobility problems only. If you have a handicap person who is unable to wait on long lines, due to other medical issues, too bad! your handicap medical pass gets you no where! Their only solution is for your parties to separate and call you when they are ready to go in. In addition, we were threatened on one of their Disney approved properties and they upgraded to a dump   took pictures to prove it. Just all around rude people and not worth traveling west for. My advice is go to Walt Disney World if you are able. The workers are nicer, family friendly, cleaner and the resorts are top rated.","Negative"
"Great family park with the classic Disney quality and service at its best. Recommend more than the Orlando park if you travel with small children.","Positive"
"We waited for almost 2 hours for tickets, there were only 4 people serving. We then waited in another queue to enter the park. A few of the big rides were closed. Lines for rides were well over an he, people everywhere. Food is average and overpriced. Was a good day out if you're a bit Disney obsessed, but probably wouldn't go back again!","Neutral"
"I enjoyed Tokyo Disney Sea and Tokyo Disneyland much more than in Hong Kong. The food in the Flavours of the Orient restaurant however, was outstanding and the best I've had in any theme park ever!The rides were enjoyable and as it was a Tuesday, there was not a large crowd. All in all, it was nice and there were the usual Disney things to see and do, however it was just a little bland.","Neutral"
"We visited with a 6 year old granddaughter who totally loved every minute even though the weather was wet and cold. 15 19 dec the queues we still big and it was hard to get your photo taken with the characters. The food was a bit repetitive as its all burger and chips and not much else. Wasn't happy with people smoking in the queues and the French seem to think they do not have to wait and try to push in. We stayed bed and breakfast in the Sequoa Lodge which was fine the only downside was the swimming pool which was small, cold and the changing rooms were not adequate. I was a little put off in Main Street when I saw a cockroach running along a food counter. Worth another visit.","Positive"
"I don't think you have ever lived unless you visit Disneyland. You must watch the parade and the fireworks display.","Positive"
"We've been to the park twice. We like a handful of the rides and it's fun to walk around and see everything. Some of the food is amazing, but I could not get past the thought of how much money I had spent to be there.... for one day. I can get my daughter and I two day tickets to another theme park where we have tons of rides we enjoy for about the price of ONE Disney ticket. It is a fun experience but extremely overpriced, in my opinion.","Neutral"
"We are regular visitors at Disney World, so thought we'd give Disneyland a try. While it was fun, it was just not the same Disney service that we are used to. It felt like a really nice Six Flags. They did have a great variety of rides, but no shows. The weekdays were not too busy, and we could relax and enjoy ourselves, but come Friday about 5:00, watch out all of the locals came and it was jam packed all Friday evening and all day Saturday!! We've never seen crowds like we experienced at Disneyland.The line for Dole Whip looked like it was a Mile long! For true Disney fun head to Florida!","Positive"
"This is a nice trip for families as it has all of the disney magic and atmosphere as the other parks but not quite as many people. the focus is more on the characters than the rides. A nice attraction if your expectations aren't too high.","Neutral"
"One day pass is not enough because you will spend at least 50 minutes minimum for queuing on each ride. The park is full packed and we even went there during the weekdays. There are so many rides available for all ages. Many shops and places to eat but of course everywhere is busy.","Positive"
"It doesn't compare to the huge parks in the US but it's easy to get to, fun, lots of characters, enjoyable day out, worth a visit! Not too crowded and queues for rides weren't long","Positive"
"Unfortunately our experience to Disney was not as good as some. We travelled with two children, the younger one being a huge disney fan. The queues were very long, which really was no problem, the rides very short. There was not a single Disney character walking around. We were hoping at least to see one. Only one restaurant was open for lunch, (other small snack area's open) over an hour in queue just to place our order. Still we were not discouraged  we were at Disney  and our children did enjoy themselves, but for me very overpriced for what you get!","Neutral"
"The site is undergoing a lot of remedial works to bring the park park back to the original glory  Having been here in it hay day, this visit was very disappointing.  The staff were very attentive, although the park let the park down.","Neutral"
"First visit to Disneyland, although I have been to Disney world several times. We were there the week of Nov 14th, so the park was dressed for Christmas. It made everything even more magical. Because it was the week before a holiday the lines were non existent and the weather was perfect. While Disneyland is much smaller than Disney World, it has a certain quaintness that the larger park just cannot accomplish. Money CAN buy happiness, it's called a ticket to Disneyland.","Positive"

"having been to california and florida many times we kind of thought we knew what to expect.....how wrong we were! the staff where appauling, rude and innatentive, a very laissez faire attitude to the paying customers and boy did we pay! i cant remember being anywhere this expensive over 3 euros for a coke and about the same for water. on the plus side the weather was good! The worst point about the park and i cant blame disney for this was just how rude the french guests were, they have never heard of queuing and the fight to get to the front was beyond belief and the the fact they do not care makes it even worse. I'm an ex rugby player but viewing parades was akin to some of the toughest scrums ive ever been in. the park staff just stood and watched like it was a sport of some kindon a number of occaisions we heard the park staff muttering under there breath, and in general it was the older park staff, not the younger ones. luckily i do speak some french which proved invaluable as there was a real reticence to engage with customers. My top tip is dont go, save up a bit and go to florida or california where the experience is so much better and will leave happy lasting memories whereas disneyland paris left a bad taste and an empty bank account!","Negative"
"Not worth it even with the fastpass. I was a little dissapointed. Disney always does amazing things but this show is anything but. Unless you like watching clips of cartoons on water with a little fire here and there. You would think they would try to one up Fantasmic. I will never waste my time again.","Negative"
"the whole DLP thingy is getting old now, we have visited before (3 times ) but we took our grandson who is only 2 as it was his birthday, very very disappointed this time, if it not being refurbished its got technical problems, this happened to us several times whilst we was there, you would think the prices they charge for entry and merchandise there would be more investment !!!the place was rammed with people kids moaning about waiting for rides, how do you expect toddlers to stand in line for 2 hours in the hot sun (with no shading) c`mon DLP SORT YOURSELVES OUT )we even witnessed queue jumping several times and staff just turning a blind eye until 1 dad grabbed another dad by the throat and pushed him and his family right back out again (good for you mate )all these problems need to be sorted soon,","Negative"
"Thoroughly enjoyed our 2 days at Disneyland.Not sure why but we didn't need to queue long for anything. We visited on the 8th and 10th of September and the most we had to wait was one go round per ride.I would suggest the 2 day pass if traveling with younger children so they can enjoy at their pace. There is also stroller rental available which helps when the little legs get tired.","Positive"
"You can absolutely spend a full day or even multiple days if you   re a Disney enthusiast. However, a half day in either the morning or afternoon is worthwhile, like we are happy proud annual pass holders, we go there every week for three years and we still enjoy everytime there. And whenever we have friends coming with their kids we always love to meet there and we love our Instagram meetUp with HK followers or even overseas one, it's Truly magical. They do a good job of outlining where and at what time the characters will be out greeting. Characters commonly sign autograph books, which you can buy in the Emporium on Main Street. It is a nice souvenir for your kids to have. They can put the stickers staff around the park will give them in this book, too.","Positive"
"Had a long weekend in Paris and thought a day out to Disneyland would be a perfect addition to our trip, however at the end of the day we wished we had stayed in the city for the day instead! Very expensive to get there on the train, then very very expensive to get in so already feeling a bit negative, so we went to get some food from the little pizza restaurant in 'fantasyland.' The food was horrible. It was over cooked and tasted awful, and we paid    25ish for 2 small, rubbery meals. Used some nearby restrooms as well, and these were some of the most disgusting toilets i have ever been in! Had to use multiple toilet seat covers, and when needed again, I just waited to use the much nicer toilets on the train on the way home, and I don't often find train toilets preferable to anywhere!We then decided to queue for some rides, however not once but twice were we suddenly ushered out of queues along with everyone else by grumpy, rude workers who upon questioning revealed that the rides had broken down and our 30 minutes of queuing had been for absolutely nothing. We found ourselves thinking that if they can't manage to keep the rides working in the winter, then why keep the park open and charge extortionate prices? We wasted well over an hour queuing for these 2 rides that we never got to go on, and there was no apology or explanation from the staff unless pressed. Felt a lot like a waste of money and will not be going again, and would advise people to really think twice about whether they can face the queuing, because even if you queue for a long time there is no guarantee you'll get on the ride, as they can't seem to keep them operational!","Negative"
"Have been to Disney in the states and was a little disappointed. We stayed in a Disney Hotel (Newport Bay). I need to mention the supposed extra 2 hours from 8am to 10pm at the Disney park. This was a joke, we were given the attractions which would be open, very few and 2 of the areas Frontierland and Adventure land were not open at all. On arrival we, and the rest of the Disney Hotel guests were treated to approx half of the very few that were supposed to be open, with sorry we are not opening till 10am. This resulted in massive queues even before 10am.","Neutral"
"Disneyland is one of those places where every time you go it's different. In my case, I was born and raised in Southern California, so I've been at least once a year and it's always a good time. We've hit a point where we don't feel a need to make it on every ride. We go where our mood takes us, and don't kill ourselves to stand 2 hours in line for a ride. Honestly, I can't remember the last time I waited over an hour for a ride. Disneyland (and California Adventure) changed their fastpass policy sometime in the last two years, in my opinion for the worse. As an engineer, I understand why they now strictly enforce their fastpass times, but as a guest, I hate it. When you get a fastpass for any ride, you now must come back within the window (there may be a grace period after, I know there is in Florida) or you lose out on that pass. It sucks, and it makes for more planning in any given trip (especially when you hop between parks). Fastpasses are still an absolute MUST, just make sure you can actually go during the time you get. They are free though, so if you miss your window, it's not the end of the world. Based on my tens of times there, these are my recommendations: Rides:   Space Mountain     mandatory  Buzz Lightyear     great for kids and competitive people  Splash Mountain     if you have time to dry before it's cold. If not, talk your friends family kids out of it. I have actually had to buy clothes before because I was too soaked and didn't dry before I froze.  Canoes     physical exercise to justify whatever you eat next   Matterhorn     fun fact   the last park employee i spoke with said they still call the monster Harold  Storybook Boats     I am the only one in my family that loves this ride, but I think it's awesome. You get to sit for 10 minutes and look at adorable small villages   Indiana Jones     Prepare to be jostled  Big Thunder Mountain     surprisingly really fun if you're riding while the fireworks are going off Note: all of the rides are really pretty great, but these are a few that I for sure recommend Restaurants:   Plaza Cafe     I love the pot roast, and if you go late enough in the evening, just camp out and watch the fireworks from a cozy table with a cup of coffee. Such a nice way to enjoy the show  Mexican restaurant in Frontierland     Still don't know the name of this place, but it's been a Mexican restaurant with different names for as long as I can remember. Great for lunch or dinner.   Blue Bayou     Expensive, but treat yourself at least once. If the waiter doesn't point it out, make sure to stare at the tree and look for the  shooting star  on the roof The other restaurants are fine too, but these are my favs. Several of the others are basically overpriced burgers, pizza and chicken sandwiches. I've been on dates, with friends, with my family, and with extended family. It's great always, but best enjoyed with people that are going to enjoy it just as much as you.","Positive"

"Growing up in Florida, you can understand that we are Disney fanatics. If there is a Disney nearby, we will visit it. We've visited the Magic Kingdom in Florida over 100 times, Disneyland Paris in Europe, and now, of course, Disneyland in California. There are two parks, Disneyland and California Adventure, and many of the rides from the Orlando parks are found here. We absolutely loved the fact that they still have Mr. Toad's Wild Ride; that was removed from Orlando decades ago and it used to be one of our favorites (totally hokey). This place has the usual Disney charm and service. We really enjoyed it. However, the underwhelming part is that you walk right up to the park and see a tiny Sleeping Beauty castle versus taking the monorail into the Magic Kingdom and seeing Cinderell'as beautiful castle coming over the horizon.Totally worth the wait....Space Mountain, Soar, Tower of Terror, Indiana Jones, Buzz Lightyear, Radiator Springs RacersNot worth the wait, especially with teenage kids...Roger Rabbit Crazy Cars, Matterhorn, Luigi's Flying TiresEverything else had pretty reasonable lines despite the fact that it was a holiday weekend.","Positive"
"Too many people from mainland China didn't follow the queue and it was very crowded. But the services and staff were nice, willing to help me on some directions and answered me politely. Only the problem is a bit small and too crowded. It is not worth to that expensive tickets. The MTR to there was cute and nice.","Neutral"
"August 4, 2005Hello I am a single mom (widow). I have one son, (married with an 8 year old son of his own) and two teenage girls. My children wanted to go to Magic Mountain, but I suggested Disneyland. Since I wasn't sure if my grandson could go on most of the rides at the other theme park. And I used to love Disneyland. Big mistake on my part. Let me start with admission prices,  way overpriced  I paid $438.00 for 7 adults and 1 child. My daughters took 2 friends. Over $250.00 on just snacks, bottled waters, and dinner.And that does not include the money that my son and his wife spent. I couln't even afford to get my kids a souvenir this year. But that is not the worst of it. We spent most of our day waiting in line. There should be some kind of limit on how many people are allowed into the park. I know the Disney Corp. really doesn't care. All they are concerned about is raking in the money. They do not care how miserable people are spending most of their day waiting in lines, for snacks attractions, rides, food, and even the restroom. Well I was very disappointed this year. It will be a long time if ever before we go back to Disneyland. It just keeps getting worse every year. More expensive, too many people. I am sorry but it was not the happiest place on earth for myself and my children.","Negative"
"Went to Disneyland Paris for kids age 12,10,9.Glad I bought 2 park ticket cos main park not wild enough for my thrill seekers all day.They loved the rock and Roll Coaster and Stunt show at The Studios.Main park tired,jaded.Not as clean and enticing as florida.My kids not as up to date on all disney characters as we were as kids so no idea who half of them were.Disney doesnt promote on normal freeview channels that we have so are missing a trick in enticing new generation I reckon.Rides ok.Luckily we were there first week of easter hols.(I had checked when all other european kids had their school hols...they were the easter week.So queues not so bad.Took snacks and drinks in but had to buy burger and chips for kids ....  60 for 2 adults 3 kids....AAAArgh Rip off. Cant even say it was nice....Will we go back ...No.Kids prefer Alton towers ,more thrills.I appreciate it may be great for younger kids but paying full price for entry is too expensive now in recession times.We only go to theme parks in uk on 2 for 1's,blue peter badges etc .  200 for a day out for a family is extortionate.However ,ticked that box........","Neutral"
"We were scheduled to spend only one day in Disneyland, but we came back the very next day because my daughter wanted to explore more. You cant practically cover it in one day. Its overwhelming !The parade is fantastic, the fireworks too !! There is so much to see. It's a bit expensive to shop, but even more to purchase picture ! But its worth it. Its worth paying for every picture which shows a smiling child with twinkling eyes looking at the wonders of Disneyland.We met Elsa & Anna   frankly the only reason we even went all the way to Disneyland for !! For my five year old, it was a dream come true. She interacted with them for a good 10 minutes got pictures clicked and wouldn't leave Elsa's hand in any of the pictures :) She even told Elsa,   Anna secretly has a boyfriend call Hans  :) The pooh ride   we did it 4 times, the mystic manor was fun, the small world was unexpectedly very entertaining, the Toyland   caught my little one's fancy (slinky dog) , pixie hollow , Tomorrowland ( i tricked my kid to take a roller coaster ride   i am still receiving punches...ouch) so many more rides cant remember them all .Inspite of heavy rains on both the days, we thoroughly enjoyed our viist to Disneyland. It was worth it meeting Mickey, Minnie, Pooh, Goofy, Pluto, Elsa, Anna ....When it was raining heavily I left my daughter under a shed and ran across to fetch her stroller from the parking, a park staff came running with an umbrella to help me while another rushed to my daughter to ask if she was okay or had lost her way. He walked her to the stroller parking under his umbrella.And receiving those stickers from the Disneyland staff, was my daughters priced collection throughout the trip. These small but very thoughtful gestures won our heart !The Cotton candy tubs, the caramel pop corn. chocolates ice creams and the soda's really made Disneyland a must must must must visit when your child turns FIVE !!!!!Its the best vacation you can give a five year old ! We will re visit soon :)","Positive"
"I hate everything about this place, which sucks cause growing up I loved it. My last experience will most definitely keep me from ever coming back.","Negative"
"Paris Disney staff seem to have forgotten it's the happiest place on earth. Few ever cracked a smile or said hello in the three days we (me, husband and 3 kids aged 9,7 and 7) where there  they need to pick up their game. The park is lovely to look at and the rides are much the same as the other Disney parks of course, but the magic is definitely missing. Almost every ride we went on broke down at some point and the queues were crazy, much longer than they ought to be mainly due to staff not loading boats cars properly and letting some go a quarter full   ridiculous and frustrating. Meeting the characters at the park is almost impossible, unless you organise yourself with military precision   which I suggest you do. Find out where the characters are going to be and map put your day accordingly. The biggest disappointment was meeting a Princess at the Princess pavilion. You must start queuing at around 10am to reserve a spot to see one. After waiting in line for an hour, you'll be given a window of time to go back. That's when they tell you you can't choose a princess and you get who you get which is fine, I guess. When you return for your window   expect to wait in line again for another hour and a half. And what do you get at the end of all that? Two minutes with CInderella (or whoever). She says hello, poses for a photo and that's it! 2 minutes!! You get longer with the characters at dinner in the Disneyland Hotel. Also NO FROZEN PRINCESSES! The biggest grossing Disney movie of all time that has every little girl I know wanting to be Elsa or Anna  but neither of them is in sight. There's a Frozen float in the parade   so they have the actors and the costumes  how hard could it be to wheel them out??!! This is a major stuff up on Disneyland's part. Frozen merchandise was also hard to find, with desperate mums seen searching high and low in vain for an Elsa costume or an Olaf or Sven plush toy The saving graces  the parade (always a winner) and the light show fireworks   but expect to stay up late, it doesn't start until 11pm. The food is extremely average, like most theme park food, and the queues for even a coffee or water or outrageous. Staff are slow and inefficient. I recommend eating at Hakuna Matata in Adventure Land before 1pm. It has decent kids meals. Overall, I would take any US Disneyland over this one any day. At least the queues come with a smile.","Negative"
"Had the best time at Disneyland Paris, the set up is to magical and amazing. We went at a quiet time, so there were barely any queues for the rides (15 minutes max) however this does also mean that some of the rides were closed for maintenance and not all restaurants open during the quiet periods. We did expect this and made sure we enjoyed what was available within the park to the fullest. I would liked to have seen more characters walking about but I can understand that there's not much point when there's barely any kids there. I think many of the negative reviews come from people being unprepared for the prices and the time of year they go. Most of the rides were amazing, as well as all the available food and the parade. I personally would do anything to go back and live there and be like big kids with no worries.","Positive"
"The park is so small, with so few people and performances that it is almost depressing. There are no new rides there either so if you are a long time Disney person you won't find anything new or exciting. You will be much more pleased with Shanghai Disney which is only a short two hour flight away.","Negative"
"It could be really nice, but I couldn't stand the que, too large, wait sometimes more than one hour for 5 minutes fun. I am too old for this...","Neutral"
"This is our 2nd disneyland visit and the rides were good. We used the fastpass option wherever available and it helped to shorten the waiting time. Lot of the rides were closed during our visit but it provided the needed fun for the whole family.","Positive"
"Grime, mold, garbage, general decay and lack of the Disney    shine.    Rides were not just smaller and different, but uninspired and in desperate need of upkeep. For instance, the Indiana Jones ride was simply a carnival roller coaster built around an aging, molding temple badly in need of a cleaning. People smoked everywhere, which made standing in line a whole different experience. There was mold on the park signs, too, which I   m sure would have horrified Walt. Not good. If you   ve been to Disneyland or Disney World, don   t bother with Paris     just go to the Louvre instead and save yourself a disappointing experience.","Negative"
"Booked a southern California visitors pass, so had 3 day's to spend in Disney. Going in October the park is celebrating Halloween so have special night were guest for a little extra cost get to dress up in costumes and get to celebrate Halloween Disney style with firework shows. Great for adults and children and not at busy as Florida.","Positive"
"Although Disneyland is favored by people from all over the world, however I'm pretty upset, and I'm sure I'm not the only one, on the admission prices just to get into the park itself, 75 , that just does not seem reasonable for those who have more than two children...I still love  It's a small world  and the many attractions they have to offer, but the prices of this  Magical  place leads me to believe that the average  Joe  and his family are not welcomed, and it's only for those who can afford such an exspence...If this is suppose to be an American past time then why can't everyone enjoy it without having to sell children, tv's, and valuable items just for the price of a ticket?","Negative"
"A bargain compared to the other Disney parks, but well worth it. Lines are not bad at all for a Disney park and with fast passes you can manage your day well. We did the two day pass and did not run out of things to do. We will definitely return again.","Positive"
"This park was a complete let down!!! For Australians and those from queensland it is no where near as good as dreamworld.The rides I thought would be amazing or special but they did not live up to my expectations. The lines are massive and the fast passes still means you have to wait for 30mins on average. The kids rides were longer than the wait for the larger ones with an average wait time of 40mins. This is on a Friday. Would not even consider going on a Saturday the busiest day.After two days my partner and I were sick of it and didn't even go back for the 3rd day we paid for, we had already been on majority of rides multiple times. For children, the park is massive and little legs will get very sore considering mine were aching after 2 days.On the plus side there are water fountains everywhere! My advice would be to start with a one or two day pass and if you feel the need, you can upgrade to the next pass and just pay the difference once you have decided if you need the extra time. If your looking for a park in California I found universal studios amazing and interesting. I will not be returning to Disneyland ever.","Negative"
"This is our 5th time to Disney land Paris and over the years I've learnt!A few hints and tips for any first time goers to DLP.Check and confirm your half board breakfast vouchers as for the first time in five years ours were actually a 15 20 walk into the park (including the ticket booths) in an awfully busy, dark Hyperion cafe (which we were unaware of). The option was not for us. When I expressed my disappointment at the hotel they said we could pay extra (make up the difference) to have the continental breakfast. Which we did do as it was better then an omelette burger!! However not that great due to the flies. It's worth having a looking and choosing a few of the restaurants so you book them on arrival at the hotel otherwise you may miss out on your required time.You can take snacks water into the park in a small bag but it will get checked every time you go in. We took fruit as its expensive in the park however available. The security for the main entrance is a lot longer then the one in the resort park so we found walking was A LOT faster then taking the bus.We did the full board plus option this time around and it saved this family of four a lot. There are restrictions though...there's a set menu (but do ask if your vegan or vegetarian as they may be able to do something). Don't bother waiting in the queue at city mall for a birthday 'gift' unless there's no queue. We were told about it expecting a 'gift' and got a hand written badge lol. Not worth 25 minutes.The parade gets very very busy so I'd recommend doing it early in your stay seating yourself approximately 30 mins before the start next to the curb!! The park offers pushchairs if you don't want to take your own however we do as we can put our food bag underneath.Buy gifts etc at the end of the day so you don't have to look after them as you won't want to leave them on the pushchair when you go on rides.The hotels have an important character come to a designated point in the mornings. Normally a different one each morning which is worth queuing for as it's a lot shorter and inside. Our hotel closed this queue about 10.40 even though the character was there till 11.00. Hope this was useful to some Enjoy yourselves","Neutral"

"It is Disneyland, so it suppose to welcome guests with fun environment. But upon arriving via disney train, I barely can hear the music or feel the disney ish, compared to other disney park. It's quite hot and uncomfortable (July), and lots of people (not sure mainlanders or what) who tend to skip queue, pushing and squeezing themselves around other people. Not comfortable at all. The Disney figure are available at dedicated hotspot for photo taking, unlike other disney park, they are running everywhere and you can easily catch them without the need to queue for almost 1 hour. The parade is fun, and they interact with the audience very well. Food stall are all sufficient enough. There are also halal muslim food at Adventureland which is quite a relieve. But they dont have plenty choices of popcorn bucket as souvenirs, or even slushies cup. Everything seems so expensive here, I wonder why.","Neutral"

"Characters were almost impossible to meet without an appointment only for the character in the hotel at breakfast the trip would have been very poor altogether. Since we stayed for the anniversary celebrations a lot has changed in disneyland paris and not for the better unfortunately. In order to meet a princess you must book in with the princess pavilion at around 10am in the park at the windmill beside small world. You are then given a time and you come back and que with a ticket. When booking your ticket ensure everyone who wished to attend is with you as your park ticket is required. You then enter the pavilion at the time on your ticket at have to que for 40 minutes in a stuffy hallway. You are asked by a cast member if you speak English and are directed to the appropriate que. You then meet which ever random princess and they take a photo which you can view and buy on your way out. If you do the same the following day you are not gaurs teed you won't meet the same princess twice. Your only other option is to visit the very expensive aubergine de centrillion restaurant in which you can dine and meet princesses but with them over and back to the pavilion you may not get to meet them all as you would have a few years ago. Also the food is not great and if you were going you would probably need to get something else in the evening. Most of the counter service restaurants where closed during the day. And my husband went into the park in the evening to go on some more thrilling rides that we couldn't take our daughter on and most of them where closed too. It was very dissapionting as we had a great time when we stayed for Halloween two years previously and really expected a lot more. The spring theme was very pleasing to the eye. The dreams show was good too but that was it. With the lack of restaurants open and no lunch at our disney hotel available it was very annoying on the rainy days as whe you returned to your hotel for a ret and to dry off you had to trek bak to park for lunch and your options where limited to what you could buy. There was also an extreme lack of frozen merchandise Elsas dress, Anna's crown and Olaf was all that was available. Anna's dress was sold out and there where no mugs, dolls or clothing which was annoying as it's so popular. Anna and Elsa are not available to meet either but you can see them in the parade.","Neutral"
"It was my six and eight year olds first time visiting Disneyland. We use the max pass on my phone so they had the opportunity to get on a lot of rides, some more than once. They also loved seeing all the different characters.","Positive"
"While we were there for a  function  we had a chance to walk the park for 3 hours. It was somewhat disappointing. The park really shows it's age. The haunted house which I loved at Disney world has been transformed into a cartoon commercial an absent is the great effects that once graced this attraction. All in all it's still Disney and we had a good time, just a bit maybe of 25 year old memories.","Neutral"
"On our visit the fireworks were cancelled, the Halloween Event cancelled, there were only two Disney Characters we saw in the park, 60% of the restaurants were closed and we cant access on the web the pictures we paid Disney for. All in all a very disappointing days outing. The park is not what is was and certainly not worth the entrance price.","Negative"
"Its was sooooo over croweded and lines were too big ...twice after standing for almost 45mins rides got cancelled due to technical problems...many rides were under renovation....hong kong disneyland is sooooo much better n managed....can be goven miss easily","Negative"
"This is my 2nd time to the park since 2008 and there are new rides added. It was to be a good experience, but the in flux of mainland Chinese tourists during the Chinese New Year break totally ruined the visit. This specific category of tourists do not yet grasp proper manners, and in pursuit of maximizing their return on investment, they would keep pushing their way and cutting queue at every possibility. Common excuses are some family member at the front of the queue when everyone else are toeing the line. And when you dare to even confront them for cutting queues, they cause a major commotion, and challenge you to a fight. Shame on these Mainland Chinese tourists. As an oversea Chinese myself, I could easily observe these Mainland Chinese tourists are despised at for their aggressive behaviors, and the rest of the Chinese folks (Hong Kong, Taiwan, South East Asia, overseas) generally have way better manners. Disneyland HK really needs to implement stricter rules and penalty to these queue jumpers. They are a total nuisance to everyone else.Food by the way is exorbitant as the park totally monopolized the eateries and have little regards for taste. They would first scan your bags for food before entry and force you to dump any, and once you are in there, the food is 3x more expensive than normal Hong Kong caf  , and taste extremely bad. They have the worst food at the whole of Hong Kong! Total rip off from the park.If there's a choice of zero star, I would have given it just that.","Negative"
"It   s Disneyland so is worth a visit, however you need to note the park is quite small.Having visited LA, Florida and Paris, thought I would visit HK Disney whilst in the city. Lots of great Disney touches such as the train you take to the park. I arrived at opening so the ride times were almost instant for the first couple of hours. I spent 6 hours in the park and was surprised that I had completed most of it. It is certainly a lot smaller than its counterparts that I had previously visited.Obviously great for families and Disney fans. Glad I   ve done it but probably wouldn   t go again in the future.","Neutral"
"We had a family three day break in Disneyland Paris over New Year. The park itself was magical and was great fun. It was about minus 9 and sort of snowing which made the visit interesting! Its always going to be difficult at New year in poor conditions but the queues were large and the costs for food seem to have gone up...We went out to the nearby McDonalds and saved a fortune. Seeing the New Year in was slightly disappointing, we were expecting a firework spectacular and got a light show that nobody could see. We joined the thousands that left by 12.15 and unfortunately one of our party ended up on the floor in the push to the exit. Even with this slight issue....It was a stunning few days which we will remember for ages.","Positive"
"Half of the attractions out of order; lines lasting hours, thousands people chewing garbage food and shooting selfies, everything unreasonably expensive. There are millions of better ways to spend hundreds of Euros in Paris.","Negative"
"We enjoyed Disneyland, but the lines for the rides was ridiculous & it was so crowded. You can only get fast passes 1 every 2 hours. Everything is so expensive. If it wasn't for our son not going since he was 3 (and nor remembering), we would not have gone. Our son loved it and I'm glad we went. Won't be going for another 10 years, if that.","Neutral"
"Based on our visit the last weekend of winter it appeared that the vast majority of visitors to Disneyland are annual passholders and locals who grew up with this legendary venue as their backyard playground. They aren't reading this and Disneyland is review proof for them. The rest of us tourists and newbies may have a different view. As someone who has been visiting Walt Disney World in Florida on an occasional basis since its opening in the 70's I had different expectations of Disneyland. I appreciate the history of Uncle Walt's creation but compared with my experiences at WDW I was inevitably disappointed not just by the relatively small real estate to cover but the generally subpar condition of many of the rides and the worn facades of the attractions. Sleeping Beauty's Castle is a little sister compared to her younger sibling, Cinderella's Caste at WDW, where you can dine and meet characters within her walls. The Jedi Training Academy here is in an awkward location with inadequate room for the families of the little Padawans sharing as it does outdoor patio space with the main restaurant in that part of the park, and Tomorrowland as a whole is a huge disappointment. Toontown was fun for our seven year olds but should have been replaced razed a decade ago. And the meet and greet with Anna and Elsa from Frozen was crammed into what appeared to be a large closet previously used for storage. Even though we arrived well before the advertised opening time our wait was two hours. For those arriving in the afternoon it was twice that.Smaller also means severe overcrowding and long lines, especially as the day wears on and the local passholders start making their way in. The FastPass system is better than the alternative, but now that the MagicPlus wristbands of WDW are up and running Disneyland should be next. Since the left coast Disney Parks and hotel staff seem to think they're untouchable I'm not holding my breath. And little enterprisers could be seen gobbling up FastPasses 50 at a time while a couple of their 12 year old lookouts kept their eyes peeled for security. Then they hustled off, no doubt to sell them later to the suckers who couldn't get their own because they were  sold out .Based on the lack of dining options relative to the number of visitors, this venue is a difficult place to visit, and even more so on a hot or rainy day where little is offered by way of shelter. Yes, admission is expensive for the non passholder but imagine how much more crowded it would be with a lower fee to get in. Then there's the generally beaten down attitude of the  cast members , many of whom could be heard talking about their personal problems and their frustrations with their jobs. I overheard one fellow talking about a job interview he just had completed which would allow him to quit. He sounded hopeful. My only hope was that these  cast members  could have held up their end of the bargain and waited until customers were out of earshot to complain about their jobs, which can be disappointing to those of us who buy into the  magic  of Disneyland being the happiest place on earth.So, for this lifelong Disney fan who now has young children, this was a must see. But for us it's one and done. It just isn't worth the expense given all the ride shutdowns midday, the planned closures for overdue maintenance, and the lack of facilities for young children. From now on, we're going (back) to Disney World!","Neutral"
"This Disneyland is a miniature version of the Disney parks found state side. This is also reflected in the price of admission which is notably cheaper than admission to other Disney parks. Contrary to other experiences mentioned, I went on a weekday morning and there were barely any crowds. I managed to do all the main attractions, walk the entire park and get photos with Mickey, Goofy and Winnie and left by 12:30pm. Came back in the evening to see the fireworks which were completely underwhelming. Not sure what happened to the HK Disneyland castle; they had replaced the top with a painted plywood box which distracted from the entire experience. Would not recommend bothering with the journey back for the fireworks if you leave earlier in the day. The park is easily accessible by MTR, about 45 minutes from the city.","Positive"
"We spent 12 days discovering Disneyland and still didn't do everything. The photo pass is great as we have photos of all three of us. This place is magical and we are going back in 10 weeks.","Positive"
"Overcrowded with Chinese tourist who likes to take photos of cute young children without permission. The rides are fun but taking too long to queue. Food offering is good.","Negative"
"Arrives very easily on the MTR which is an absolute godsend.The park entry was quick and easy and eventauly got an English map. I think its only fair to point out to Wetern English people at this point that it is a rugby scrum wherever you go as these people dont que for nothing and will gladly knock you out of the way to get up the line. All rides were open and are a mixture of all rides from the other parks. there is curiosly no water ride! which would have been fun but space mountain is here!!. The shows were done in both english..asian and were great. The parades were so so with not many floats but all the characters seemed to be there. The fireworks are the same as wishes in USA but still good. The place just seemed to lack Disney Magic but when you see kids more interested in bubble making than donald stood at the same point i guess it somes it up.It is funny to see so many people in the gift shop taking pictures of themselves with items form the shop hilarious!!!maybe we have been spoilt as we have seen all the Disneys but this is in the middle better than Eurodisney but way behind Disney USA..worth a visit for 6 hours but definately not 2 days","Neutral"

"My husband and teenage daughter were in Hong Kong in the last week of October, 2014 and took the opportunity to experience Disneyland there. It was our first Disneyland visit, and we enjoyed every bit of it. Quick tips for those going with families :1) Try and book in advance, preferably from your hotel (place of stay) as the tickets are likely to be cheaper than getting them at the entrance.2) Disneyland can be accessed comfortably through Hong Kong MTR. 2) Week days are apparently better as the place is less crowded and so less wait time for rides.3) The HK Disneyland is very much doable in one day; so think twice before getting a two day pass. 4) We didn't take any food along with us, but found security officers to be quite liberal in allowing outside food to be taken inside. Being vegetarians, we regretted not getting our own food, as the food stalls serve mostly non vegetarian snacks and are a little pricey. Indian vegetarian lunch is, however, made available at Tahitian terrace restaurant in Adventure Land.4) The best thrill rides for adults and teens are: space mountain and grizzly gulch   don't miss these. If you are an adrenalin junkie, go for RC racer; we didn't have the appetite for it. 'Mystic manor' was also wonderful. Don't miss 'It's a small world' and the 'Lion King Show' either. Children will love Mickey's Philharmagic (4D show). Most other rides are mild and well suited for smaller children.Our only regret was, despite repeated tries, we couldn't do 'Autopia', which promised to be a thrill ride in the league of space mountain and grizzly gulch; everytime we tried, we were told the waiting time was 45 minutes!And plan your day well so as to stay back for the parade and the fireworks show. In all, Disneyland gives you absolute bang for the buck.","Positive"
"Trip to Hongkong Disneyland is worth a visit. There are a number of shops inside selling different kinds of souvenirs. Also variety of rides are there for both kids and young visitors. You can have pictures with different characters like Mickey, Mouse etc. if you have patience and time to stand in the queue for the same. There are not many eatables for vegetarians, except French Fries at one or two places. One needs almost full day to enjoy various parks here.","Positive"
"If this was your first Disneyland experience, this was ok but not great. For those who are use to American style amusement parks, this would be a bust. You can walk the whole park in about an hour or two and the limited rides were not that exciting as it is here in Calif or Florida.","Neutral"
"After travelling from Australia to visit my dream theme park, I was sadly disappointed.The crowds are excessive , the wait times on rides excessive(some up to 2 hours) the shows difficult to see due to the masses. The express pass booths are situated in ridiculous spots that correspond to the ride, you think they would be right outside the ride but most aren   t and you waste so much time running around trying to find them. Not being able to check in to a new FASTPASS ride for another hour makes it difficult for you to plan your day.if your an adrenalin junkie and looking for thrills this is NOT the place to come. The rides are mostly directed at kids below the age of about 7. Slow , boring , and mostly same ride over and over again just a different carriage in a different land.BEST RIDE IN DISNEYland: buzz light year Astro BEST RIDE IN DISNEY CALIFORNIA: guardian of galaxy and the speedway race car.TOP TIP: if you don   t want to wait 2hours plus for the speedwY race car in Disney California , than I suggest you get up early go to the park on open and check in your fast passes for your group immediately otherwise FASTPASS for this ride is sold out by 11am. (Ridiculous) if not go single rider , at least you get to ride it then.","Negative"
"Never having done a Disneyland before, this was our first experience of one with 2 young children (12& 10). I was a bit dubious for myself but looking back now, this would have to be one of the most memorable family events we have ever had anywhere! We all had an absolute ball but it is a huge day with a 9.00 am start and finish of midnight if you choose to stay for the fireworks. Allow a 45 minute wait for each ride and make sure you spend the extra money on any queue jumping tickets if they are available as well as purchasing the family pass of course. Highly recommend","Positive"
"Having visited Disneyland in Orlando many times this was a disappointment. We were there with our family in May, weather was not great unlike Orlando, so prepare for  British  weather, yes rain, cold and generally unpleasant. However this is only part of the problem! Staff arrive by train from Paris, if there is a delay with their transport then attractions will not open on time. Those of you who stay in Disney accommodation who have early entry to the theme park could be disappointed as the staff are still en route to the park, not great! Go to Orando, it's wonderful, oh yes.","Negative"
"We decided to venture to Disneyland Paris for a hen do. I know you would think it isn't the most usual hen do BUT when we got there all we saw were hen dos. Unfortunately the day we visited the weather was just awful. Torrential Rain from 9am   3pm. Lucky enough we had ponchos to keep us dry. You will feel like a child again when you walk through the gates   running around getting photos. Loads of stores & restaurants... AND YES they are over priced but it is Disney what do you expect. A little disappointed with the new FastTrack business but I guess it is the only way it works. Many years ago when I was a youngster you would purchase a fast track pass & be able to use it for all rides. NOT ANYMORE...now you have a fast track pass where you scan the ticket & it gives you an allocated time in which you are able to use the fast pass & then you can't scan your ticket again for another couple of hours. I guess people were all purchasing fast pass tickets & it didn't make it any faster so this was the only way to resolve that. The parade of course is AMAZING!! It is a must see. Rides are suitable for all ages. Staff here are just awesome especially the folks that are part of the scary rides really make it a better experience staying into character. I can't wait to return   but this time with warmer dryer weather :)","Positive"
"What made me mad was we normally leave during the afternoon crowds and come back around 6pm but couldn't. There was a special event (Halloween party) thus we couldn't do that. Also, it was so crowded that we only spent a single day in the park and found other (free) stuff to do around LA instead, like going to the beach. As Disneyland closed early, there were no fastpasses available during the afternoon so we ended standing in huge lines. What a waste of time and we'll not be coming back anytime soon. Disneyland is packing in huge crowds so I'm sure they could care less.","Negative"
"I love Disneyland but it just isn't the happiest place on earth anymore. I just came back from my second visit this year and no matter what time of year you go, it is so crowded. Yes I expect this but there are just too many people packed in all wanting to see everything. For the most part, the  cast members  try hard to be pleasant and friendly but there are some that do not make customer service their number 1 priority. Maybe with the upcoming expansion it will help with the crowd levels.","Neutral"
"Disappointing day at Disneyland in Paris! The park was absolutely heaving! The queues where unbearable! I queued with my 6 year old son for 1 hour 20 mins to be turned away 5 people from the front due to a technical fault! Nothing they can do of course...but we could have been given a extra fast pass ticket or something to make up for this! But no nothing just turned away!! The fast pass stopped at 4pm, many rides had stopped taking people around 530 6pm. We got fast pass for thunder mountain at 10.30am when we arrived and our ride time was......18.40 so rest of the day we could only have one more fast pass reserved! We only saw 1 Disney character the whole time we where there, which was the most disappointing to be honest! No atmosphere! Was rubbish! Their photo pass is shocking! Don't waste your money on it!    18 for 1 picture! We had 4 pics taken and not one of them included the whole family even though they where all on the ride!  badThe shop was ridiculously priced, along with the food and drinks! But is to be expected in these places! But I queued for 30 mins to pay    50 for 2 adults and 2 kids very basic meals! I had a chicken burger, fried chicken but it had been sitting that long the underneath of the chicken was white and soggy! (That for me is not ok though) The park itself is beautiful, we got some lovely photos of our own but other than that was very unimpressed and felt let down! The adverts make this place looks amazing and it's just not! I wrote a email of complaint to Eurodisney to which I have had no reply as of yet but it's early days!","Negative"
"I really don't see what all the fuss is about,I cannot belive all these reviews saying how fantastic this place is. I can only imagine they are putting something in the overpriced food and drinks.I went with my family in April and found it dreadful.We had tickets as part of a pack but when we got to the end of the line we were rudely sent back to the ticket purchase booth to change the voucher into a ticket.There were very long queues for everything but you could put your ticket in a machine that gave you a slot later in the day   everyone we tried gave a time 6 hours ahead !.My daughter wanted to see 'Captain Jack Sparrow' who was there but we were turned away just before we got to the end of the line 'as her had to go on his lunch break'. Now don't get me wrong but it wasn't Johnnie Depp, with the prices that Disney are charging couldn't they have two !All the staff gave a very bored fixed smile but at the end of the day treated everybody with distain and 'guests' were just pushed along without any sincerity.Numerous rides were not working or temporarily out of order.Going back to California next year and will definately be avoiding this place.Recommend San Diego Animal Park, San Diego Zoo or Universal Studios instead !","Negative"
"Hong Kong Disneyland  did not disappoint. Spent new years eve (my birthday) there and it was an exceptional experience.","Positive"
"I go to HK Disneyland on August 8th, 2013, the weather is super hot with little rain in the afternoon. I suggest you to wear sunblock and bring umbrella (trust me, hat doesn't help at all). It was summer holiday, so the park was crowded, all the rides require you to queue for at least 35 mins (the longest queue is Winnie The Pooh approx. 85 mins).. take Single Rider options because it helps to cut the waiting time, although not much (you still have to queue for   20 mins).The main highlight for me (as 26 years old) are  Flight of Fantasy  parade and  Festival of Lion King  show. Flight of Fantasy  parade begin at 1.00 AM from Main Street USA, we stand around the castle area for   20 mins before the parade pass. The parade is fun, detailed & colorful, if you're Disney lover, don't miss the parade, it truly resembles the soul of Disney, every cast member is friendly & full of smile, they will interact with us too (i get a blow of kiss from the green painted Toy Soldier :p) Festival of Lion King  show is beyond the expectation, the stage is circle shaped so you can get clear view to performers. The show itself is lively, energetic and beautiful, you will see a lot of performance from singing, dancing, aerial ballet to acrobatic show (with fire). I found myself waving to every performer passing in front of me :D they're so good!Too bad i'm late for  Golden Mickey  show :( you must queue at least 45 mins before the show time   For the ride, if you are an adrenaline junkie like me, HK Disneyland is not my cup of tea, all the ride is for kids although they have good thematic interior and visual merchandise:1. Jungle River Cruise   (for kids & family) It quite fun, the animatronic is good, looks like real. Our guide is fun too, although her English is a bit hard to understand. Overall is an enjoyable ride with parents.2. Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars   (for kids) The grizzly bear animatronic is nice looks like real one. The roller coaster itself is just so so, the fun part is when the mine cars fall backward.3. RC Racer   (for kids & young adult) This ride might be the most disappointing for me, i queue for almost an hour for just 5 times swinging back and forth   .4. Mickey's Phillarmagic   (for kids & family) The 4D effect is fun, the smell of food thrown on the screen, the blow of wind, the splash of water.. although the movie itself is blurry and a bit bluish.5. It's A Small World   (for kids & family) This is a doll castle, you sit on a boat and watch dolls waving, dancing and singing  It's A Small World  in different languages. All the dolls are dressed up in colorful, detailed, pretty outfits. It feels like you're in wonderland, everything is cute and colorful.6. Space Mountain   (for kids & young adult) it's like riding a roller coaster in dark space, full of flickering lights, with little help of imagination it's like you're in outer space. As the effect of sudden turn, ups and downs, my head stumble left right up down and get super dizzy   @.@Closing the day is fireworks at 9:00 PM in the castle area. Before that time, castle area is already crowded with people, i found out the view of fireworks is still okay from the Main Street USA area, so there's no point to jostle with crowd :D The fireworks itself isn't extravagant, what makes it different because the fireworks is in harmony with the music, and it's from the back of the castle, so it's like watching a Disney movie.I would definitely come back to HK Disneyland to watch all show and parades  3 I think this park is more suitable for first time Disneyland visitor or kids. But after all, Disneyland will always be the happiest place on earth :)PS: Bring extra money to buy souvenirs. The food price is high, my lunch (at The Explorer's Club) is a set of seafood kway teow   fish ball soup   iced lemon tea for HKD$118 (!) although the portion is decent, the kway teow is tasteless with crab stick and meatball instead of fresh seafood. I recommend you to order Japanese set of grilled salmon with rice and vegetables for HKD$138, it tastes much better than my kway teow :","Neutral"

"This was my third visit to Disneyland, and I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. In the past every effort was made to conceal the inner workings of all the rides and attractions so that the experience was magical. Sadly, this is no longer the case, and when you can see how it's done, the magic is gone.Some of the cast members were less than friendly, too. Admittedly, it was VERY hot (100 ), and many people were cranky because of it, but the concept of hospitality was just not the same during this visit as it has been in the past.","Positive"
"There's no place quite like Disneyland. You definitely get bang for your buck. You can feel the magic as soon as you arrive. There is music playing, people smiling. Yes, there are lines for everything. Disneyland is always going to be busy but get there...More","Positive"
"This was are 3rd visit not good so much is closed this puts pressure on the other rides,all this at peak season,waiting times for most rides 45 60'we tried differant times of day early start or syayed late they really need to plan better and invest in more big rides last time we went you could use the fast pass system but this seems non exsistant now with only a few rides useing the system also why on the peter pan ride does fast pass not open until 11.30 it does not make sense. On two rides space mountain and pirates of the cariibbean it broke down just before we where about to get on this is meant to be a premium product they certainly charge premium prices i think for us this will be our last visit not worth the money or the hassle,get you act together Disney!","Negative"

"Park was dirty and not well designed. Very hard to navigate around. Eating places very mediocre, as you would expect well overpriced. dissapointed not to see Disney characters walking around. Very long lines for all attractions.","Negative"
"This was a lot like the Disneyland in California actually when you walk in it is a exactly the same.  Many of the out side attractions are different but better because it is only 10 years old so it is very nice.","Positive"
"Was a good day out, no waiting in line. Would of been good if the castle was open. Closed for refurbishment which was a shame","Neutral"
"One of the things you must not do if you are planning a visit here is compare it to other Disney parks around the world. Having been to Disney World, it's easy to see why people would unfavourably compare Disneyland Paris to Disney World. But as a stand alone vacation destination, I think Disneyland Paris is superb.We spent four days at both parks, spending three of those in Disneyland Park itself. It's a really great park with some great rides and attractions. The parades are good and we enjoyed the end of day show, Dreams (even if we watched it in quite horrendous rain and soaking wet clothing).Naturally, prices inside the park are extortionate. But the security in the park doesn't seem quite as strict as other Disney parks. People were able to bring food and drink into the park. They also did vouchers for free drinks from certain locations at certain times, which was very well received. In busy park days, make sure you stake your spot for the parades and shows early. Typically, we would find a spot an hour before hand. This was vital   and a lot of people try to barge in as time gets closer.","Positive"
"This was my first visit to Disneyland and was amazed from the beginning. Walking up main street to see the castle in front was jaw dropping. I sent the whole timw I was there in complete ow and was amazed throughout. The queues were quite big for the more popular rides but didnt end up waiting too long as the staff had it under control well. The parade was really good and the fireworks were just amazing","Positive"
"As usual the park is spotless and the staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. There were some problems with rides breaking down (Haunted Mansion, Big Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones, Space Mountain) to the point that we bailed out on Christmas Day and went to a movie. We were very happy with the Star Tours update and the updated Pirates of the Caribbean (our last visit was in 2002). The Haunted Mansion is always well decorated at Christmas.If yo go over a major holiday, be patient and expect crowds. With the right planning you can have an enjoyable time   we did!","Positive"
"Kind of disappointing because many places were closed during our visit probably because it   s on a week day. In addition quite a few attractions were under refurbishment so limited things we can do. We were stuck in a few places because of technical problems and so we could do even less. We end up having to go for kiddie rides which we normally won   t do.","Neutral"
"Firstly I LOVE DISNEYLAND PARIS(we dont usually go when its so busy but it was mine and my sons Birthday weekend so what better excuse to go) but this visit left a less magical glow in my tummy. From the waiting lines to see characters(2 hours to get a photo with Donald Duck? no thanks) The lack of characters(Minnie, Woody, Donald Duck were the ONLY characters we seen throughout the whole park!) and they were only visible behind a line of stressed parents and screaming kids who had clearly waited over a hour  to get a photo.(if you have more than 1 day in this park then fine, wait but we only had 1 day in each park so did not have the whole day to wait around for a photos) The rides were busy as always, its the summer holidays, we expected this but the amount of people we witnessed just pushing into the line was a joke and caused a lot of issues( I am not one to stand back and watch this so a few words were said but the staff just did not seem to care) The parade...hmmmm We expected to see Star wars characters? Maybe a few marvel characters like in the adverts...nope same floats as always...hardly worth the 45 minutes we wasted getting a good viewing spot. I sat my children down at the front along with a lot of other children and most adults stood back so more children could have the best views of the parade but trust me not everyone is as caring! (be prepared for people to just stand in front of you or plonk their kids in front of yours and not give a cr*p! again you have to ask them to move or push them back or your children will not see anything, next time we go we will not waste our time watching the parade unless is Christmas, Halloween ect. The rides are as good as always...Big Thunder Mountain!!! come on, will anyone ever get tired of this ride? we got fastpass tickets at 3pm for this ride for a time slot at 7.30pm so get them early. We did not stay for the fireworks 11pm ( i was gutted) my 7 year old gave up at around 9.30pm, he was tired, cranky and had blisters on his feet from all the walking round so we just headed back to our hotel.","Neutral"
"We took our six year old along to see Disneyland for the first time as she is an avid follower like most children of Disney classics and new features and characters.The park doesn't disappoint it has all the features you would want to see and a few extras, we had a wonderful experience on the daywe would only point out that we received very poor service quality and customer care for the french attendantsBe careful if you buy your tickets on the internet and you duly print them off ready to attend the park as the disney internet tells you too, be prepared to be the most frustrated you have ever been when arriving at the park and you are told that you can't come in until you convert your tickets to formal tickets which you can only get from guest services, a facility that has no idea that the customer is there for a paid experience.You are an unwelcome intrusion to their day, we even had a manager that come to take us away as the attendant had no command of the english language, the manager had even less and was extremely rude to my wife, try to complain and things just get worseWe found the characters to be very accommodating and very receptive to the prodding nature of young children excited but he experience, they handlers are so task focused though be ready for very rude (probably due to the culture of the country) and abrupt behaviour when the character need to be changed over, you can wait in queues for literally hours and then all of a sudden the characters are taken away and you with many other people are left to deal with crying children who have waited patiently, perhaps simply getting the characters to walk the remaining que to acknowledge the ever patient children would be a good idea rather than the callous we must go!!anyway great park poor service and absent empathy with children","Neutral"
"Fun & exciting park.  Absolutely magical.   Admission price to park is way too expensive plus pay to park.   Food, beverages, mementos in gift shops, pix on rides    all overpriced.","Neutral"
"I wish I had time to write a detailed review here but I wanted to get this online.35 degrees C all week and very little shade anywhere at the park! I'm 47 and in good shape, I can't imagine how others deal with this and why Disney cares so little about their patrons that they don't worry about providing shade. Unless you happen to be standing, waiting for a ride that is inside one of the buildings Disney doesn't worry about putting up covers anywhere and certainly doesn't provide misters or cool zones like they do at Universal. WHY??? I'm glad they provide lots of drinking fountains but if you are not a fan of standing or walking around in the sun without relief you better be prepared as Disneyland is a difficult place to get out of the sun, especially at Toon Town and Fantasy Land.Hope this heads up helps some unsuspecting person be better prepared for what to expect in the summer.","Negative"
"Too Small and Overcrowed with Obnoxious Visitors from the world's most populous country who have no manner and don't know what civilization mean.  The place itself is very small (too small) compared to other Disney property around the world","Negative"
"First I must say I love Disney. Hong Kong Disney has the Disney feel and it wasn't crowded. This Disney park is very small and it caters to children 12 and under. There aren't any attractions for older children such as roller coasters and other fast rides. I walked around for 2 1 2 hours and rode the subway back to the hotel. I'm glad I went to Hong Kong Disney. ","Neutral"
"Great water show best part of the day didn't have to wait long for rides shame so much was closed as we went in January lots of repaires","Positive"
"My husband and I went on a Sunday and there were sooooo many people with such long lines for everything. It was difficult to walk through the crowds and we really didn't have any space because there was always someone right next to us throughout the entire 8 hours we spent there! The pizza we ate ($8.00 1 slice!) near Space Mountain was horrible; do not go there unless you enjoy wasting your money! Small World wasn't open and the Monorail was having  technical difficulties  after we stood in line & wasted 45 minutes of our time. Lastly, we really felt that the park was  outdated  and not as clean as in years past. We felt that Disney needs to spend some of the millions that they earn each year in beautifying the park upgrade the rides. Comparing Disneyland to CA Adventure Park is a no brainer, go to CA Adventure Park instead.","Negative"
"I visited Disneyland Paris on the 29th of July, i have made online reservation for the 1 day   1 park tickets for me and my girlfriend on the same day we're visiting so we don't waste time waiting in Q to get our entrance pass at the gate, it came to my surprise that my tickets are only valid 1 day after purchase, so i went to there customer relations office and they told me i can buy new tickets on the door to get access and i can refund my online tickets on their website. After returning i contacted there website and they said the tickets are non refundable but are valid for 1 year. After my experience with them i will never go back there again, 3 adult rides were closed due to unknown reasons, waiting line to take a picture with mickey mouse is 45 minutes, food was terrible ate at the   Cottonwood creek, Cowboy cookout barbq   we found a small rat running around while we were eating inside which made us throw our food and leave. now i have two tickets for sale if anyone is interested, am willing to sell them less then what they're worth because i dont want them","Negative"
"Disney is a must stop if you're in Anaheim! Any of the rides are fun, such as Indiana Jones, Space Mountain, Star Tours and more! Get a fast pass for the longer lines and space out your day between the two parks.

And don't forget Aladdin heads in around 3pm!","Positive"
"This is the third time of coming to Disneyland Paris, this time with my wife and youngest daughter only.The park had been revamped to celebrate its 25th anniversary, it was high season so large queues at peak times which could be avoided by use of the free 2 hours 8 10 magic hours (if you're staying in a Disney hotel) or taking advantage of the fastpass tickets.The weather was nice though can be hot waiting in the queues.Even though our third visit in the last few years still magical holiday, my daughter having breakfast with characters and lunch with the princesses, the shows were good and the dreams firework display with lights   story   music at the castle excellent if you can put up with waiting for 1 2 hours to get a good view.","Positive"
"We went to euro Disney while on a family holiday from Australia. All my daughter wanted to do for her birthday was to go to Disney. We went all 9 of us and were shocked at how terrible it was. Long delays many rides not even working ( which we weren't told as we paid) Smoking parents everywhere. Hands down the worst day of our European holiday. My sad little girl left after being on 2 dud rides quoting   Never go to Disney it ruins childhood dreams ","Negative"
"With the park gearing up for its 25th anniversary, many of the main attractions are closed for renovations. In addition many of the services and venues were not open. The weather was cool and the lines were long. It would have been nice if the rates were discounted to reflect the lack of choices right now. We also find the park was overall dated and tired. It was clean. It is still a wonder for small children but has limited appeal to teens or adults, in our opinion.","Negative"
"My fourteen year old daughter and I recently spent one of our six days in Paris at Disneyland. What a waste of a day. I guess we assumed that Disneyland Paris would offer an experience similar to what we have enjoyed a half dozen times in Orlando. Boy, were we wrong.First, we arrived from Paris by train right at opening time only to discover that there were just two people conducting security checks for all the people exiting the RER station. Seems to me that Disney customer service should be able to figure out that they might need more staff at busy times. So this was that start to our day: a thirty minute wait to have someone check my backpack.The staff that IS working at Disneyland Paris obviously does not benefit from the same training that their colleagues in America do. They were ornery, disheveled, inattentive, and     quite honestly   most appeared to be a bit daft. On several occasions, they even left their posts. Once while we were boarding    Rockin    Rollercoaster    and twice on    Space Mountain   , we were left to make our way to the trains and load ourselves in. This happened over and over so, consequently, we saw time and time again the rides leave the station with empty seats. More serious, perhaps, was that fact that on one of our turns on    Space Mountain   , no one ever checked to see if our harnesses were fastened. A major safety breech, I would imagine.The park itself was very    tired    looking, dirty, and in need of repair. The plaza in front of Disney Studios has holes in it where the concrete has worn away, buildings and rides need either a good scrubbing or a coat of paint, and the bathrooms were disgusting. I   ve always been so impressed with the attention to detail in Orlando. No such attention to detail is evident in Paris.And then there   s the smoke. Dear French People, have you not heard of lung cancer? You NEED to STOP smoking! And Dear Disneyland Paris, if you   re going to advertise the park as    Smoke Free   , it had better be. And if you   re going to have rules against smoking in line, you need to enforce them. The smoke was awful.On the up side,    Space Mountain    is (in my opinion) far better than the ride in Orlando.    Rockin    Rollercoaster    is just as good, although they don   t use the same recording studio setup for the ride, and    Tower of Terror    was fine.The one word I would use to describe our day at Disneyland Paris is disappointing. We were looking forward to enjoying a day like we have so many times at Walt Disney World and it just didn   t happen. If it tells you anything, I spent part of my day today looking for the address where I can write Disney CEO Robert Iger. The opening part of the letter to him will read:   Dear Mr. Iger, When was the last time you visited Disneyland Paris? From what I can tell, I   m pretty sure it has been a while. And I   m certain that when you do, you   ll be appalled.","Negative"
"I'm really glad we saw Disneyland Paris. I live in California and visit Disneyland California Adventure annually. So, when we decided to go to Paris, of course we had to check out Disney Paris.First of all, Downtown Disney is very small. They you can find currency exchange, Planet Hollywood, Starbucks (yeah), McDonald's with free wifi, Rainforest Cafe, a number of Disney stores, a few restaurants, and that's about it. Disney Studio is wonderful. I think we really enjoyed it because we have nothing to compare it to in California. I enjoyed the tour tram, the Toy Story section was awesome. Disneyland Paris had some unique items, but not many. I think there should be way more Disney Paris items than there were. I don't want to buy something I can buy at home. Very limited in merchandise of characters other than Mickey and Minnie. Thunder Mountain Railroad (our favorite at home) was closed in Paris yet again for a 2nd derailment in 6 months. It's a small park. Very few cast members, almost none. Very dark in some of the lands to the point of being a bit scary. Very few food offerings and extremely expensive at that. The biggest turn off were the restrooms. They were filthy and smelled of urine. Not at all to our Disney standard. The Disney hotels were beautiful.","Neutral"
"As a lover of all things Disney, and someone who has frequented both Disney parks in America multiple times I was really excited about visiting Disneyland Paris. Disney is known for creating a magical experience, a place to escape reality, but this was not the case.The staff were rude, I never saw them smile, and when we'd ask them a question it was as if we were inconveniencing them. Guests were smoking everywhere, not just in designated areas, the gift stores were a joke. The only Mickey ears I saw were the light up ones, there were not many food options and there was no wifi in the park either.I did not feel like I was in a Disney park, I felt like I was at a low budget theme park.I will not return to Disneyland Paris as I was beyond disappointed with the overall atmosphere and experience.Someone needs to go in there and train their staff the Disney way or shut the park down before it taints the Disney name even more.","Negative"
"Disneyland is run by some slick operators. Since it was the off season, on a weekday, the park had shorter hours than usual, but the ticket prices were not any shorter. The lines for the attractions were not any shorter, either, owing to the closure of numerous rides, which concentrated the crowds into a smaller space. Overall, I would say that this would have been an OK experience if it didn't cost so much. The park is beautifully maintained and the cast is wonderful, but my older kid, who is ten, summed it up best,   The rides are fun, but there are better things to do on a vacation than wait in lines.","Neutral"
"We visited Disneyland Paris over the Easter so fully expected it to be busy. We arrived early as advised to find thousands already queuing. We soldiered on. We had been advised to buy the two park ticket as both could easily be done in a day. That advice was rubbish. We queued for over an hour for the first ride and over 90 minutes frontage second. We then watched a Disney parade which was actually very good and brought a smile to this haggard face. Having had enough of queuing we then decided to go to the studio park. This is a much better park but closes at 5 in April so we only had 2 hours there. A wasted ticket for sure. I have been to Disney world in Florida which did not really impress me either but the Paris park is just shambolic. I am sure it is great if you have small children and a large wallet but for adult couples...avoid it! ","Negative"

"We took a tour bus to Paris Disney in October 2008. There was two parts. We did both parks very well and had time to spare.We were there when it open and left at 7:00 pm. The rides are very similar and were very disappointing to me. Over all because I have been to Disneyland and Disney world. I would rate this park for me a two out of five. The best ride was the tram tour.I love Cimagitic which should be a must do for all.","Neutral"

"First time Disney goer here and I was absolutely blown away by my experience at Disneyland Paris. Staff were really friendly and helpful and the parade was magical. I'm a grown woman wise never been a massive Disney fan but visiting the park far exceeded my expectations and was honestly amazing! I'd definitely recommend buying tickets in advance to avoid queueing at the entrance and also make the most of any attractions that have a fast track option as this will also save lots of time. For anyone concerned about prices in the park.....in all honesty somewhat extortionate prices are to be expected at an attraction like this. For snacks, food and drink it is expensive but not ridiculous. Maybe 30% above average of what you'd pay outside. I'd HIGHLY recommend taking a water bottle in as there are fountains were you can fill up. Anyone looking to save money on food....you can always take your own food in. Plus there are options to cater to all budgets so you're not forced into only expensive options. I went to a buffet for dinner and it was definitely worth the price! If you've got a smartphone, definitely download the app as this really helped us to plan out our day and make the most of our time in there. All in all I had a amazing time in the park and can't recommend it enough!","Positive"
"I hear so much about Universal Studios I was really surprised at this place. Lots of fun. I loved the Star Wars area and getting a picture with Darth Vadar. I felt like I was in the movie. As with all of these parks, expect the wait times.","Positive"
"Travelled overland by coach. Disney was about 30 mins from our hotel. Our time at the park was 10am until 10pm. We thought this would be too long, but oh no. The time flew by. Tips   if you want to eat at a particular restaurant book it as soon as you get to the park at the county hall  information point. Choose a time to eat. The main parade was 5.30 p.m. People begin to sit around the front of the castle from about 4pm to get a prime spot to view the parade. While this is happening the second park area begins to thin of the crowds enabling you to go and take advantage of getting onto rides quicker. Plenty of places to eat, maps available, easy to follow. One gripe   the characters were few and far between for photo opportunities. It was sunny and hot, very open, not much shade, so in the summer months take sun cream, sun hats and water. Enjoyable experience. If you don't mind crowds and queueing do it!","Neutral"
"This is perhaps the most difficult review I have ever done. There are so many things I liked but were also balanced by so many I didn't like. We were a family of 6 and was in the park for 13 hours. In that time we were able to ride all of the major attractions but that was about it. Although you can get fast passes for most of these rides the two we had fast passes for were shut down when we returned. They were good for any time after the rides came back up and we were able to use them later in the day. For the rest of the rides I would say we averaged 45 to 60 minutes in line for each one. So the hate in this is the wait but the love is the fantastic well designed magical ride you get. Next comes the hate for the arm to arm crowds, the constant being ran over by kids and strollers but then comes the love of the World of Disney Goofy Mickey experience you can't find anywhere else. This was my first time here and I can make a few suggestions. Do your homework, that is research the time when the tourist season should be down, study the park maps ahead of time so you have a better idea of how to get around. The park has little to no signage to point you in any direction to find where you are going. Bring more money than you think you need just in case. Get to a major ride just as soon as you get in the park as the lines will be smaller at that time, then get fast passes as quickly as you can for the rest of the rides you want to do. At the end of the day this an attraction you should have on your list of things to do and especially if you have kids. Perhaps the most positive thing I enjoyed was having dinner at Caf   Orleans and the fireworks towards the end of the evening. However, its still a 50 50 love hate kind of a thing for me and I won't do it again. For more of an adult kind of attraction with less crowds kids I would prefer and go back to Knott's Berry Farms.","Neutral"
"I grew up going pretty regularly to Disneyland in Anaheim, California (my family lived about 40 minutes from there). I now am pretty ambivalent about Disney and Disneyland in general. As a child, I loved Disneyland and Disney movies and characters, but in adolescence the  fakeness  of Disneyland started bothering me, and now as an adult I realize how important it is to find a variety of options to entertain children (and for them to entertain themselves), and am much more aware that spending a lot of money isn't necessary for children to have fun. The  Disney experience  is so expensive, and many people cannot afford it. We bought a three day pass for the Disneyland outside of Paris and were there in late February 2013. We stayed at a very nice but inexpensive hotel one metro stop away from the parks. It had a kitchenette (including small refrigerator, stove, microwave, tableware, and a mini dishwasher) so we purchased groceries at the nearby E. Leclerc in the mall. Preparing simple meals in our room helped us to keep expenses down. Disneyland was a big disappointment. It was unusually cold and it even snowed; we are from a very cold area in the US and so have plenty of experience dealing with inclement weather, but Disney doesn't. Many rides closed. Lines were long (waits ranged from 45 to 90 minutes); Fast Passes ran out early; adults smoked cigarettes in lines but weren't asked to stop by employees; bathrooms weren't well attended to; and overall for us adults, it wasn't much fun. I don't think that the weather was only the cause of all this. Our daughter thoroughly enjoyed herself  this was her first trip to a Disneyland and she was happy to go on the rides for younger children. She also loved meeting Mickey, and we appreciated the one on one time in the room with  him,  and the photo opportunities. So all that said: If going to Disneyland is your and or your child's dream, go for it. Be prepared for the expense. If you are on the fence about going, or are considering other options, I'd say spend the money and the time on a different excursion.","Negative"
"Unfortunately a lot of closures and no mainstreet parade. Disneyland will always be special. It's a fun and exhausting few days. We did 3 day hopper passes but we could have done both parks in two days. We were 4 adults. Food choices weren't as good and we've noticed the park doesn't have the same friendly vibe or pristineness it had 12 years ago.","Positive"
"I grew up with fantastic memories of Disney in Orlando, I've been waiting for my daughter to be old enough to remember the trip to appreciated it. Paris is a four hour drive from me, got to the park without insident and parked right away, arriving around 1030 on a Saturday, took about 30 minutes to get into the atrium and pass security. Even at that earlier hour, the park was packed and wait times for all rides exceeded 45 minute. Every bathroom we used was absolutely discusting, only met three staff members which displayed that  Happiest place on earth  persona, all were located in the meet and greet with Micky Mouse. The rest of the staff was well spoken but no smiles or any type of enthusiasm what so ever. The biggest surprise was the lack of characters walking around the park, which was a highlight for me as a child collecting autographs, at this park your required to make reservations to meet certain Disney characters, which i didn't even dream of to research, my daughter came prepared with an autograph book, and left the park in tears after only getting one autograph from Mickey after a two hour wait. We tried to have captain jack sign her book, but he just patted her on the head and walked away. He was the only character we saw in the park walking around all day. The biggest disappoint for my husband; he had his heart set on purchasing the trademark Disney Mickey Mouse hats with our names on them, apparently Disney Paris doesn't sell these at all ?!? It could be my family and myself aren't theme park people, or we had too high of expectations from parks in the states. I will say the Swiss family treehouse was fantastic, the parade at the end of the day was fun, but we had to sit in the side of the rode for two hours to make sure we had a descent view. To conclude; if you have the patience to stand in lines all day in the heat go for it, if not, save your money and visit the other thousands of attractions within Europe that are free.","Neutral"
"This was my first time at Disneyland and it did not let down. Staff is so friendly and helpful. The prices are high, but you see that with every amusement park. You truly feel like a little kid as soon as you walk in the gates. The park is huge. I recommend visiting at least two days to fit it all in, three if getting the park hopper pass and going to Disney California Adventure also.","Positive"
"Turns out July 3rd is a good day to go to Disneyland. Longest wait was 20 minutes (Splash Mountain.)","Positive"
"After visiting Disneyland Paris and The Universal Studios in Singapore, Disneyland Hong Kong was not so great. The attractions are mainly for kids and even the 'most extreme' are never so exciting. Some of them were under maintenance and the 'soldier parachute' was still being tested at 12.00pm which is unacceptable for those who pay a 1 day ticket.The worst was Star Wars attraction which is basically nothing compared to the Transformers attraction at the Universal Studios. They only used some projections and lights, no high speed, no 3D or 4D effects!If you want to take a picture with Disney characters you have to queue for longtime..why don't they hire more staff to represent Disney characters and let them walk around so everybody can have the chance to take a pic?? At Disneyland Paris we took a lot of pics and the characters walked around at any time! I love Disney world but I think this Disneyland should definitely improve.","Neutral"
"Had a good day out here but it wasn't fantastic. Great infrastructure and we thoroughly enjoyed the Aerosmith ride, but overall the park is a bit tired. Food was average and junky, nothing healthy was available which was unfortunate. After    24 for a poorer version of McDonalds we felt robbed and slightly worse for wear. Fast pass idea is flawed, we went to space mountain to get a fast pass and the fast pass line looked just as long as the regular line. Defeats the purpose really! Queuing was 90 minutes at the ratatouille ride, and we were informed that fast passes were no longer available, so had to go without. Not sure about the logic here.We did not come across any staff who looked pleased to be at work, except for the dancers in the Main Street USA area. Staff operating the food stalls especially were unhelpful and snooty, which brought down the happy and cheery Disney experience.Thoroughly recommend buying tickets to both parks which we did upon recommendation by our hotel, there is not enough to do in either park alone. Had a great time at Disneyland in Los Angeles a few years ago, but was sadly disappointed by Paris's version. Would not come back","Neutral"
"I visited this place in June 2014, its worth it  to spend a whole day. even the shows are also nice,   going with family then kids will enjoy at lot.","Positive"
"I am aiming to take my kids to all Disney theme parks and on the Disney cruise. In 2012 we went to Orlando, this year Hong Kong, next year Paris etc.I recommend going to HK Disney if you specifically want to go to Disneyland however if you're after rides and theme parks then Ocean Park is actually better.As a Disney theme park, it has all the great rides we love including buzz lightyear, carousel etc etc. There were long lines so we spent more time in the rides area they didn't have in Orlando such as the Toy Story area and Jungle Book.It was easy to get to via the MTR (Tung Ching line, get off at Sunny Bay and you won't miss the trains going to Disney) with the added bonus of catching a Disney train complete with the little details Disney are known for (e.g. mickey shaped windows).You can also buy the tickets from various MTR stations but we bought ours at the gates and there were no lines so we had no issues.","Neutral"
"I went with a girlfriend, both of us 30 (22 years ago). It was fun, but... honestly, I wish we'd had  a couple of Disney crazed kids in tow...","Neutral"
"Let me first say this, the park is great. It looks really nice and at night it is something else but. Never again. The Cheyenne hotel is one bad stay. The main bed has a bad matras with a wooden plank under it. Both me and gf hardly slept. She is half my weight sobthat can't be it. The bunkbed actuallycwas a pull out and guess what much better then the Main bed. We actually slept.The park itself..waiting for 30 60 minutes for a ride. Unbelievable. The food partners.... To cry about. PLANET HOLLYWOOD?? BAD BAD BAD FOOD, MARGARITA'S.. VIRGIN hardly any alcohol even after pointing that out. It tasted like leftovers, wings... Burned, vegieburger was a potatoburger. The Angus burger...where was the Angus? All in all the only experience I can talk positively about.. Wild West show. Great evening but the dinner... Comeon guys NO vegies? At least expected coleslaw. We left the thurd day in the morning left with a sad and disappointed feeling. Staff needs to be trained in English and the French language was to dominant. Sad to say my birthday trip was not what I expected. Euro Disney is nothing compared to the US. Sorry but not for us.","Neutral"
"As said in your own TripAdvisor page  it's the happiest place on earth! Well I have to say that this experience was a massive disappointment and when compared with our experience at Universal just appalling.In this land of magic and dreams we found all the staff to be miserable and unhelpful they just looked so depressed and like they didn   t want to be there, they didn   t make us feel welcome and with me being blind I received no support at all be it getting on or off rides or help with queues.In our day we managed just 4 rides yes just 4 rides, it was way too overcrowded we knew that in August it would obviously going to be busy and hot, but there was no shade whilst waiting for rides and very minimal shade whilst walking around the park, in one queue we were in a lady fainted due to the lack of shade and heat. Many queues were 45 80 minutes long which doesn   t help. Another issue that made things worse was that the fast track queues had such an impact on everyone more of them were getting pushed along leaving everyone else behind. I don   t have an issue with people paying the extra to get ahead, but Disney really need to control numbers here as it significantly penalises others.Out of the four rides we went on at Disney, I would say that the Space Mountain rollercoaster is best and not to be missed, that   s if you can get on. As you would expect the gift shops are pricy, as is food and drink (although comparing favourably with similar attractions), it just seemed to take the mick being charged a further 20 dollar for parking on top of an already pricey 97 dollars for a ticket.This was a birthday treat and first visit for my partner, who was extremely disappointed. I love Disney Florida but I just cannot recommend Disneyland California at all and I am sure Walt Disney would be mortified if he could see his creation today!","Negative"
"I am a huge Disneyland fan (Anaheim) and have been many times. When the opportunity arose to visit Hong Kong Disney I did not hesitate. We were lucky   we visited on a very quiet day   we had no lines on most of the rides (only Autopia 30 mins and Dumbo 20 mins). The rest we just walked on!! It was amazing and allowed us to do the whole park easily in one day! You could not count on this!!We came straight from the airport on the MTR   had to do a couple of transfers but it was very easy. We utilised the lockers at Disney to store our things for the day. (we travelled light so only had a small backpack each)It was a fun day that I would not have missed however it cannot be compared to Anaheim or Florida in regards to size or atmosphere.","Positive"
"I went here with quite optimistic expectations. I was expecting a fun park for kids, but in reality it really is for everyone! The rides are brilliant and with it being October there was never any longer than 5mins waiting times for any rides. Most rides are indoors so the bad weather didn't hinder our day either. Really can't wait to visit again!!","Positive"
"This park has been around for a long time, but they charge you a LOT of money to visit it. It used to be ok because the prices for souvenirs and food were very reasonable. But that is no longer the case, expensive to get in and expensive to eat and to buy souvenirs. Here is something that I found the next day you can bring food and drinks in cooler. I highly recommend you do this. Also get there as soon as they open, because by 10:00 AM the park is full!!!","Neutral"
"Went during the off peak season and quite a few restaurants stalls rides were closed   too many for my liking and some restaurants even closed early (surely worthy of some sort of discount to get in?!). The food and drink is expensive although you can get cheaper snacks and drinks from the Relay shop (the larger one of the two) in the train station. The fast food is atrocious and unimaginative compared with the likes of Hong Kong Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea. Only one flavour of popcorn was available   no caramel, chocolate, curry, honey, milk tea, salt and pepper, soy sauce, strawberry, white chocolate, etc. The stalls only sold candy apples and doughnuts   no churros, cookies, frozen yoghurt, hot dogs, pizza cones, waffles, etc.We did get to see a lot of characters however and as the Halloween season was beginning, the villains were out in force, even doing their own show followed by a meet and greet. Rafiki and Timon on 1 10 15 were great, full of energy and mischief, as they perked up our spirits after a long day.There were a lot of smokers in the park. What is wrong with people? Why is smoking not banned here? The majority of the Disney staff were friendly and went out of their way to help you except for one   Stephane. Rude, grumpy, unhelpful with a bad attitude. Not what you'd expect from a Disney employee and ruined your mood.Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast is always fun but it constantly broke down while we were on it and some of the targets didn't work (tested thoroughly during the many disruptions).Bring a coat, the area is flat and gets very breezy when you're outside.","Negative"
"I thought the second week of sept. would be a great time to vist disneyland, boy was I wrong. I was saddened that they had 3 Major rides closed @ the same time, they weren't using fast passes for Thunder. And I felt that because it was so crowded they should have extended the park hours. I am supposed to return in Oct. but not sure if I will or not.","Neutral"
"We paid full price while 16 !! attractions were closed for renovation. Also restaurants were closed, so it took us 1,5 hours to wait for our food... It was sunny and warm, one would expect all icecream shops would be open, h  las! Waiting hours were sometimes 220 minutes, which is expected when 1 3 of all attractions is closed! Fast pass check in for the same day had to be arranged before 11am, no possibilities to use your fast pass for the next day. To know about the renovated attractions, you have to dig deep on their website. Expensive, crowded and dissapointing, those were the main impressions of all our family.","Negative"
"It's always great to be able to take a trip to Disneyland but I may say that the customer service is horrible. Out of three days that we where there only a hand full of time we were told to have a magical day or thank you for that matter. We won't be planning another trip to Disney park any time soon after the bad experience with costumer service. ","Negative"
"Despite being a seasoned traveller I just couldn't cope with the cultural differences. To most Brits and Americans the French will come across as incredibly rude! We lost count of the number of times we were shoved out of the way, coughed on, had food thrown over us...the list goes on. After my 4 year old had been physically kicked off her seat during the stunt show, we could stand no more and came home. Every country has it's fair share of morons, but France's share all seemed to be on a trip to Disneyland this weekend.","Negative"
"We went in the UK half term with friends so it was expected to be be kids around, the characters I saw were 2 Princess' going onto a break and Minnie mouse with a huge queue by a limosine (Apart from the parade). This is not what i expected from a Disney place. The food although is on teh expensive side it is no cheaper than general Paris prices   expect 2.99 Euro for a 500ml bottle of soft drink in and around the park. There were lots of rides not working and the majority for adults so felt this limited our activities. The studios were alot better for older children and adults and would recommend the Horror hotel rides for those that love the scarier rides. As adults we managed to do both parks between 11 and 6.30 with all teh rides we could go on and then settled to watch the parade. The Parade route startes getting busy about 6 so if you want a good spot get there early could see a lot of dissapointed people turning up just before 7 and not getting a viwing space they wanted.The trains are frequent and buying tickets was not an issue.","Negative"
"I get it, it's Disneyland and people are expected to pay a high price just to say they've been there. From the 5 buck Churro, the 10 buck corn dog that takes 30 min in line to the waffle corn ice cream on Main Street that takes another 30 min to get. If you have little ones who are impatient, I suggest going elsewhere. We used to have the annual passes and would come 3 times a week and the lines would be maybe 5 10 min max and have dinner at Napa Rose. Now it doesn't matter what day of the week, people are everywhere around Disneyland. My Kids hate Disneyland simply because the lines are so long and they can't even walk around without getting struck with a stroller. They are 5 and 6 and would rather go to Universal Studios or Legoland than come here.","Neutral"
"We used to live in SoCal and we had park passes for years. It was so fun to go to the parks for however long or short a time we wanted. If it was too crowded we would go play at the playground in DCA or hang out on Tom Sawyer's island.We've lived outside of SoCal for 11 years and decided to drop into the parks before visiting family. We had one day; the day before Thanksgiving. We anticipated crowds but we know these parks very well so we weren't worried. We got one day hopper passes. We were in DCA by 8am and went straight to Radiator Springs FastPass. We got a 10:20am time. *Helpful hint* The single rider line of this ride moves even faster than the FastPass line but since it was our first time on this ride we wanted to sit together.The FastPasses you get are tied to your park ticket so you must scan your park ticket in the FastPass line, not the actual FastPass.What used to be Soarin' over California is now Soarin' over the World and it.is.amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! This was one of my favorite rides anyway and they made it even better!!!!!!!DCA has always been my preferred park. More open space, more play areas for kids, usually less crowded. A better lay out I feel and better food! I don't love that alcohol is served in DCA but there's nothing I can do about that. I'm pretty sure the only place alcohol is served in DL is in Club 33.We caught the noon Frozen performance at the Hyperion in DCA. It was a wonderful break from the heat and standing walking. We did spend time in DL. It was way more crowded and I'm not a big fan of DL but again, we know the park well and we were able to do in 14hrs more than anyone would expect.The fireworks show was cancelled due to winds (this happens more than people realize) which was disappointing because the holiday fireworks show is the best.Big Thunder Mountain is a favorite of ours too and they've upgraded the thunder tunnel which was a delightful surprise! This is the smoothest, most enjoyable ride ever.Our teen was able to use the single rider line on Splash Mountain and Space Mountain. Single Rider options are life saving sometimes!I got my Dole Whip at the Tiki Bar *helpful hint* go into the Tiki Room waiting area and order from that side of the bar. There was a line of at least 30 people waiting in the  street  side of the bar and I walked into the holding area and no one was in line so I was in and out with my Dole Whip in a matter of seconds. Dole Whips are NON DAIRY!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes, I love them.Overall a great experience for our teen who hadn't been since he was 5 years old. He was grateful for parents who knew the park, he was amazed at how the parks transport you to other times and places through the themes and d  cor. We spent 14 straight hours in the parks which was exhausting and we've never done that before but when you only have one day it's what you do.We blew over $100 on food and snacks and drinks. You ARE allowed to bring food and drink into the parks and we did but it wasn't enough. We utilized every drinking fountain we saw to refill water bottles.I don't know how families afford Disney experiences but the place is always packed. Stay for at least 3 days if you can and read a guide book to understand FastPasses, rider switch (a must for parents of small children), and single rider options.As much as I am NOT a fan of Disney, I admit to the magic that can be felt in the parks. And be warned that even though it is  The Happiest Place on Earth  you will see a LOT of meltdowns and unhappy people, ha ha!","Neutral"
"We will be visiting Disneyland in December January for my husbands Big Birthday so I wanted to make it special by ordering him a cake to be sent to a restaurant. I called the (non 1 800 number on their website (714) 781 DINE) to order the cake. I spoke to a young guy and right from the get go he seemed dazed and confused about what should have been a simple transaction. It was about a 30 minute conversation to try to order a very simple cake. I had already waited on hold (long distance) for 45 mins to get through only to have more issues with order. He took all of my information including hotel, name, confirmation   AND my credit card information. He said he would then send me a confirmation email. Well I never did receive an email. I waited two weeks and called back. Same problem again, waited on hold for 30 minutes when finally someone picked up. I went through my whole issue with her and she seemed just as confused. She put me on hold about 6 times for minimum 5 6 minutes while she consulted with someone else. Finally she says there is no record of my order but she will follow through and speak to the hotel and bakery etc and call me back that same day. Surprise, NO call back. Who hires these people??? Why do they all seem to be brand new with no training?? Soooooo frustrating. So third time is the charm, NOT. I call back again today to try to track this order. I spoke to Anita today and the first thing she said was that they don't place orders for hotel delivery that I have to go through the hotel directly...What?? why didn't the first two reps tell me this?? Needless to say I have cancelled the order (that didn't seem to exist) and I will not be doing business with Disney dining anytime soon. I have booked a restaurant from their website but it wouldn't let me make changes to it, I had to call back again (no 1 800 ) to make a simple time change.You would think a company this big would have the best customer service in the world. They don't even have a  feedback  link on their website to email. They really need to go in and clean up their website and make it more user friendly (very confusing in some areas). Another simple solution to placing cake orders is to have an online link to do this yourself. Take out the agent all together then there is NO ROOM for error. COME ON DISNEYLAND, catch up with the times and get a website designer to fix these issues. And get a 1 800 number for your customers.","Negative"
"We paid approx 80 EURO per person to visit this junkyard called euro Disney park in Paris. Firstly the money they charge is a bomb, it is still worthy if you can catch some rides, we opted to go to the Disney studios where it's a mix of some rides and some shows, to my utter surprise most of the rides we so overcrowded that they shut shop for the rides right at 11 am ( you need to take appointments for rides) inspire of we having a fast pass. They proclaim to be well organised and disciplined ( most of Europe thinks so, but far from reality), they need to restrict traffic inflow accordingly so that all who have paid money gets to enjoy the rides. The place is just another shopping mall set to gather some quick bucks from people who are carried away by the Disney branded items kept in the shops. Two rides broke down and just an announcement that we are trying to rectify and nothing came through. To me it's a sham.","Negative"
"Disney park was expensive for the family, but once in you could do all the rides. Wait time for rides was not bad, thing the most was 40 minutes. We also ate at the park. Food was a bit pricey and not very tasty for the value. The fireworks and the parade were fantastic. Disappointed that more of the Disney characters were not out and about amongst the crowds.","Positive"
"I've mentioned before how Disney stopped capping admissions to a reasonable level over the holiday season so visitors could enjoy what remains a wonderful place to visit. Their greed is ruining the place as to have to wait in line for ten minutes whilst in the park before being able to walk   sorry, shuffle   to the next attraction can't be anyone's idea of fun, surely? Of course holiday times will be busy and we expect that. But we don't expect a park that is simply overfull to the extent that in a full day there and despite Fast Passes and front of line access (we completed a questionnaire) we could only do four rides.When a day out at a theme park becomes a test of endurance it's no longer fun and is something to avoid.","Neutral"
"This is our first time visiting the    ghost house    in Disneyland during Halloween. We bought the night ticket and entered Disneyland at 7p.m. We waited for around half an hour to visit each ghost house. The ghost house is not very terrifying; suitable for elder children    it took around 10 15 minutes to walk through the ghost house. The night parade is exactly like its television advertisement. The children were excited but it is not that attractive to adults. Firework at the castle was amazing; it starts at 21:00 every night. The music and firework cooperate to create a wonderful memory for visitors.","Neutral"
"Disneyland Park in Anaheim is the original Disneyland and still my favorite! As always it's clean and very organized. The employees are friendly and courteous. Disneyland is still the greatest fantasyland for not only kids but adults. My kids love it and the rides from Indiana Jones, Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, the Haunted Mansion, the Jungleboat ride to Peter Pans ride are always an adventure into fantasy and fun. Adventureland takes your kids into places they'll never experience in real life, and helps to expand their imagination and experience into lands that they've seen or read about in both books and movies. The price of admission is high, but once your in, you can try to go on everything as many times as you want, and not have to pay for again, and all amusement parks are pretty costly today no matter where you go. The problem are the crowds and getting on all of the rides you want to go on. The speed passes help some but even with those you are limited by only being able to come back between certain times and those lines get crowded too. Average wait times on the most popular rides on a crowded day can be 2 hours or more, and even with speed passes can be up to an hour. Disneyland would be able to manage this better if they limited the number of admission tickets per day, so that the crowds are not so massive and this would certainly cut down on those unbearable in many cases, several hours wait time. They oversale too many tickets per day in my opinion. Certainly half of your day consists of waiting in lines, so prepare to be there all day, and start early! The ideal way is to have a couple of days set aside for the park since its very hard to ride on everything because of the wait time. Also week days are less crowded than weekends and holidays are extrememly crowded. It helps for if you have several in your group, so that one designated person waits in line for a popular ride while the others go on another ride, then return later. The food there is also costly, and even lunch for 3 will cost you $60 $80, but it's not bad for park food. California Adventure next door is a great addition too, and the price is included with your Disneyland Park admission, so that helps make this trip worth it. The Tower of Terror is an unbelievable ride into this Twilight Zone series episode of a haunted Hotel, with great graphic animation of spirits, an unbelievable hotel set, and elevator ride and drop that will make you scream (great at night), and is definitely worth the wait, and the new Cars ride is also an incredible and fun adventure into Radiator Falls for your kids. The kids love these parks and even I have a certain nostalgic feeling, remembering when I came as a kid 35 years ago with my parents. The memories are cherished forever and your kids will cherish them as well. You can't go wrong here.","Positive"
"We have been to Disneyland many times and never had a problem until this trip. I have Rheumatoid arthritis and while I may look  normal  it is very difficult to stand for any period of time. I guess they have a new policy where you have to convince the person that you have a disability. I guess she felt that I wasn't disabled enough as she said that if I was unwilling to have my husband push me around in a wheelchair I was going to have a difficult time. Well she was right I had a difficult time and ended up leaving hours early. Good thing my children are old enough to stay themselves otherwise the whole family would have been disappointed. We will be spending our money on other vacations as this will be our last trip to Disneyland.","Negative"
"In all fairness, We did visit on Dec. 30, 31st. The park was over the top crowded. We had an awesome ViP tour guide from Stone VIP that worked the fast pass lines like a champ and that was a life saver. Crowds were unreal after 4pm, they block the park off with one walkways and close exits during the fireworks. If you don't plan well you are stuck inside the park for 2 hours with no way out except pushing your way through massive crowde. The quick service food is good and plenty of options.","Neutral"
"took my kids here many many times could not wait to bring grandson and I qm here to tell you this is not Disneyland, it is a theme park that has its hand out. They need to start limiting the amount of people it is soi uncomfortable, they should tell people thsat since they are coming in the week they will be shorted three hours each day, will not see paraded and will not see fireworks but they WILL PAY the same price!!! They are not happy, they are rude especially on the monorail where being in a wheel chair I was mortified thank you for that we aren't uncomfortable enough. the food offered had Dropped by about 90 points it is bad so bring your own you will be in a giant grease pit if you don't and you will pay dearly for It too when a hot dog is 9 dollars! the nicest cast members were at the haunted house kudos to all of them!! I was sadden by something my parents took me to in 55, and many years after, then I took my kids all their childhood and they went as teenagers and my first trip with grandson and I was disgusted and embarrassed it is not walts park any more.","Negative"
"Disneyland was short staffed. Security only had 2 lines open. Maintenance couldn't keep up on broken rides. Half of Fantasyland wasn't open for magic morning. Hours were 10am 8pm even though the whole park was packed to the point that parking lots were closed. Until Disneyland can get a clue that THERE IS NO OFF SEASON, then I will stop attending. I don't need to pay that much for my family to be thrown whatever scraps disney decides to throw me in September...even though I am paying the same full price as July folks.","Negative"
"For a good experience, be there EARLY!! Once the general public starts appearing, it sucks. It's too crowded, little children everywhere, sometimes unsupervised. Not the best place for a couple to go out on a date at lol. If I had to go again, I'll make sure to bring my own snacks and drinks as everything is super expensive inside. Idk, not my favorite amusement park to visit :","Negative"
"Most of the rides were pretty usual rides found in most parks. Adults will find the park boring, the kids will like most of the rides.","Neutral"
"Me and My Husband Loved Disney Land. The Spectacular Parades and Shows during Christmas time was the best ever. The Whole Park was decorated for Christmas . The fireworks and shows were themed by the 10th Anniversary Park Celebration,One day is enough to cover the park , if you come early and plan your day well.Elsa & Anna Lit the Center Christmas Tree after a mini performance.Loved it. Will Come Back someday when i have kids  3","Positive"
"We were looking forward to our visit to Disneyland Paris, especially having been to Disneyworld Florida a few years ago. To say we were disappointed is putting it mildly. We were lucky enough to have wonderful weather. Our hotel The Santa Fe  was clean, comfortable and the staff were helpful. The rides were fun, the parade and fireworks were not to be missed, but where were the characters? It was not our idea of fun, to queue for up to two hours a day, to get a pass, that gave us a time to queue again for half an hour to spend five minutes with one princess. There were characters in Disney studios from 12.00 2.00, if you didn't mind the pushing and shoving to get your photo taken with the nearest character. The main reason for going to a Disney park are the characters, take them away and you have a moderate theme park. My advice is try to save the money and go to Florida.","Neutral"
"Disneyland is indeed the most magical place in the world. It was our family's first time to go to disneyland and the closing fireworks display was definitely worth waiting for. Being in disneyland makes one believe that anything is possible, even for my parents who are already above 60. My birthday celebration here was definitely a blast!","Positive"
"This was my 2nd time there. I bought the combo entrance from a website 'klook' which was inclusive of the entrance fee & a meal. As there are 13 of us which some were muslims, the only halal cafe will be the one at the Adventureland...& it was closed on that day. It wasnt stated on the Disneyland website or neither am I been notified or been highlighted that the cafe will be closed on that day (when i actually hv to specify the date i am going upon booking). We hv to search high & low for a halal cafe & was given ONLY 2 choices of meal which indeed was lousy taste. Some of the games were closed & the rest does not meet my expectations. So as the parade too...very boring.","Negative"
"Had a good time at the park. The park has many rides for all ages and although it was crowded as expected, we were still able to do those rides we wanted. The park didn't feel cramped as in the case of California Adventures.","Positive"
"Disneyland is a special place. I would say though that this one is a little light on for attraction. Space Mountain was closed while there and they are due to open Toyland a new part of the park in a week or two which I think they do need in order to provide more to do. Wasn't really too busy although we did attend a weekday. Staff are very good and things are well run and organised. The place could probably do with some more food options. ","Neutral"
"Good park a lot of fun but could do with some updates. Think the park needs at least one more big thrill ride. Fire work display at park closing was amazing definitely recommend. ","Positive"
"Arrived on tuesday 5th march my self my husband daughter her husband and three grandson's 10 4 and 10 month's, third time in paris plus twice in florida, after a long journey we arrived at the park which was full to capacity french holiday travel company didnt tell us,but still we made the best of it .20 years celebrations and it looks 20 years old very tired not well kept pavements cracked and broken everywhere, paintwork needs doing everywhere, buzz lightyear pizza planet closed, snow white ride closed, pirates of the Caribbean closed ,12 euros per day to hire stroller, back lot tram ride closed, 2.99 euros for small bottle of water everything was mega expensive queues were massive 90 mins for a 4 min ride on peter pan which was completely in the dark where was london , the place needs a complete over haul all the rides need refurbishment apart from the very new ones parades brilliant most of 'cast and crew' unhelpful some nice not many the light show on the castle fantastic but 3 hot dogs in stale buns and 3 bottles of water cost 26.97 euros absolutely disgraceful disney get a grip and lower your prices you are exploiting those who have made you what you are, children, and the parents who bring them to your park, my family wont be back also people smoking everywhere .","Negative"
"I went on multiple weekdays. Still felt overcrowded. Sometimes at the entrance they asked me to go through the metal detector, other times not. I have to admit to being disappointed with my first visit to Disneyland. It's showing its age. Too many attractions were closed, including the monorail.Indiana Jones ride was good. It has a single rider line, which involves two elevator rides, I kid you not. I almost got lost in there. I saw Tangled and Beauty and the Beast, which I both liked. And I saw a nice song and dance show at Fantasyland Theatre. And the Nemo submarine ride was good.If you have a Magic Morning entry you might want to use it for Peter Pan ride as that queue builds up fast. Bus 20 is a free shuttle to the Toy Story parking lot, which is worth taking if your hotel is near there, on South Harbor Blvd.","Neutral"
"Overall it's a magical place but there are 4 areas for significant improvement in my opinion: 1) weekends (especially sundays) are far too busy. numbers must be limited or controlled. we were there on a sunday in mid september and the crowds and waiting times were unbearable.2)they need to improve the food options. Almost all restaurants are self service with more queuing. Most restaurants serve the same thing (burgers, fast food, etc.) after queuing all morning for rides it would be good to sit down and be served a slow meal at your table. 3) I'd expect more disney characters to be visible around the park and more frequency of parades. There is just one big parade at 17:00 daily and a train with the characters going round on the hour. 4) they need to find ways to reduce waiting time. Fast pass is a good idea but needs to be rolled out on all rides and when I tried it the machines were faulty so it was touch n go. Alternatively they could make airing more fun by having characters go round the queues and entertain the kids.","Neutral"
"We were staying 30 minutes away for a conference, and decided to check out Disneyland since it was so close. They say October is the off season, but it is still crowded!! A lot of the rides we wanted to ride were down for maintenance, so it was pretty disappointing. Space Mountain was decked out for Halloween, and was by far my fave ride. It was interesting to see the differences between the same rides offered at DisneyWorld and Disneyland. We did not get the park hopper pass to include California Adventure... kind of wish we would have just gone in to that park over Disneyland... newer rides and alcoholic beverages. At least I can check Disneyland (the original) off my bucket list. I highly prefer DisneyWorld, hands down!!","Neutral"
"I still like the theme parks and I am 53! I give an average b c of the long lines, the prices of food drink and usually some of the good exhibits are closed. I would visit in spring fall, it is to hot in the summer.","Neutral"
"We went there with some family members who have kids, first there are many options for booking the ticket. We book the Disneyland park since we have kids and was only for 1 day. Only one park is more than enough for 1 day. The parking is $18. Then you take a shuttle bus to the park. You can bring your own food and drinks to the park.I recommend getting sunscreen when you visit the park. Most of the rides were for kids and as we are adults, we didn't enjoy the rides. Last thing, don't forget to use your fast pass tickets which save you time. The machine locks you from getting another ticket unless 2hours passes after using the first ticket. So try to use it once you get in.","Positive"
"Our grandaughter loved the magic and we made sure that she enjoyed her first ever trip abroad. Yes, we knew that it was going to be exensive and we were prepared for that. What we did not expect was the lack of customer care when things were not as they should have been. A worrying aspect was that the pool at the New York Hotel was not suitable for young (or old) novice swimmers as it was the same depth throughout. We have let Eurodisney Paris know about our concerns, not to seek any financial redress, but to make them aware of the our numerous concerns. Despite sending our letter in August, we have not had a written response. Again, a customer service issue.","Negative"
"I heard rave reviews and lot of great stuff about disney land from my family & friends from across the world. The expectations were sky high but I would to be frank in my assessment that its a wonderful amusement park but dont think its the best. Rides were good but many of them closed. The fast track option is not well informed and if you miss it can end up in long queues everywhere. Not everything was bad offcourse we had our share of fun and the grandoise was there to see. Smoking was everywhere this is something that has to be curbed and some serious rules made as with all other public places across the world.","Neutral"
"I was born in HB in the 1960's and my folks would take us to Disneyland at least once a year. My husband and I visited the coast in HB last week for a few days and we also went to Disneyland. He had never been there. We both really enjoyed it, we went just after school started so the wait times for the rides were not at all long waits and we were there on a weekday. My favorite ride has always been Pirates of the Carribean and my husband said that was his favorite also. We also enjoyed riding the monorail for a little scenic sit down break around the park. Out of all the times I've been to Disneyland, that was the first time I ever rode that ride lol. I was really disappointed though because the Haunted Mansion was closed :( That was also one of my favorites and that's all I talked about to my husband for several days before we got there. That was minor though compared to the rest of the park. A great time once again at the Happiest place on earth!","Positive"
"Seems that scammers in the form of teenagers actually prey on tourists going to Disneyland Paris at train stations, offering to help purchase tickets. You arrive at Disney and realise that you actually bought a kids ticket (you will not understand anything 'cos everything is in French) and have to pay a penalty of more than 30 Euros pax to get out of the station. This is a real bummer for many tourists. The park itself was average with the usual rides, the area is bigger than the Hong Kong park but crowded and everything was in French. Happy that I managed to see my favourite Chip and Dale though!","Neutral"
"Hong Kong Disneyland is small and frankly the rides are very boring and limited.The wait is horrendous, no air conditioning and you'd need to queue up for at least 60 minutes in the hot sun. The crowds are mostly from mainland China, and most of them would probably try to jump queue, if not they'd stand really close behind you whilst you're waiting in line for no apparent reason.Even if you're not participating in any of the rides, make sure to prepare yourself with an umbrella, hat, water and sunscreen. The waiting areas are not sheltered and you could be left sitting in the scorching heat.The good thing about Hong Kong Disneyland, is that the rides have three languages. English, Cantonese and Mandarin.","Neutral"
"Always wanted to go to Disneyland when I was a kid (born in 1956), but that was not to be. Have been to Disneyland several times as my daughter lives in California and we go when we visit her. I actually prefer Disneyland to Disney World as it does not get oppressively humid as it does in Florida, and Disney World is sooooooo big!!","Positive"
"Went to Disneyland on 31st December, 2013. After going to Disney World in Orlando two years earlier, we were excited to experience the Disney magic all over again.We knew it would be busy as it was New Year's Eve but we were told when we arrived that if the park reached capacity, no more tickets would be sold. This was to ensure an enjoyable and comfortable experience for all. I don't know what the park's capacity is, but I have never experienced such a crowded place in my life. It was intense. ProsFireworks were goodIt was easy to get to the park from the car park   via shuttle or a short walk. ConsLines for rides were up to 200 minutes. Long lines for the bathroom.Restaurants required bookings (but this was not advertised)Lines for 'take away' style food were very long, limited places to sit and eat this food. Our 'fast pass' to one ride was available to us between 12 1am. We got the ticket issued at 4pm.Hard to move around the park due to crowding but also due to ropes cutting off access points between areas. We felt like cattle getting moved around, aimlessly going nowhere. The iconic castle was very much the 'poor cousin' to the Disney world version.We left at 1am, hoping to miss the 12am rush after the fireworks, it took over 1 hour to get out of the car park   no Disney staff to direct the traffic. I appreciate that New Year's is a busy time, but our Disney world experience two years earlier was the week of Christmas and it was excellent. If you have a choice between Disney world and Disneyland. It's Orlando Disney all the way!","Negative"
"If you every been to or intend to visit Japan Disney, I say can give this a miss! Not only the services are bad, the food, the rides and even the crowd here are terrible. I have nothing against China Tourists, but it looks like they behave extremely badly in theme parks, especially when the staff don't give a s* too. I was pushed, queue cut, spitted beside and even saw some smoking in toilet. People aside, only kids may not noticed the rides are not as good, it seems small and does not have the  magical feel .However, I find the meal at Enchanted Garden Resturant (we stayed here) though expensive but was enjoyable.","Negative"
"We bought the one day two parks(Disneyland studios and Disneyland magic kingdom) ticket as we had less time, but actually this one day is too too short to enjoy these parks. I think one day one park should be minimum time kept for enjoying these parks. As you enter one of these parks, don't forget to take the guide booklet available at the entrance in different languages. It clearly tells you what all activities are available, wots their type and what are must to visit. The Disneyland studios offers more indoor activities and magic kingdom offers more of out door activities. Every minute of visit and every thing is enjoyable. One actually forgets the outer world as entering these parks. The live characters, the movies, the buildings and their textures, architects, the themes of these parks are marvellous and fantastic. More activities in magic kingdom are in the after noon so if some one buys one day two parks ticket, then must go to studios in the morning and spent the later part of the day in magic kingdom. The characters parade at 1730 Hours and Fire and laser show at 2030 Hours, both at the magic kingdom are the best part and should not be missed. One must go and occupy the good seats for better view of these two activities well before the start times. Over all Disneyland Paris is the most enjoyable activity when you are in Paris. Disneyland Paris is in zone 5 of Paris metro zone and costs 7.20 Euro per person one way if travelling from zone 1 (central Paris). Its convenient and takes almost one hour to reach the Disneyland metro station from central Paris.","Positive"
"Just back from a 5 day stay. Arrived on the sunday and wasnt too busy but as the week progressed it became more busy due to french half term.Arrived early with extra magic hours and queued for 1 hour to meet Donald Duck...never again! Chip and Dale queue not so long.Queues for rides very long. Even a long queue just to get fast passes.People still rude, still barge into you. Im afraid its mainly the French who have no manners it seems. Why stand in front of me when im clearly trying to take a photograph??? Even when politely asked to move in French!!! Lots of walking and it can be exhausting. Wouldnt come again for Halloween as too busy.","Neutral"
"Being Disney mad I have just returned for my latest trip to Disneyland Paris and have come back somewhat not full of the usual Disney magic I usually have. I feel this for a number of reasons. First The wait times seem to be getting longer and longer, which seems to be due to how slow cast members seem to be at loading up rides. I have never found this to be an issue, but this trip it just seem to take forever for rides to start once your on them. The next reason for the lack of magic seems to be how offen rides seem to be breaking down. This issue is made worst by the fact that you have just waited such a long time to get to the front and then can't get on the ride. I know this sometimes can't be helped, but maybe when this does happen the cast members could give those already at the front of the line a special walk straight on ticket for when the ride is up and running again, rather than you having to fast pass or wait in line again. Some of the rides could do with some TLC as the little details are being lost. The next issue I found was the lack of interaction with the characters it now offers. You never see any just walking about and even if you do they won't stop, The meet and greets that do go on have such long waiting times, which is made worst by the French who don't seem to understand the whole system of waiting their turn. This issue could be helped by Disney if they had a cast member looking after the line. It's not really the magic you expect from meeting mickey etc if you have waited over an hour and had to have words with someone about pushing in. The lack of character meals is not great as this is always worth paying for to avoid the issues of the meet and greets. I visit Disney lots and have really come home feeling very flat for the first time as I am normally buzzing for weeks after and i'm not feeling the need to rush to book another trip. Over all I feel the place has lost what made it so magical.","Neutral"
"I have been to Disneyland Paris twice before in the peak period of August during the traditional French holidays and it was, as I expected,busy. No complaints, I chose that time so no moaning if it is busy.However,this year went in the first week of August and it was absolutely jam packed with people.I mean queues of frustrated people everywhere...long queues at the rides,long queues at the toilets,long queues at the food outlets.I have never experienced so many people in a such a confined area.I cannot believe there are no safety limits in place,but it certainly seemed like they were squeezing as many people in as possible.I was lucky to get on three rides for my 60 odd euros...!! Value for money..no chance..!!Fast Pass.. what a joke.. machines not working and told to come back in three hours on average to get on..!!15 Euros to park as the car as well..this was my last time at DP never ever going back... if you want a day of ignorant people,pushing,jostling,smoking..fill yer boots at Disneyland Paris.. me I'm off to Parc Asterix..100 times better..","Negative"
"I expected the prices to be high and queues to be long but not to the extent it was.Most queues were an average of 1 hour, even for small rides. The queues were along the street as there was not enough room for the amount of people. I don't think disney should let so many people in the park at once. If you have been to Orlando disney, I would not reccommend trying Paris.","Negative"
"Great place, obviously. I know it   s difficult but the queues are a factor to consider. 50 minuets at Thunder mountain for example. Lots of people using fast pass, but at   60 for a few days, it is an item. And this slows down the queue for everyone else. Would also like to see beer tents knocking around for the occasional refreshments.That said, it   s an excellent attraction. The youngsters loved it, and so did the adults. So much going on and lots of security in place.","Positive"
"This was our fourth visit and once again we had a great time. The park is great, even if the weather doesnt hold up, and it represents a great place to visit within sensible reach of the UK.","Positive"
"We were lucky to arrive on the last night of the Christmas period so we watched the parade and the illumination show. The next day was back to normal Disney, the parade was great and closing fireworks just beautiful. Rides are great, wish there were a few more thrill rides but what is there is good. We lunched at plaza gardens using our meal package vouchers, it's a buffet so great with kids,we never booked and we never had a problem getting in. We are around 2pm, maybe was busier earlier. Plenty of toilets around park and drinking water fountains. Take empty bottles and fill up there as drinks are expensive. Quite a few attractions close in January I suppose as its quiet so the best time to update them. My only criticism is that I expected characters to be walking around the parks but if you want to meet then there are certain times and you gave to queue for meet and greet. Would have thought that there would have been more just generally walking around . The castle is spectacular when u see it for the first time , you can go inside but it's nothing exciting. There are shops everywhere and it's difficult to not give in and get swept up in the whole Disney bubble. Gotta buy some Minnie ears tho .Brilliant holiday","Positive"
"It's overcrowded and it can be hot. Your feet will hurt more than you thought possible. It's pricey, and the lines are so so long. That being said, it's Disneyland, and that alone is worth the the trip. Everyone participates in  magic morning,  so go early and expect to wait. You can get a lot in if you are an early riser  but there will be some wait for most rides. You can get Fast Passes, but not for nearly as many rides as Disney World. We really enjoyed the Indiana Jones ride and the older  dark Disney  rides. I wasn't able to get on Peter Pan  the line was always at least 45 minutes. The Nemo ride is horrible and not worth the long wait.","Neutral"
"We went to Disney park with a total of 6 people, 3 adults and 3 children of ages 13, 6 and 3. The queues were huge and the food and drinks totally overpriced! We managed to go through a few attractions due to the large amount of people and the huge waiting times for each attraction. The 20 year anniversary parade was not anything special, I expected more for such an overpriced place.","Negative"
"I'm a Disney fanatic so this was really fun for me. There are rides for people of all ages interests so no one had to feel left out. I participated in the  Walking in Walt's Disneyland Footsteps  Tour and ate at many restaurants including Blue Bayou (my fave) and River Belle Terrace. Hope to visit again. ","Positive"
"disney land paris should be renamed disney shopping centre paris. i was there 18th to 22nd of may 2014 and the rides had massive cues and if you wanted to see a character the cue was at least an hour i cued for 11 2 hours to see rapunzel if you want to see princesses it more than 2 hours just to get the booking to see them. the food is awful and the merchandise was shoddy and very expensive. a lot of the rides were closed due to refurbishing and others broke down whilst in the cue. the only thing that was magical was the light show but that started at 10.30pm so it was difficult keeping kids awake. this was my second visit and i will not be going for a third as it is far too commercialised its all about spending the fun has been taken out of it, i was very disappointed.","Negative"
"We were just in Disneyland Paris on a Monday in August. The whole experience was a disappointment from beginning to end. To get into the park took at least 45 minutes, in three very disorganized queues first to go through security, then to get tickets, then to get into the park. The main problem with Disney is that it's far too crowded, at least in the summer. The park is much smaller that its Florida counterpart, so with so many people milling about it's hard just to maneuver the walkways. Obscenely long lines. And nearly every line had a line jumper! Park not as clean as in Florida, and the staff certainly not as friendly. Just before 6:00 p.m. my husband waited in line for fish and chips at Toad Hall restaurant. When he arrived at the counter, at 5:58, the manager literally closed the door in his face and said,  We're closed.  He was the last one in line and they could have easily closed the door after serving him. We had a crappy sandwich for dinner someplace else instead. Now the the good: the rides were all fun, especially It's a small World, the Fairy Tale boat ride, Pirates of the Caribbean. And the parade at 7:15 was great. But nearly all lines were 30 minutes or more; we averaged only one ride per hour. However, although I did not enjoy the day, my kids definitely did. They have good memories, so it wasn't a complete waste. I'll never go back to DPL. Stick to Disney in Florida or other locales.","Negative"
"Our favorite was the Astro Blasters...loved by both parents, our 22 year old son, and 6 year old son! Be sure to eat at the Blue Bayou Restaurant near the Pirates of the Caribbean. We enjoyed our 25th Anniversary dinner there. Well worth the price of admission!","Positive"
"My husband and I recently returned from a long weekend in Paris. Since we were ahead of schedule, we thought we would catch some Euro Disney Magic! What we caught was very long lines, Fast Pass booths closed, several attractions closed, too many restaurants cafes and too few attractions. The staff was terrible at loading attraction cars   normally, you line up and they try to fill all the seats, right? 20% of the cars that went by were empty. Also, in six hours, we did not see ONE charachter! It was unbelievable considering that it was so busy. At best, it was lousy. If you are an American, you will most likely hate it. Another poster said the entrance was beautiful, but it went downhill FAST after that. I agree. Also, be careful if you take the RER out to Disney from Paris. Be sure your fare is correct before you arrive as you insert your RER ticket for entry into the Park. If your fare is short, you are locked out and you have to buy a  violators ticket  for 25 Euro. Europa Park in Germany is 10 X better.","Negative"
"My girlfriend and I visited Disney Land Paris on the 2nd January to celebrate the new year, and to be honest, we were left extremely disappointed and we left to go home a lot earlier than we intended to. So where do I begin      .We arrived at Opera at 8.25am on the morning for the bus to depart at 8.40am. The bus was nowhere to be seen and there were 2 other couples who we did not know also waiting for the bus that did not arrive. So the Shuttle bus was either extremely early and left without us even though we were on time, or did not turn up at all. We then all had to pay more money to get the train to Disney Land (which is a much better idea anyway). When we eventually arrived at the park we were looking for somewhere to eat in the morning but no restaurants were open and the only place that was open for breakfast was for hotel guests only. We then walked around the park and proceeded to try and get food from various vendors   stalls in the park but they were all closed, empty, or out of service. We did find 1 coffee stand in in Discovery Land but the Milk was off and sour so I had to throw it away which was another waste of money. So we did not get food until 11.45am in one of the fast food places at the back of the park opening for lunch time. Starving! A number of rides were also out of order for a while (thunder mountain, Indiana jones, toy story and others) which meant there was not a lot else to choose from for adults in the main park, and since the other rides were out of order for an unknown time it was impossible to get on the other decent rides because the queues were so big! So we did not go on a lot of rides during our time there. We were actually queuing for Toy Story for 20 minutes then an announcement came on saying that it was out of service due to a technical fault, we waited another 10 minutes before we decided to leave because no progress was made, but when we left the queue the lady at the gate then said you can go back the ride is back on but by that time we already lost our place in the queue and it was still another 45 minutes wait. No announcement was made that the ride was back on for the people waiting and we were very annoyed that we wasted so much time. So we moved on. On two separate occasions we queued up to get our picture taken with the Disney Characters in the park, the lines were not that big so we were optimistic. But both times a member of staff told us that no more pictures were allowed to be taken so we didn   t even get a chance to get our picture taken. This would not normally be a huge issue, but on top of everything else it was starting to take the mickey (no pun intended). Due to the number of issues, lack of good service, lack of rides available and general poor quality of rides we left the park at 5pm feel very unsatisfied. We were hoping to use our Express ticket to get the bus home at 8pm (since the 1st one never showed on the time stated) but we could not last another 3 hours in the park after being left frustrated. We had a magnificent time in Paris in general, but I am sad to say Disney was certainly the only low point. I am astonished this cost me   162.00 in total and I hope in future if we decide to visit again that the experience is a lot more enjoyable.","Negative"

"Long lines, long wait and wall to wall people is what to expect. While I have been to Disneyland several times as I lived only 10 miles from it, the increase in prices and the long waits seems overdone. You just don't get what you used to in the early days. While there were a couple of new rides that I have not been on I would say Disneyland is only a once in 10 year visit.","Neutral"
"This is the most appalling place! Everywhere you go is heaving   you have to queue for absolutely everything. Anything to eat or drink costs a fortune. You are pushed and jostled and herded around like animals. Te parades are lovely though if you can see and don't get pushed out of the way. It is positively awful, terrible value for money and everywhere you go you feel you are being ripped off   whether that is in the shops, at the kiosks, booking extra shows, queuing endlessly for rides or eating   drinking in the restaurants.","Negative"
"Visited Disneyland in April 2006. Good rides but it's to crowded. Using the fastpass shortens the lines but it can be hard to find the fastpass machines. This place is more for the younger kids, teenagers demands more thrilling rides. I presume it's a very nice place in the evening. Saw the fireworks from nearby California Adventure and it looked really good.","Neutral"

But it completely lacks charm or ability to draw you in   and the reason is the disinterest and often, plain rudeness of the staff. They act as if they could not care less whether you are having a good time or not. Obvious opportunities to help give information or smile or even not look fed up.. ! The whole place seems understaffed, and empty of atmosphere. There were some good friendly staff, but they were outnumbered. That that was our impression of the french staff at our hotel, in the station, at the airport. Any query.. minimal information was given, even though it was obvious that extra information would help enormously. For example, at the station, we asked about getting to the airport by TGV  it turned out that there wasn't any for another 3 hours. Even though the information staff knew we wanted to get to the airport, he information staff never mentioned that there were alternative  slow  trains. Or buses. Or taxis. It took three different visits to the information desks to about the next option as we figured them out for ourselves. It's as if the whole approach is to provide minimum information even though it's obvious that the wider request hasn't been dealt with. This is one of several examples. In our hotel, we were checked into a dirty room that hadn't been cleaned. When we went back to reception, we politely told them, but they treated us as if it was our fault, and certainly no trace of an apology. We had a good time because we were happy to be there, but certainly not because of any charm of the people. And don't get me started at the relentless Disney merchandising or bad food...","Neutral"
"visited this park during rosebowl time only because it was an outing offered to our group, which was a high school band. i expected crowdes but not the gazillion pople we were faced with. It was hard to even walk thru the park and in the end we gave up trying and took the train back to the entrance. The characters were'nt really visible and the staff did not trade any pins with the children. The lines were beyond long so my advice is if you go please do so in an off peak season disney here in cali need to step up their customer service as they lag sorely behind orlando (go there instead). i didnt have high expectations since we had no little kids in our group but it would have been nice to be able to at least get on its a small world Geez!","Negative"
"What a waste of money and dissappointing visit.Disneyland Paris   cold and rainy and staffed by miffed looking Parisians. Wheres the magic?!Thunder Mountain was closed, the disney castle (and many other attractions) shrouded in scaffolding and tarps. Dreadful customer service. Long queues regularly being queue jumped by French, German and Russians who  don't do queues . Only a few attractions available on the Fastpass system.Dirty streets and everyone smoking!Just don't do it.Save up and go to Disney in Florida or LA...... so much better in every way.","Negative"
"HK Disneyland might be smaller by size compared to other Disneyland   s but it sure don   t have less to see. We were on a Saturday, normally that   s a no no for any kid friendly places but there was little to no line... till after 2pm. After that I had no ideal where all those people came from. Even with the lines (mostly 15 20min wait) we saw almost everything. We missed a few thing because the timing plus we had a child with us, so that don   t help with timing. Over all we had a great time and what I think the best part is that since the park is smaller in size there was less walking to go from place to place. (lol)","Positive"
"Greedy Rat!!! Mickey really jacked up the ticket prices this time! $92 One Day One Park Adult...SWEET JEEZUS!!!$86 One Day One Park Child...at least I don't have one of these$16 Parking ...SERIOUSLY!!!?And what happened to the SoCal 2 Fer pass?Ah well, I guess when Walt Disney envisioned Disneyland, he only meant it for rich kids anyway. Maybe we'll swing by again in 2014...maybe...if we can afford it!","Neutral"
"We enjoyed our visit to Disneyland but won't come again. MAJOR crowds at all times of the day night and super long waits for rides. We spoke with a few employees who basically said that there's no longer any real  off season  and it's like this most of the time. Most of the characters were great, really interactive and we had fun. The exception was Darth Vader, he was a real jerk, basically refusing to allow us to have our pictures taken separately. It happened that he was the first character that we saw so it almost made us not bother with the rest. I'm glad we did though, because the rest were really great, especially Tigger, Eeyore and Pooh!","Negative"
"Went with children aged 12 and 15 and had a good time but this park needs updating and it was a shame that some of the attractions were closed E.g. Indiana Jones and the Haunted House. We loved Buzz Lightyear, Space Mountain (now called something to do with Star Wars ), the railroad coaster. Pirates of the Caribbean looks v old. We enjoyed it   s a small world for old times sake (a real Disney institution!). Food is crazy expensive and not very nice but do take drinks bottles in an re full at water fountains near the loos. And take snacks for the queues. In all, fine for a day or do but no longer with older children!","Neutral"
"We have been to Disneyland many, many times. This last visit was the worst. For $160 per ticket, one should be able to ride more than 4 5 rides a day. The crowds were horrendous. Thinking that it may have been close to capacity. The fast pass system is a broken system. The passes are dispersed and  sold out  at the beginning of the day, and the returns allow too many people to use fast pass. This makes the wait times even longer.Hoping that this is our last Disney trip.","Negative"
"I love Disneyland, and ever trip is just as special as the first visit. Always clean and beautiful. My only compliant would be actually be against some of the inconsiderate patrons with their enormous strollers that mow you down at any given chance. Please people not all of us that enjoy disney, have children. And those of you who have half a sense to watch where your going, I thank you.","Positive"
"Unbelievable crowds. Extremely long waiting times for rides. Every shop selling the same over priced mouse ears but still worth a ONE day visit.","Neutral"
"Who doesn't love Disney? I was able to go to Disney in US so I have some sort of idea what to expect like kiddie rides and the very long lines, overpriced food, the parade in the afternoon and of course the fireworks. Of course there's gonna be a significant difference but still, Disney brings out the kid inside of you.","Neutral"
"We have visited Disneyland Paris a few times now, but sadly our most recent visit will be our last.The park felt dated and shabby, the staff didn't seem to want to be there and it's horrendously expensive, even for an awful cup of tea. If you visit my advice would be to take a flask and your own food into the park for lunch. There is a very good Auchan supermarket 5 mins away at Val d'europe shopping centre. The bus or train will take you there. It will save you a lot of money. I think the biggest disappointment this time was the meet the Princesses attraction next to 'it's a small world'. My daughter adores all the Disney Princesses and we decided on our last day to meet them all (or so we thought). The attraction opens at 10am but we started to queue at 9.30 and at this time there was already a huge queue, we should have been waiting at 9am. When the doors opened at 10am we had another wait for over an hour. When we were finally at the front of the queue, we were told that there were 2 princesses there behind a screen but we could only see one princess and in our case it would be Aurora. We weren't given a choice. If we wanted to see another princess we would have to queue again (at least another hour and a half!) and there were no guarantees as to who that would be. My daughter was so upset as we expected to see lots of princesses. We were ushered in to see Aurora for all of 1  2 minutes and a professional Disney photographer took photos, we were then told to leave where they then try to sell you the pictures which are incredibly expensive. So beware and take your own camera with a flash! This is just one example of the many ways Disney try to exploit you as parents, they really don't care about the feelings of your little ones. To watch my daughter go from excited to crestfallen was horrible.","Negative"
"There is a good reason why the commercials on The Disney Junior Channel show Walt Disney World and not Disneyland.This review is for both the Disneyland Park as well as the Disney California Adventure Park. I couldn't discern one park from the other. We had the same lame overpriced experience in both parks.Some people that are part of the Disney cult (that is the ones wearing the overpriced Mickey Mouse Ears and t shirts) that will probably be appalled by this review. But I can honestly say that I absolutely couldn't wait to leave the park each day (on a 2 day ticket). If I was given free tickets and vacation time to visit the park I wouldn't go back.The best way to describe the park is: 1. start with Disney World 2. shrink it to a fraction of the size 3. add more people and fewer attractions 4. add a fair number of homeless people outide the gate5. charge more for the same quality hotels.It's a great experience if you want to wait an hour and half in the Mickey Mouse house to see Mickey for 1 minute. There was absolutely no indication outside the Mickey Mouse house of how long the wait would be (when there were indications of the length of the queue they were way off). We waited in line about 30 minutes for a 3 minute kiddie train ride. Even the caurosel had a 10 minute wait. There was a 40 minute wait to be seated in overpriced cafe   so my family opted for 2 lemonades, 2 pretzels, and a hotdog for $29.  They do offer the 'Fast Pass' which is a good option for the more popular attractions. Unfortunately, this option is not available for most of the toddler attractions.This was my first (and last) trip to Disneyland. Because I've been to Disney World in Orlando many times the comparisons are inevitable.I'm not a Disney person. I first went to Walt Disney World in Orlando in peak season(as part of a sports team visiting the area) when I was 17 and I didn't understand all the fuss. I preferred Busch Gardens, Six Flags and (what were then) local places like Hershey Park. I'd give the Magic Kindom a B . Epcot was more to my liking   probably a B  and I'd give MGM studios a B. BTW   I had a better experience at Universal Studios versus any of the Disney Parks. Over the years, I've been back to Walt Disney World for conferences and such. I like it but don't love it. However, it's superior to Disneyland.On top of it all, Disneyland is a total rip off. $568 for a 2 day pass for 2 adults and 1 child (and that wasn't a park hopper pass with AAA discount). Once you add the price of the hotel for 3 days (about $900 with tax) the 2 days at Disney costs $1500 (prior to food and transportation). BTW   the Marriott Hotel was actually the best part of the stay.A good family vacation? Standing in line for 30 minutes for a 1.5 3.0 minute ride?Not for us. Yosemite is a good family vacation. Sequoia is a good family vacation. Hawaii is a good family vacation.Sitting in traffic is preferable to Disneyland. In either case, not much is happening most of the day. At least when I'm sitting in traffic I have air conditioning and music.Fortunately, we went to Catalina Island after Disney. We spent much less money. We ate better food. We got to see live wild Bison which is much more exciting than seeing someone dressed up in a mouse costume.","Negative"
"Having been a few times to Disney in Florida we turned up waiting for the magic to begin. What we found is that yes on entry the usual excitement was there but as the day progressed we started missing the special Disney moments.The rides are basically the same ones as those we had ridden before perhaps just called something different. There were a couple of different rides but nothing outstanding. All this could have been forgiven but the park is seriously beginning to look old. The bathrooms were horrible, lots of maintenance work is need in them. The food was expensive and frankly not very good. The staff were not nearly as Disneylike looking frankly bored and more interested in their own conversations rather than helping us. We only spent one day here and have to say were delighted that we hadn't booked in for a 3 day trip as would have not been able to fill the days.Disney you have spoiled us before with your fantastic parks and think you need to spend a little more time and money on this one.","Neutral"
"We are WDW veterans, but this was our first trip to Disneyland. We knew ahead of time that it was smaller and different than Orlando Disney, so we knew not to try and compare, but just enjoy. Loved the theming of the park.We went on Thanksgiving Day and were pleased with the low crowds. It was also our daughter's 14th birthday and she received a lot of attention from cast members with her Disney birthday button, which was free for the asking.","Positive"
"Our large party (8x adults & 6x children) travelled to Disneyland Paris on 26th December 2015 and spent two days in both of the theme parks.  We purchased our tickets ahead of time in the UK at a cost of   95 per person which is...More","Negative"

"Disneyland Hong Kong pales in terms of size and variety when compared to other Disneyland parks in the rest of the world.Best to go during the weekday especially midweek where the crowd is less. Check the weather ahead before booking a ticket as some rides may be shut during heavy rain. In summer remember to bring hats and sun block.Those who are budget conscious should bring their own container of water   drink as there are water points for you to fill. The price of soft drinks are price like 6 star hotel and hence be warned. In addition bring some snacks too.Plan your day trip well so as to maximum your time at the park as each adventure or ride is some distance from each other. Include in your plan should cater for the afternoon parade and the evening fireworks.On the whole, if it is not crowded as in jam packed, it can be a relaxing day trip for the family.","Neutral"
"Although it's a norm to wait in line, this place is crowed much, lines are long for 60 minutes and above, even the  FAST PASS  machines shut off at noon so basically if you are late, you have no chance for the fast pass to certaIn rides. Besides, all smokers are enjoying their liberty to smoke in parks, despite this is a kids place. Food court are horrible, lack of flow control and very pricey. BRING your own food if you could.","Negative"
"The place is small enough that you can do 2 theme parks, one each in day and able to ride and experience some shows. The 3rd day would be to just relax and go over once again to those attractions that you want to. There are several attractions that were closed though but it's okay. The only one that's new I think was the Star Wars attraction. My kids love the submarine Nemo ride. Of course wear good walking shoes and comfortable clothes. Bring water if you can because the prices are triple. I didn't like that you have to pay for the photo pass feature everyday when you download the Disneyland app since you're barely looking at the pictures taken that day. If you want to buy a particular picture then it'll cost you more. Use the fast pass a lot and it'll help you budget your time. Bring sunscreen even though the weather was 65 75 when we went.","Positive"
"It is indeed overated, expensive at 65 eur, food drink is also expensive. Queues are ridiculously long for what proves to be a minute or two of an average ride. Technology has progressed, kids have high expectations nowadays. I am sorry but a mechanised pirate of the carribean that only moves in one direction cannot be considered as adequate in the 21st century. And as far as the fast rides are concerned there are only 4 of them. One in each adventure land... Disappointed. Maybe only good for the under 13s.","Neutral"
"We just came back from HK Disneyland. The weather was extremely hot and humid up to 33 o'celcius. We went in around 11:30am but it was alread pack with people. I was told this just normal peak but already we need to wait half an hour (under shade but still v hot) for a mere one minute ride.The best part were the festival of the lion king. The show was fantastic with energetic dancing and movement. There was never a dull moment. But waiting for the gate to open was a hell enough. The times guide advised us to go there early as they would closed the gate 10 mins before the show, so we waited and waited under the hot weather for more than 25 minutes to be allows in. It was crowded and small fans at the edge of the shade just couldn't help much. And they still allowed those who are late to come in. We felt wasted time in the waiting.About the food, quite expensive but choice aplenty. We resisted the FP because it just let you go fast on only 3 rides which i think is not worth it.My tips : the tarzan's treehouse not to mention, just boring and we missed the chance to go on the river cruise. Space Mountain thrilling and Blatz Light Year is like playing computer games. We stayed at the Hotel Disneyland and had the breakfast with character in the enchanted garden. I will in my review in another title.","Neutral"
"We have just got back from our holiday in the US. We have been to Disney many times across the global network. This holiday was in California so we were at the Anaheim location. The crowds and resulting queues and waiting time made this visit unbearable for me. It was only that my child would have been disappointed otherwise I would have packed up and left. Not only are the waiting times unreasonable the number of breakdowns (or in the language of the staff there  maintenance work ) was unprecedented, we stood in line in some cases for 80 minutes to be told that the ride was out for maintenance. There was no offer of a FastPass or other acknowledgement of the time waisted in a line to nowhere. Unfortunately I think Disney are living on an historical legacy but if they are not carful, they will start to loose what is a special brand. I will not be back anytime soon.","Negative"
"Be sure to get the correct train ticket. Even though I ordered our tickets at a booth (in both ENG and FR) the ticketer sold us the wrong tickets. When we got to Disneyland Paris, not only did we have to buy the correct train ticket, we had to pay a fine.WARNING: Do not buy your tickets online the same day you are going because they will not accept the ticket. They also will not let you exchange the ticket at the gate to a day ticket.Wasn't aware of the online ticket restriction and had to go back to the ticket line to purchase day tickets (over 2hrs wait). Was never able to get a refund so in addition to wasting a lot of time, we were out a couple hundred of dollars.Park is smaller than Disneyland in CA. In addition, there was no notice that about half of the park was under renovation so there was not much to do! Finished the park within 3 4hrs.I reserved a late lunch at Bistrot Chez R  my and the service was atrocious. Food was mediocre. Cute decor though.The whole experience was the worst on our Euro trip. My BF is anti Disney while I'm a big fan so it didn't help my argument. Wouldn't recommend.","Negative"

"This was my second disneyland experience. This is a lovely place to visit irrespective of the age. If going from paris then its better to book your taxi in advance which will take you there and will wait for you there. You can go by metro too but I preferred the taxi any day. This place have different parks for big and small guests. Which i found not very appealing as you have to buy tickets for them separately. You can't have super rides and disney parade in one ticket. ( which was not so in hongkong ). But still it was a lovely fun filled and happy day for me and my family. Do include it in your list even if you think you are too grownup for that. ","Positive"
"I have visited disneyland paris several times as a child and as a adult alike but my current trip starting the 20th May in the Disneyland park with my partner and 5 year old daughter has been very disappointing, we have found alot of the main attracions to be closed for refurbishment and as my daughter is only 126cm she cannot go on the idiana jones or space mountain rides, she may be 5 but she is a great thrill seeker and with the big thunder mountain being the only big coaster she could ride being closed she was very bored and unimpressed by rides like pinocchio and snow white. Then also to find that peter pan (one of my faves as a child) was also closed as well as most of adventure land, they may as well of shut pirates of the carribean and closed that part of the park altogether. Then to find yesterday as we went into the Disney studios that the  rock and roller coaster  is also closed just topped it off as it was another coaster that my daughter could of fit on yet it was not possible again. To add to it was when we cued up for the new  ratatouille  ride we were told shortly after that there were technical difficulties and we could not go on. I think that disney should either of concentrated there efforts on certain rides at certain times and not all at once or at least offer a discount ticket as you are not getting the whole experience from a ticket that is the same price with all the rides open.","Negative"
"Most of the attractions are the same as the ones in Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, with the exception of Toy Story Land.They have changed some of the great attractions im Tomorrowland which I feel is a big mistake. Autopia (also known as Tomorrowland Speedway) has been shut completely and I remember there was a roller coaster ride which is also gone. However, they've replaced it with Buzz Lightyear Space Mission, which is fun   its a 1v1 laser shooting game where to hit targets to gain points. I remember I was so good at it I scored over a million points (max level) HAHA.Space Mountain ride is a must go!!! It's the same as the one in Disney World!!! Loads of fast corners and humps!!!The rest is pretty much the same so nothing much to talk about.The only thing good is with the opening of Shanghai Disneyland, you will hardly see any Mainland Chinese tourists in Hk Disneyland. So no more long queues and queue cutting.They do have the fast pass system but it's only for like 3 attractions (not the rides) so don't even use it   it's pointless.","Neutral"
"We went to the Disneyland Park in California. Of the 3 parks, we went to the one for kids toddlers.I am giving this a 3 5 review because some of the rides were out of service due to maintenance or other improvements. A day here is not enough. It is better to stay a few days since there are 3 theme parks that you can enjoy and experience.","Neutral"
"Attractions are good for the kids, but within one weekend day you can get maximum 4 main rides. Everywhere there is a key for 90 minutes minimum, so called  fast passes  are also scheduled for 2 hours ahead. The result is walking around in horrendous crowd, queuing everywhere. Two parks pass is therefore overpriced, since you are not able to make it at all. I must say it is a adult nightmare.","Negative"
"It's my fourth visit and I was more of a tourist guide ..we had less than four hours there and we could only cover two shows   the lion king and the 3d musical show. .The rest was just a breeze through. .Nothing much has changed though except that the night parade was colourfully litted compared to those earlier times I went.","Positive"

We got there by 10:00 am and most restaurants and all the stores were closed. Waiting time would say 15 minutes and then we would be stuck in a 1.5 hour line! The food was not very good either. I don  t think we will be coming back. I think we will stick to our beloved Orlando.","Neutral"

"Went to Disneyland, because I had never been. Discovered numerous rides and attractions were closed, because  it's winter.   Winter  didn't seem to stop the crowds. Didn't even have fireworks at the end of the night  because it's winter.  Very disappointed. And the people with strollers will run you over, not to mention the scooter chairs.","Negative"
"What can I say, as long as you expect to stand in a line waiting for the experience to statt, you'll be fine ; ). Avoid holidays and weekends at all costs!!!Clean park, friendly staff, a lot of overpriced fast food but most of the adventures experiences are excellent. We loved Crush's Coaster, Big Thunder Mountain and Tower of Terror","Positive"
"This was a fantastic experience, two of my daughters joined my wife and I which made it even more enjoyable! One of the greatest surprises here, was that many of the original attractions and rides that no longer exist at Disney World are still here! Plus you have the added bonus of the California Park, which is very similar to the studios in Disney World but with some different rides and attractions to offer. It was a great very worth while and fun experience for our family, I would do it again in a heart beat.","Positive"
"we went to Euro Disney from 1 10   5 10 and I have to say it was a rip off from the moment we got off the plane to the moment we got back on!! All they care about is money they cram too many people into every space possible and charge max price for it all! We did the parks in about 2 1 2 days and there was nothing really there for my 7 year old who likes faster rides, Thunder mountain was about it and he was not tall enough for the Space ride.All in all very disappointing and I would next time rather spend more and go Florida as its far better and overall much better value.","Negative"
"We are Disney World Florida obsessives but wanted to give some perspective on our trip to Disneyland France this week.We completed this week our trip to Disneyland Paris   which we tacked on to our wonderful Adventures by Disney Knights & Lights (London & Paris) tour. We had both our kids (under 12) with us, and stayed at the Disneyland Hotel in the VIP section. The VIP package included unlimited fastpass for the FP attractions   which might have been cool if the FP attractions had generally been open (they are not   will explain in a bit). As an aside, the Disneyland hotel was lovely   and we were treated very well. Breakfast is included, and despite some renovations to the exterior and the closing of the California Grille   I thought the hotel exuded a nice charm more intimate than the Grand Floridian Florida. Its pricey   but its right next to the two parks (10 second walk) and I thought worth it if you are only going to be here once or rarely.As for the parks, well   the most important thing to stress is that the parks have significant potential, with some real highlights, and are the subject of massive investment & construction right now. That said, they are clearly woefully, and sometimes comically, mismanaged with excessive closures of kiosks and food locations, often apparently  don't give a crap  staff (there are exceptions to this), and significant deterioration of physical plant and rides. I wont take issue with the high food prices   gate prices are actually low here during the week and its an amusement park.The highlights positives: (1) In two words, DISNEY DREAMS. The castle laser and fireworks show, which is presented at park close (11:00 during my several days), is wondrous. Its sort of a combination of the Magic Kingdom Florida castle laser show and then the following fireworks   but better. It doesn't feature the beautiful song Wishes   but its an extravaganza not to be missed. and unique to the Paris park. A (2) Parade   its brief, and not dissimilar from the parades at the US parks, but we enjoyed it.(3) Pirates of Carribean   wow, a much longer version of the Florida ride and solid entertainment.(4) The castle   beautiful and unique.(5) Cleanliness   I have seen the complaints about the parks being filthy but they appeared clean to me.The lowlights:(1) Construction   to be honest, the parks are not worth visiting until Spring 2017. The main park's main rides are almost all closed. Closures included Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain RR, Star Tours, Peter Pan. RC Racers was closed at WDS. The parks are a giant construction zone right now   Frontier Town is essentially closed. And you can imagine what this does to crowding at open rides   nightmares!!(2) Staff   some were quite pleasant and greeting, but most are apathetic if not disgruntled. Def a MAJOR issue.(3) Wear and Tear   some of it is shocking. I noticed paint peeling off several rides for example. Check out the magic carpet rides   most cars missing tons of paint. You'd never see this in FL.(4) Food lines   out of control, with numerous eateries and kiosks randomly closed. Staffing shortages are really evident   including for food kiosks that require extensive labor such as making crepes. Still only worked by one person. Lots of crowd complaints on this. Some food lines exceeded an hour.(5) Rides breaking down   trust me. Went on Buzz Lightyear three times. Each time ride stopped several times. Same with the Haunted Mansion. At some point we just laughed. All and all, nice hotel, parks will be improved next year hopefully. Wait to then!!","Negative"
"My partner a I have been to Disney many times in Florida and this was out first trip to this park in Anaheim. As usual Disney didn't disappoint and we had an awesome few days visiting the park. Not a great deal else to say other than amazing and well worth going.","Positive"
"We have visited Walt Disney World in Florida on many occasions and always have a great time but decided to check out Disneyland Paris. What a very different experience. The attractions were very good but the park looked rather tired and run down in comparison. Despite many areas being off limits due to alterations there was still need for decoration and updating. This was far from immaculate as we come to expect from Disney with very few cleaning staff in evidence despite groups of them leaning on brushes and chatting in some areas.During our 5 day visit I never saw a toilet attendant and some of the toilets were very smelly and dirty.The main problems I encountered were two fold. The first is that there are smokers everywhere. If you sit on a bench there is likely to be someone next to you blowing smoke. Even in the queues for rides we saw people with cigarettes and one man with a cigar. Secondly, the staff in general let the place down. I hardly saw anyone smile and there was no sense of fun . We had several encounters with over bearing attendants who seemed to be enjoying their power. As an example   we were given a voucher at the hotel for breakfast in the park on one day. The day and time were allocated and our slot was 9am. We had been trying for days without success to try the new Ratatouille ride at the Studios due to fast passes not being available or two hour queues. So, at 10am when the Studios opened a member of our family decided to go to try and obtain a fast pass. He was unsuccessful and returned to the restaurant. However, the attendant at the park entrance would not allow him back in as he had already entered both parks. He was made to stand in a certain spot and wait 5mins until he was told he could enter. This was embarrassing and humiliating and no way to treat a guest.Our other disappointment concerned the 2hours extra time in the park for hotel guests. This was a factor in our choosing a Disney hotel, but in reality, only three rides seemed to be open before 10am.In future we shall return to Orlando where we are welcomed as we should be.","Neutral"
"Please please please take the MTR, there is a special Disney train with windows in the shape of a Mickey Mouse which is super cute. Since I have not been to the one in the US or Paris this was a great experience for me. Go for the big rides first and you can always greet the characters later in the day. The lines for the rides tend to get longer by the afternoon so try to cross them off your list early in the day. The fireworks are a must see.","Positive"
"As a group of 9 ranging in age from 1 50, I think we were a little disappointed overall.Don't get me wrong, I am so glad we went, especially on our first night whence arrived in time for the parade. It was truly everything you wanted it to be, as a child I dreamed of this excitement, and as an adult I was immersed in it. The next morning when we arrived, we we greeted by staff around the street waving at us and saying hello, but it didn't take long for us to noticed the lack of signage for facilities etc, One show we really wanted to see was being set up only 15 minutes prior to its start time, and the electronic equipment didn't work, so it was cancelled. Surely you would give yourself more than15 mins to check your gear? It was a little tired looking overall, and I think parts of it smelled like urine. You could expect musty water smell, but pee?We had set out to start the morning here and then head over to California Park around lunchtime, which we did. We only came back after the other park closed (to shop).I was very happy to see fruit stalls, and other varieties of food. Although, we purchased coffee from the bakery (where I got a great gluten free muffin!) and let's just say the muffin cost $20, because there was no way we were going to drink that coffee, it was nasty!Of course I am happy a to say that I went to Disneyland, but my wondrous memory is only the night parade.","Neutral"
"Two adults   1 boy 9. Excellent roller coasters and 4D Star Wars movie . Hopeless trainride, waiting 1 hour to see.. woods and tunnel in 10 min. Trapped in 2 hours  queu for Thunder Mountain ride. Restrooms very good and food very poor. The fasttrack system with one reservation at a time meant we only had one reservation at 6.30pm. I would not go again , my son rated it 6 out of 10 where the queues were dragging it down and the variety of experiences pulled it up for him.","Neutral"
"I took my son to Disneyland Paris two days ago. I wanted to have a special mother son day, and in his eyes, we probably did. BUT for such a highly reputed theme park, I have a hard time believing the good reviews. I've been living in France for 9 years and I fully understand that it is VERY hard to train French people about the hospitality industry, what the difference is between good service and bad. But the workers for the most part were unhappy in their own lives (maybe can't blame them if they're working at Disney), and not afraid to show it. I would like to think Disney has the means to train employees on being friendly, or even how to fake being friendly.That said   there is a system called  Fast Pass,  which did eliminate some of the queing time. But it was quite inefficient and had some restrictions. Inefficient because they would tell you to come back between 2   5 hours!! And you couldn't use it for more than 1 or 2 rides at a time. Now the biggest disappoinment to me was the FOOD. Never in my life, even from my simple grocer cheap discount food, have I had such terrible, awful food. The exception was the popcorn and candy apples. Every restaurant offered the same  American  fare, that was so flavorless that stating it  left a lot to be desired  would be a severe understatement. I am not a 5 star luxury diner and not someone who has the highest expectations either. I am a regular lower middle class person. But I would not be surprised AT ALL if the food they serve you comes from the same factory that prepares DOG FOOD. And maybe it's even below that. I mean really, Disney, how do you get away with that? OMG, my son loves  Ribs  and when we went to the  Western  style restaurant and he ordered ribs I thought he was being picky until I cut into them and tasted them. First of all, 90% of the  ribs  were blubber layered over a bone. What little meat there was, tasted like boiled mush   literally. They are serving premade microwave meals and I can tell you, with all honesty, that they are as low of quality as you can find. But you will pay a premium price for it. I am ready to write to Disney myself about this matter, because I would think a corporation with such a reputation would want to please their guests. However, this was just beyond disappointing. It was just flat out disgusting. Keep in mind, I am NOT a picky person!!! We also had a hotdog that tasted as if it were boiled beyond oblivion. I mean really, how hard is it to make a simple hotdog. I can do that myself with the cheapest hot dogs from the grocery store and it will taste better. I realize some people are just of a complaining nature and nothing is ever good enough. But this is why you should listen to my review, because I am not one of these. This is why I am writing this, because I really think you should read my warning, and I hope the people at Disney have a look at these reviews every once in a while too.In addition, I'm sorry, but there were a number of E. European guests who lack what W. Europeans would call manners. And then you have the French teenie boppers who are in heat in line behind you about to have sex while waiting. No discretion for public displays of affection.The Buzz Lightyear ride did have technical probs. And so did Indiana Jones, after we waited for 45 min. in line (posted waiting time was 30 min), then they told us it would be at least another 30 min and we left. It is just very, very tiresome to walk around with these huge crowds and stand in line for so many hours. I would suggest that Disney 1. outsources food services if they're incapable of delivering anything decent. 2. Set a maximum capacity for the park so that it isn't overcrowded and the guests can enjoy it.One last bad point   You know Paris has the same weather as London, right? Well you probably don't. I didn't. Now that I've been living here for 9 years, I can assure you that they might have 10% less rain, but that's it. It rains here nonstop. And it's very cold most of the year. You might have a 1 month window of good weather. But I'm sure the crowds during this period are intolerable. So I would just suggest avoiding this park at all costs. You would probably have a better time at one of the real Disney parks in the US if you can manage to save up enough to get over there.Hope this helped","Negative"
"Early entry to the park was great as it gave our family of four time to enjoy some of the more popular rides without the long lines. The Jungle Cruise was a family favourite but the kids, 2 & 4 actually enjoyed the Pirates ride as well as the Haunted Mansion in the afternoon. Toon Town was fun for the kids and Goofy's play area was a nice break for the kids to run around in. My 2 year old loved Its a Small World but my DH and 4 year old tolerated it for family. We didn't do the line up for Princess Fantasy Faire but the wait just couldn't be justified as we participated in the Mother's Day Brunch at the Disneyland Hotel and saw all the princesses without the line up. Ariel's Grotto for breakfast is also a good way to meet them if you don't want a line up. Don't miss Peter Pan's ride, Dumbo and Astro Blasters if you have little kids. The park got really crowded in the evening but I found out later that it was due to reduced entry prices so if you don't like the crowds, keep it early. The parade was lots of fun but if you can afford it, splurge for tickets to Fantasmic. Even my frugal DH said it was worth it. Definitely come back again soon!","Positive"
"If you have not been here, you are in for a real treat. This park is great for everyone of all ages, as it will bring out the kid in you however old you are. It's all done so well, kept so clean, and friendly helpful staff. Be prepared to wait for certain rides in the summer months as it does get very busy, and don't try to do it all in a day. Better spread over 3 to 4 days if you have kids in tow. Best value to buy tickets in advance, or if you go more than 5 days in a year, it's better to buy an annual pass available on site. Fabulous place, can't wait to return..","Positive"
"the rides were fun as usual and the park was tidy with immaculate gardens but the visit did not shine as much as previously.There was very limited assistance for disabled guests.Some rides had an electronic queue option but not enough of them,There were also no reserved spaces for parade viewing unlike other disney parks. Still enjoyed the 2 days there but slightly disappointed as usually Disney have the edge on customer service","Neutral"
"We were so disappointed by our visit. We love visiting the Disney parks in Orlando  this one is no comparison. This location is a cramped park with tons of rude people and long lines. Not fun....","Negative"
"Wife and I have been to Disney world in Orlando and even to Disneyland many times. However, we were totally disappointed with the number of closed attractions and general poor maintenance issues we observed everywhere. Disney folks were unhelpful.(or nonexistent). We attended the Wild West in the evening. A great show (at an extra cost). This show helped to salvage our day. All in all, if you have been to Disneyworld or Disneyland you will find this an expensive disappointment. Save you money and spend more time in Paris!","Negative"
"Its a good place to go for your first visit to a disneyland park. Few of the rides and adventures are not disney high level standards. Avoid going in summers as its very hot. Water  cold drinks are priced 3 times in the disneyland. Long Q awaits you. Anything between 45 75 mins are each of the major attraction. People coming from mainland china to visit disneyland are quite rude, loud and have no sense of standing in queue. No characters walking around the park to meet children. you really have to go to one place to meet them and click pictures. For that also you need to stand in a Q. This place is nothing compared to US disney.But if you or your kids havent visited disneyland . Then go.","Neutral"
"Came to Disney for spring break.I thought we were coming to a not so busy weekend,guess I was wrong.There was alot of field trips,omg,it was going to be a long day to try getting on rides...We went on the 26,guess next time I'll come on a weekday but we had fun.","Positive"
"So looking forward to this, but what a let down. We were going to buy a 2 day pass and so glad we didn't. There is very little to do. Each (land) has only one maybe two rides, most of the show times clash and the food, drink and souvenir prices are way over the top. I always expect to pay a bit more in a theme park but this was just blatant gouging. I can think of better ways to blow $500 hkd and waste a day.","Negative"
"stopped at the cheyne hotel , breakfast is a nightmare packed to the hill no table once you get your food,very little choice tea time is different if you go around 6pm its quiet choice is good and is a pleasant experience, the parks were too busy ques to any ride 1 hour plus often 11 2 hours coke is   3.00 a bottle ice creams   3.00 each 8 chicken nuggets   6.00 went by euro star no problems stright into euro disney","Neutral"
"I went to Hong Kong Disneyland in July 07 and overall had a great time. If you have been to either of the Disney parks in Anaheim or Orlando you   ll probably find HK Disneyland to be a bit of let down. Most of the major rides (Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean, Splash Mountain etc) aren   t there and the park is operating a very small number of attractions. Space Mountain, Jungle Cruise, and several of the FnatasyLand rides are open but beyond that the park is noticeablyempty. There is no doubt that the park will be better in 4 or 5 yearswhen many of the rides you expect from a Disneyland are opened. I wasable to see pretty much everything (including watching a parade) in around 4 hours. Having said this, the park is well designed and the look feel of the park is excellent (much better than the truly awful Euro Disneyland).Those rides that are open look great  particularly the Jungle Cruise which was far and away the best of the Jungle Cruise rides I   ve been on. The shows were good and the parade I saw was excellent. It   s a little weird hearing Mickey talking in Chinese but it adds to the overall uniqueness of the experience. I found the service throughout the park to be excellent. All the cast members provided excellent service and you certainly are gettingthe type of Disney style service you would expect. A word of note however  I   ve read in several places that crowd behaviour was poor interms of queue etiquette etc and this was certainly my experience. There was a lot of people pushing ahead in queue   s queue jumping and the overall theme park behaviour rules you experience in the US appeared to be optional in HK Disneyland.Food was to the usual Disneyland standard (eg average and expensive).It was good to see a lot more tailouring of the menu options to suit the Asian market (instead of the usual hamburger hot dogs). Getting to the park is very easy. I used the subway to get the train to Sunny Bay and then you transfer onto a special Disney train that takes you direct to the park. The train from Hong Kong to the park was very quick and takes about 20 minutes. Overall I   d recommend HK Disneyland only if you haven   t been to any of the other Disneylands or if you are a huge Disney fan.","Positive"
"My wife, I and 8 year daughter visited on a Wednesday in June from 8 AM   10 PM. It was Grad Night, so there were a lot of high school kids in the park. I'm sure there were more across the way at California Adventure since there are more thrill rides there. I strategically picked this day because it was a black out date for annual pass holders and the magic morning (one hour early arrival for Disneyland resort guests) was at California Adventure that day. Still, the crowds were ridiculous. Everyone sidewalk was packed, every line for each ride was long, and even the lines to eat very mediocre and over priced food were long. If you want a good view of one of the free parades or shows, you have to arrive an hour early and sit. We had fast passes to Fantasmic (wonderful show by the way), but the view was not that great and arriving earlier and getting one of the expensive dinner packages would have provided better views. After the 9 PM Fantasmic show, we tried to see the 9:30 PM fireworks, but they basically roped off the better viewing areas on Main Street (because it is packed and they let tons of people into the park in the evening just to view the fireworks), so there was nowhere for us to stand to watch the fireworks because they kept saying  you can't stand there  and we basically got ushered out of the park because there was nowhere else to go. On top of the that, there was a glitch in the fireworks show, and it stopped shortly after it began and never finished. And then the number of rides that were not available was annoying as well. In the morning, Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, and the Haunted Mansion were all not available. Peter Pan's flight and Innoventions were both out the entire day and the Storybook Land Canal boats were out most of the afternoon. We were able to get Fastpass to ride Space Mountain and the Haunted Mansion. We obtained the Space Mountain Fastpass at noon and had to return at 4:25 pm to go on the ride. Splash Mountain only opened up later in the afternoon and by the time I came by, the wait was 120 minutes and there were out of Fastpasses. We did enjoy a handful of the rides, most notably the Jungle Cruise, Pirates of the Caribbean, It's a Small World, and the Disneyland Railroad. The park is very clean for the number of people that go through it and we still had some memorable moments. That being said, for $100 ticket, I don't feel I got my money's worth. I do recommend you arrive at the time they open because you can at least go on a few rides without long waits. The Matterhorn is probably a good ride to start with since they do not offer Fastpasses and the lines were very long. Here is a great site for planning: http:  www.disneytouristblog.com","Negative"
"While park and ride was ok .. Met a v rude staff managing the parade .. totally shocked.. won't recommend this park","Negative"
"A few weeks before visiting Disneyland I broke my knee and was therefore on crutches for my visit. I researched that I would be able to fast track certain rides with my friends to avoid standing for long periods of time and that I should bring evidence to get this. I brought my hospital letters and after queuing for over an hour to be seen at a desk I provided them with this to be told I would have to book at rides and wait hours and go back at the booking time to get on. This system was ridiculous as it meant I had to kill sometimes 2 hours before going on anything and before long the day is over. I found the staff very rude and unfriendly, in the main restaurant by the castle I was made to queue without a seat for again another hour and the lady showed no sympathy towards myself while we waited. Then to watch the illuminations show there was no seating either so it ended up being a really long and unenjoyable day at Disney, the worst part of all was that at the end I was told they should have given me a wheelchair which would have made life much easier but obviously they failed to do this. The whole thing distracted from the beauty of the park and the show at the end which is truly amazing.","Negative"
"We went with our 3 year old son, and he had a blast.The adults were however somewhat disappointed with the small size, the relatively low number of attractions in the space provided, and the insane overprice of all food items inside the park. The food was reasonable in quality, although nothing special.The worst however was that the toilets were overly dirty. Having so many mainland Chinese visitors, park management should know that mainland Chinese men do not bother to lift the toilet seat before leaking, and that they have some sort of spreading device attached, distributing the urine evenly everywhere (outside the toilet). The toilets there are simply disgusting, without exception. Some additional cleaning staff would do wonders for sure. been there done that, I see no reason to go back unless my son nags me too much about it.","Neutral"
"I've been coming to disney land every 2 years since i was 7 years old and each time I've noticed the security isn't very determined to keep the park safe. You pass the part were they check your bags then you have the choice to go straight or through security and each time they stopped us and make all of us go through even the kids and at first i use to think okay i get that they want to make sure no one gets through hiding any weapons i really like that they have security reach until i noticed they mostly only stop dark skinned people letting the light skinned just walk on by and i thought maybe it's because they didn't see them until i seen the security look directly at them then look at us and come walking toward us. If you've noticed this happened one too many times please comment and write more reviews we are very hurt and don't think anyone else should feel this way. None of us should be treated any different because of our race. We are equal and we shouldn't be treated any different from others.","Negative"
"I took the family to Disneyland for some fun, and it was fun the first day, however not so much the second day( FYI don't complain to any of the workers there) I seen it happen twice in a matter of an hour on both ends of the park a lady walked up and complained talking normal not rising her voice or being aggressive and asked to speak with someone about a complaint and they called security on her within seconds the old folk security crew was surrounding her so she said forget it and left. Then at the gate where they check bags a lady put her purse on the table for them to check but left the strap around her neck and they yelled at her, yes I said yelled at her then called security when she asked to speak to the manager. I am glad that I paid there over priced tickets so I could see that.","Negative"
"We have made numerous trips to Disneyland, California and have always had a magical time. Unfortunately our recent visit to Disneyland Paris lacked the same magic that we had experienced previously (albeit in California). The park has a very similar layout to that in California and many similar rides, but ultimately it was the staff that lack the excitement of being a part of the Disney magic. In the 12 hours that we spent in Disneyland we saw only one character (other than in the parades) and very few smiles on the faces of the staff. Very disappointing.","Negative"
"We went in the height of summer and found the park really crowded. The wait time for rides was a bit of a hindrance to getting to see everything. Allow yourself two days.  And unlike California Adventure Park, they have no alcohol on property.","Neutral"

"2 of the main rides were closed which was really disappointing and some of the childrens rides only lasted about 2 3 minutes but you're waiting 40 minutes to get on them.Everything is overpriced there, but that is no surprise and many other theme parks are the same, but the quality of the products has really fallen compared to a few years ago.The Stunt show, parade, live character shows and the firework display in my opinion are the decent things worth waiting for at the park.Overall the experience was ok, my child enjoyed it which is the main thing but wouldn't do it for the 3rd time.","Neutral"

"This park is very small when compared to Orlando. This is our second visit and each time we have found that if it rains all the rides shut down and as their is almost nothing else to do, you end up walking around the park in the rain. We arrived, did the Carosel ride, then went to do Buzz Lightyear (60 minute wait) to be told the ride was closed due to weather. We walked around trying to find something to do and eventually gave up and went for lunch. We had very long lunch (very good food) and then went out to find the rides were still closed. We went to Lion King show (people were panicking in the lines there were so many people waiting), we came out and still the rides were closed. We checked and saw that the afternoon parade was still going to happen so stayed for that; what a waste of time, about three floats and over in minutes. Still the rides were closed. The rain wasn't heavy and their wasn't thunder over the park. By late afternoon we gave up and went home. We had bought expensive tickets to ride for 3 minutes on the Carosel!!!! if there is any danger of rain don't go to the park. Ocean Park is a much better place to visit on any day.","Negative"
"I haven't visited a Disney park in over ten years and I was very excited to take my wife and one year old for their first taste of that Disney magic. We flew with air france from Manchester and had a great experience with this airline all though the landing was a bit rough, the transport to the park via the VEA shuttle was ok, the driver seemed to leave only one side of the luggage area open so myself and lady from Hattersley went around and opened it our selfs, the bus was it and had no AC working . The hotel was wonderful (we stayed at the Cheyenne, I have wrote a separate review for this).The park was cold and windy and a lot the rides were closed for various reasons, this I was ok with. The cast were always wonderful and always very helpful, except a very rude cast member in Casey's Corner who thought I was out of order for complaining that my food order was wrong. The whole experience brought back such fond memory's of childhood visits to Orlando and I was glad I could share this with my young family. The only thing Disney needs to get a handle on is A) smoking and B) rude patrons. A I'm not sure what the smoking laws in France are but in Disney in the states you are only aloud to smoke in designated areas to reduce the risk of passive smoking, as a ex smoker this is something I was acutely aware of and the owners need to get a handle of, many people from different country's visit these parks and all have different rules about smoking and these should be considered. B a lot of the patrons at the park ( I'd like to say mostly French but in truth lots of people from different cultures) were very rude and inconsiderate, I've had people from Spain trying to queue jump, people from France insulting me and my family for asking politely in French if we could get by, queue jumping, not allowing us to be part f the magical experience but just generally being rude and that nearly ruined for me. I speak French and have no issue with the French people and have always tried to immerse myself in other cultures when visiting their country's, I always here about people talking about the rudeness of Brits abroad and this certainly wasn't the case, these individuals have ruined the experience and have now in my eyes painted their fellow country men in a poor light. I will be returning to Disney but I doubt I will be returning to DLP for a long time. I will however return to France as I love the country and the culture.","Neutral"
"My biggest concern were the number of rides that went down in the two days we were there.Some for less than an hour and others for over an hour. Knott's Berry Farm didn't have these problems during the two days we were there.","Neutral"
"After visiting Disneyland California for the last 30 years, nearly a trip a year I feel I have a good handle on what a Disney experience should be. Upon entering the park I noticed that many of the drink  snack wagons were closed. The restaurants were all closed until around 12noon. I was unable to find someone to help me with a reservation to one of the restaurants. The staff at the park seems disinterested with the guests, many of them holding their hats of their uniforms instead of wearing them. The uniforms were tired and in disrepair. The park on the whole was dirty with debris in the corners. The water in the ponds, lakes and creeks seemed to be about 50% full with the water being dirty. the two rides that are fairly important to the park: Indiana Jones was closed and the Big Rock Railroad broke while guests were riding it and they had to be evacuated from the ride. It was now closed. Walt would not have been happy. I think the park has the potential to be great; but the staff needs to be overhauled, major changes in how the park opens with everything closed, and how the park is cleaned needs to be addressed. California is a 10 or and 11 and the French version is struggling to get to a 6.","Neutral"
"We went on a sweltering day at the end of August when the kids were back in school so expected shorter lines which they were. Shorter than Universal, but many of the main attractions were closed or under repair which we weren't made aware of when purchasing tickets. Closed: Haunted House, Space Mountain, waited in line at Indiana Jones and had to get out after waiting awhile because it broke down, fortunately we were able to go on it later. The Matterhorn was impossible to get in the car, I am 6'1 250 . I suggested a refurbishment, the miserable ride attendant said they just were done over. In general most of the park employees seemed miserable with the exception of our waiter at the Blue Bayou which I highly recommend as a respite from the insanity of the day and the heat. The Max Pass system is a little daunting and archaic compared to the Fast Pass at Universal, but we got the hang of it pretty quick and it was only $10 more per ticket compared to $100 more for Universal. The park in general is classic but starting to get a little dated. Thankfully we were able to cool off on the Splash Mountain log flume Ride.","Neutral"
"Don't bother for the next 12   months. They've closed down heaps of rides and 4 broke down while we were there causing huge delays to wait times. No river boat cruise, no motorway ride, no alpine, the list goes on. Apparently they are closed for the new Star Wars addition, it will want to be worth it because Disneyland is heading from where dreams are made, to nightmares for parents with disappointed kids. We went when school was in for USA. A two day single pass was cheaper than a two day pass if you go Mon   Thu. First day was a Monday, Star Wars ride first up excellent fun, use the fast pass system and while you're waiting for your allocated time line up in the standby regular lines for other rides, least that's what worked for us. The first day worked like clockwork aside from awful long wait times some of the rides were great. Avoid haunted mansion it's a waste not scary unless you consider a 40 min wait for  was that it  from a hungry teenager with sore feet to be scary enough. Prepare to be faced with ridiculously long waiting times anything from 20 to 70 mins and trust me try and talk a kid out of waiting that long when they've done their research good luck! So we waited and waited noting the only rides worth waiting for, splash mountain, Indiana jones (if it works) and Star Wars but get fast passes for them. Second day was literally the worst experience of my life at any amusement park ever. We went on a Thursday were faced with multiple breakdowns got stuck on the temple of doom ride for ages before it restarted with all lights on but no sound, so effectively just sitting in a cart on tracks bumping along with a bunch of strangers lol, we were offered a second ride straight away which we took up and was cut short again. So crappy. Then we lined up and waited for 70 mins for splash mountain which subsequently broke down just as we neared the gate to get on lol absolutely ridiculous day full of 70  wait times 4 separate ride closures and breakdowns throuout the park. Either the construction at Star Wars set off a chain reaction of breakdowns or they need to review maintenance systems urgently. Aweful day won't be in a hurry to return.","Neutral"
"We visited with our family in July...peak season. We were dissappointed to find so many of the rides and attractions closed with a sign saying  we are renovating for your future enjoyment . Coming from Australia this is a one off. We marked on our map that about half of the rides were closed, including ALL of the children's playground areas. Why are we paying full price for half a park? I would understand if we had visited in the off season, but for mid summer this is not good enough. If you are on a family holiday to Europe from overseas don't waste your money. Spend it on Legoland in London instead!","Negative"

For it to take all of our savings and extra financing just to go there..... and to drive 23 hours      ...it was horrible my kids were very sad...     .it was so busy we could not ride any rides...people were running in to us knocking my daughter over.....we could not see any of the shows or parades people were crowded everywhere... workers were very rude about standing were you could try to see...i guess it was a reserved spot, ....go figure........ just a heads up dont go durring a holiday they ruined our Christmas. .... I will never go again durring a holiday!!!!!! I also notified the   customer relations desk   of the   problems we were having they said next time dont plan durring a holiday .....well I kind of figured that much...they were no help at all....I rate this theme park very low... wish my family could have had fun for christmas...like all the commercials...it is supposed to be the happiest place on earth.. well not for us my kids they were very sad.....lines were like 3 to 4 hours long....we even paid extra for the park hopper tickets both parks were the same.....I guess that a theme park that large wont care about losing business for a family of 4 when they have so much business already.....

"First the positives   parade, light show and 2 lots of fireworks to welcome in 2014. All were executed with typical Disney aplomb.The negatives   this event was unsafe, uncomfortable and the D organisation cared little for the basic comforts of the  guests  who paid around $100 a pop to experience the night. I had to argue with one of the  cast  to access a restroom so my daughter could wait in a line for 25 minutes to use the facilities.This was because they were trying to enforce a one way system on the crowd in an apparent effort to avoid crushing.Not my idea of enjoyment   only an illustration of corporate greed.","Negative"
"We had a good time as we were with young grandchildren who had nothing to compare the experience with and whose faces light up with bright, moving colours. We did not expect it to be up to the US standard but were particularly disappointed that it had no real    Disney    feel, there was a lack of Characters and many rides were closed. Sadly you cannot escape the vast number of people smoking even in Fantasyland. When I looked after the baby, while the other members of the family went on a rides, there was a continuous stream of smokers intermingling with the pushchairs.They do not enforce the smoking areas and children are constantly subjected to tobacco smoke and cigarette butts. This is unacceptable.We were a family including small children and stayed at the nearby Relais. Their free on demand shuttle was fantastic (they provide child seats and load pushchairs etc in the back) we went backwards and forwards several times a day. It also gave us sensibly priced food options: numerous family friendly restaurants 3 mins walk and a covered shopping mall only 4 mins walk with a hypermarket if you want to stock up to use the small kitchen in your hotel room.","Negative"
"I stood in line at City Hall for 20 minutes while my severely autistic nonverbal daughter had 2 loud meltdowns just to get to the counter and have a blonde shoulder length haired middle age lady (7 22 17 at roughly 10 am) basically tell me there is no disability program anymore. She said it is now fair for everyone (really? Uuurrrgh! ) as if people who really needed the disability pass like us were screwing their system. Their old system was a life saver. Ok. She was rude. My family spent 10 days at Disney World over Christmas previously and there everything was  magical  and upbeat and friendly. This woman did not give one crap and it was obvious. My daughters disabilities are obvious really obvious unfortunately and this woman just was cold. So we did the best we could. Most of the workers at the rides did  get  it by just seeing what we were dealing with and made our line waits bearable with special passes or giving us return times on the spot. At one point when a worker at Snow White made us go to a kiosk to get a return time and it was clearly tough dragging my child to the kiosk an associate at the kiosk started to help us and she realized the woman at City Hall never put our tickets into some type of disability cue so she did and explained the system and was nice in a  magical Disney  way. She tracked us down a few minutes later and really helped us and tried making up for our bad experience. She was great and deserves some major recognition. Her name is Robin from Canada with short red hair. She saved the day. Best advice   buy the Max Pass. It's better than the really bad disability system they currently have going on because at least you can schedule your next ride on your phone. The app that you use the Max Pass with has some major glitches though because I could only get it to work half of the time and the one time it only took 3 of the 4 fast passes off of the ride we had just gone on and I had to track down someone to take the last ticket off so we could get new fast passes for all 4 of us. Other rip off   the Blue Bayou dinner package for the parade do not get it!!!!! My kids are 11 and 12 and hardly eat. Due to their age they had to order off the adult menu at a fixed price   $300 for 4 people. The seats are a curb section   no actual seat but on the ground. They also need more shuttles to the parking garages at the end of the day. Other than that it's Disney. The kids loved it. Really loved it. $1000 for one day is steep but my basically nonverbal daughter did manage to say Happy Birthday about a million times because it was her birthday and she was loving her day at Disneyland. Thanks Robin!","Positive"
"Food is not worth for your money. We didn't enjoy much of the rides due to long queue and some people DO NOT know how to fall in line, while some staff tolerate the behavior.

What a huge Disappointment for the large amount of money you spent! Visited both parks and were extremely overcrowded! I   m so happy to see you are making it NO SMOKING, Maybe you could make it an Adults only Morning Admission sometime?? I have 6 kids and we went for a little getaway and gift to each and it was not even what we thought! My experience at the other park was the worst! I was knocked over by a little boy! Just horrible, it was a horrible visit! This truly is not the    Happiest place on Earth   !!!!","Negative"
"I'll start by saying if you are a Disney fan, this is a must do! The park is very different than Disney World, however very similar. It's like a smaller version with some  original  nuances to make it unique and charming. The non snack food dining is better than WDW though. Enjoy the happiest place on earth!","Positive"

"We were told of VIP treatment for my boy who was celebrating his 8th Birthday in Disney. I tried getting more information via email requesting for assistant but took me more than 5 emails and 4 different persons before i can place an order for a birthday cake and make a reservation for lunch there.We ordered a Disney Birthday cake(taste good) and made a reservation at the Main Street Corner Cafe for a group of 13 people. To our disappointment, NO VIP Treatment at ANY OF THE RIDES; no VIP TREATMENT at restaurant; He did receive a 'birthday goodie bag' from the cake i ordered. BUT, would you consider a party hat, 1 sheet of disney serviette, 1 disposable plastic spoon and fork, 1 colouring paper, 1 balloon a Goodie Bag?

My review says it all....","Negative"
"The lines are low, thats good, the staff are rude, I guess thats europe, all in all, this is a theme park without the spirit, It lacks the magic of Disney in the USA and I have seen them all. If you want to just do the rides, this is great, but if your looking for that old fashion magic, go to the USA. The characters come out without minders watching and its kaos to get a picture, kids will leave dissapointed. Staff are light on the ground, so you have to rely on the maps. All in all it was very expensive and lacks the spirit. Its like Disney didnt run it, or they left  Walt  manual at home in the USA. I am not pro US by any means, but I think its important to understand the limitations especially if your making the trip just for the park. Accomodation is great at the holiday inn , But it will cost you.","Negative"

"Just returning from dlp and hugely disappointed in the amount of closed and broken attractions. Check the website to see the list but pretty much most of frontier land and adventure land is boarded up for attractions under long term refurbishment and repair I simply don't understand how they can schedule so much closure at the same time in the middle of summer ( I know there is no down time for the park but it felt as if half the park were closed ). Also while we were there this week. Phantom mansion Peter Pan and pirates of the Caribbean were all closed at various times because of failures. There was a big crane over the castle today while people repaired  cleaned inspected it   in the middle of the day !!) I don't know if they reduced the number of visitors to compensate but it didn't feel like it   felt like same number of people queuing for less things   longer queues The rides that were working continue to be terrific and the parades are delightful and the whole crazy sweaty hysterical money grabbing machine continues to be unmistakably Disney and we all know we are going to go there whatever the reviews   but I am surprised at how poor the attitude or ideal of paris is compared to the spiritual home at Florida I wish I saved my money and showed my young son Disney at its best in the U.S. .","Neutral"

"We were here for 2 days with our son (almost 2 years old) at the very beginning of September. if possible try to avoid the weekends as they are very crowded. We were there for a Sunday and a Monday, Monday was definitely a bit quieter. The shows were great and you should make time to see them   our son adored the Lion King show and the Golden Mickeys. The staff were very good at all attractions and we never ad queue jumpers at all during our 2 days. The food was alright and consistent with what we expected, you aren't going there for fine dining! overall a great trip and I'd highly recommend for people with smaller children as there probably isn' too much for older kids or adults.","Positive"
"Went with a group of friends in October. The atmosphere was lovely. Halloween decorations were brilliant too!Only issue was the rides, after waiting for an hour we were told there was a fault   this happened to us 3 times    Also i was there 17 years ago as a child, most of the rides are the same, and the videos accompanying them too   some with deceased actors doing the documentary. People were very nice and friendly ! x","Neutral"
"Bring your best forever on your feet shoes. Double check the daily weather for the day. Make sure you wear sunblock and have extra cloths for the evening because when the sun goes down it gets cold. Always set time to be lined up especially if your plan on visiting during the weekend. We found it less crowded during the weekdays. Friday came and it was like the crowds were unleashed. Oh and go take a peak at the pin trading book in one of the stores so you can see why they trade pins and the oldest pins and the hidden pins   . MOST OF all HAVE FUN. We loved the parades and fire works   .","Neutral"

"Listen, we LOVE Disneyland.. we live in Utah and have annual passes.. we drive all the way just for a couple of days of escape and memories. We love everything about Disneyland EXCEPT the crowds... We research the best visit times posted on various sites that track that kind of thing, and what we have found is that it really doesn't matter what they say.. it is always shoulder to shoulder crowded, especially in the summer months.. mornings are better (till about 11am) but after that, and in the afternoons.. expect 50 to 75 minute waits at the popular attractions.We will always continue to go, but it would be really nice if they could figure out a way to limit the crowds so everyone had a great experience.. as it is now, most people tolerate the crowds and long lines, but the 'magic' of disneyland is being sucked out of the park by the huge crowds..","Neutral"
"My daughter her fiance and myself visited Disneyland in August last year in August, very very very disappointed!!! We live in Australia (Brisbane),so as you know we traveled a long long long way to visit Disneyland our plan was really just to visit Los Angeles as l am a huge huge huge huge Michael Jackson fan,but we thought we cannot go all the way to America and not visit Disneyland so we bought a 2 day park hopper thinking that we would need that long!!! We did not even stay 1 day,we were staying at Ho Jo across the road,that hotel was just alright have stayed in better. So any ways as we said very disappointed,very very over rated,the second day we were suppose to go back to Disneyland we opted out and paid for the day tour back to Los Angeles and did the Wax musuem and half day shopping trip instead that was a good tour our tour bus driver (Alex) was fantastic.We live not far from Gold Coast in Australia and our (One) off theme park Dreamworld and White Water Mountain is WAY WAY WAY better.I recommend that park to anyone even people who live in America.But hey do not get me wrong l absolutely LOVE LOVE America,Los Angeles is the most best place to visit.My father and myself are visiting again in September this year 2011,and cannot wait this will be my fathers first time to America so l will be going back to Disneyland again but will do it as my dad wants to visit,but we will be staying at the Fairfield Inn Marriott this time,looks better then HO Jo,when we went last year we ate at MiMi's cafe loved it will be eating there again this year!!! I recommend who ever reads this that if you ever get an opportunity to visit Australia visit Dreamworld you will not be disappointed!!!!!","Negative"
"The magic of Disney is not there  staff don't know what is happening and are not friendly. Children are pushed out of the way and the characters don't walk round anymore but stand somewhere and the queues are awful for young children to see the characters.

"We came on holiday with our 4 year old daughter from England. We had been to Disneyland Paris twice before but this place was the real deal! Being from Europe we especially appreciated the way in which the American people respected in others personal space in the queues.

"Disney in March is just too busy! Waiting 70 minutes or more for a ride is just not for me. I will never go back after enduring the crowds we dealt with. I know its more than rides but its not enough to bring me back. I thought the food was poor. We went on a Monday and Tuesday. Can't imagine the weekends. For 600 plus dollars for a family of 4 for 2 days it was too much to fight the crowds.","Neutral"
"As an East Coast resident who considers Walt Disney World my Disney  home,  I eagerly anticipated a trip to California which which would allow me to spend three days in Disney California Adventure and Disneyland Park.As a Disney fanatic and history buff, I was thoroughly immersed in the stories and history of the developments of Disneyland in the early 50s. I know most of the back stories of all the attractions, shows, and restaurants   even the ones that are no longer present.Still, to walk through the entrance gates and see the train station and flower Mickey for the first time was very special.Turning the corner onto Main Street, and looking down the street toward Sleeping Beauty Castle, I was instantly transported to the mental pictures of Walt Disney and his team bringing his vision of a  theme  park to reality.The Jungle Cruise was my first stop, and I had a great  skipper  who made the attraction a fun trip. Familiar with the story, I still enjoyed the corny jokes and sight gags.Pirates of the Caribbean was next, and once again, it was a great experience.I closed out that side of the park with the Haunted Mansion   all made up with the Holiday theme and Jack Skellington present.In each of these three attractions, I was very familiar with their origins and development. I have been on the WDW version of each of these, and count them my favorites there.However, I must say the experience of these three at Disneyland Park was unique, special, and different   not better, not worse, just different in the good kind of way.The highlight of my day was the various interactions with many Cast Members, who went about their roles with the spirit of Walt Disney very present; young or old, attraction host or custodial team, every single encounter I had ( and I spoke with dozens of Cast Members, because that's how I roll) through action and or language displayed what makes Disneyland unique among theme parks in general and the Disney properties specifically: this was  Walt's playground,  his crowning achievement in a very distinguished career.Somehow, just being in the place where Walt spent the last years of his life made all the difference in the world.I can't wait to go back!","Positive"
"Why can't you put lower than one star? We picked a Mon Ties Wed in August to try avoid crowds. How wrong we were. well the crowds were not bad, the manners of the crowds were bad. Awaiting the Maaterhorn we waited for hours while people in front of us let freinds and family into the line. we questioned a  cast memeber' and was told  what do you want us to do?  after over a 2 hour wait, we passed the sign that said 90 minute wait, We exited. The same thing happened on many rides. WE purchased a special picnic to asure us a good place to watch Worl of Color. Temp over 100 degress with no where to sit. 5 minutes before show they let in 100s of people in our special area. We had a good place to watch until 100s got in front of us. Same thing happened at fireworks sitting on hot pavement and then cast memebers tell us we could sit on ground. So we stood for 50 minutes. We had made a reservation for Carthey Circle Resturant, we arrived 10 minuts early and were told there would be a hour and 1 2 wait. Why take reservations? WE got fast passes for Cars at 8am, the fast pass was for 4pm. We got in line and still had to wait hours as we were told they wanted to clear up single line. When I arrived home I wrote a letter to Guest Relations, they wrote back, to say it was a corprate form letter would be a understatment. Asking why we didnt go to guest realtions in Town Sqaure, get out of line to complain about the long line and people allowing friends to enter Asked why we didnt talk to cast meember, I told them in letter I spoke to many cast members and NONE were very helpful. THen they had the nerve ( i think they were being funny) to give up front of line passes for rides, but they were not good on Matterhorn or Cars, the 2 rides I complained about. I guess they thougth they were being funny. They gave me the regualr BS about no refund, i reminded them that because something said no refund there are expections. If a non refubdable ticket on a plane is canceled they give you your money back, if you have opera tickets and it is cancaled you get your money back. I don't believe that they even read my letter, just did the old  send him excuse  5 letter . They should be ashamed of them selfs calling it Guest Relations. I will never go back and tell everyone how bad we wer treated by Disneyland. It is so clear Disneyland wants one thing  Your Money  once they have it they have no interest in helping anyone, WE spent over 700 dollars for 3 day passes. The Happest Place on Earth, they shoud be sued for false advirtising!","Negative"
"Disneyland has outlived its usefulness. We went there this morning and ended up turning around and going back home. It was 10:00 am Sunday morning. We currently have Premium level annual passports and definitely will not renew them. The hassle of getting there through the thousands of cars, getting shuffled out to park in the boondocks, waiting to get on a shuttle, standing in line once you get to the park to get in, and then standing in line all day for the attractions. Then there is the aggravation and overpricing for the mediocre food. I've had it!","Negative"
"I had a very unpleasant experience while I was visiting Disneyland Resort, Anaheim, on December 31, 2012, yes, it was New Year's Eve, and it was at around 11:30pm when I was trying to catch the New Year's countdown and fireworks at Disneyland (from 10:00pm ~ 11:20pm, I was in California Adventure Park to see the World of Color show). I would like to share my experience with you and hope there will be an improvement on Disneyland's procedure for multi day passes.I had a 5 day Park Hopper ticket and was re entering Disneyland park, I presented my ticket and my photo ID to the lady named Isabella (if I remember correctly), she was looking at my ticket and questioning me why the ink was not dark, I said I did not do anything to make the ink fade, in fact, I used the pen provided by Disneyland to write down my name on the ticket on the first day of my visit, after that, I just kept using my ticket, the ink was fading by itself, nothing I could do about it. She insisted on saying that the pen was the permanent mark, the ink should not fade at all. I said if the ink was fading, then the pen was really not a permanent mark. She asked me to step aside saying someone would check my ticket, I had no choice but to follow the order, however, I never expected I would wait for more than 10 ~ 15 minutes (it felt like forever) to get my ticket back. I was in a hurry to join the crowd for the countdown and fireworks, but the Disneyland lady and her lead seemed not caring about it at all.They took their time and did not even bother to care my concerns. I asked the lady when I could get my ticket back, and why it took so long to check the ticket, she simply answered  my lead had your ticket ...  with very arrogant, cold, and careless atitude, and no explanation on why it took so long. I said anxiously that I needed to catch the fireworks, but she DID NOT CARE AT ALL!!!All my family members got in with their tickets, but they had to wait for me, they really did not understand what was wrong with my ticket, my name was still there, just the ink was light, there was no sign on misusing of the ticket.Finally after a long time, her lead Robert came back and gave the ticket back to me, Isabella used a pen to put the new ink on my name. I asked Robert why it took so long to check my ticket, again he simply said  oh, I needed to validate your ticket ... . Okay, you could validate my ticket, but with the world class Disneyland park, it took more than 10 ~ 15 minutes to validate a ticket? and I was blocked at the door for almost 20 minutes in total from the beginning to the end. There were no apologies from Disneyland staff at all! I was so frustrated and upset.My whole family went to the City Hall and spoke to the management. We brought up our concerns seriously; while we were in the City Hall, we missed the countdown plus the beginning of the fireworks, we rushed to the outside and watched the fireworks from a not so good view point, my Dad missed the whole fireworks since he continued discussing our concerns with the manager.The incident totally ruined our New Year's Eve celebration at Disneyland which was the most important part of our visit, and I just do not understand why I should be punished while it was not my fault at all? If anything was wrong, it was the pen, the pen was provided by the Disneyland Park, I had nothing to do with it. Because of the poor  permanent mark , it wasted my and my family members' precious 20 minutes on New Year's Eve, plus the time to report our concerns.I visited Disneyland, LA, two times in 2011 with my 5 day and 6 day tickets, I enjoyed my visits and felt the Disneyland staff was so friendly and well trained. But the experience I had in 2012 destroyed my good impression on Disneyland completely. We already felt a lot of inconvenience of showing both the tickets and the ID's in 2012, and then on top of it, a lot of suspicions and distrust. I paid $300 for my ticket, and I did not think I should be treated like that way.I really feel a new solution should be come up to respond to this situation. I saw some other guests with the valid tickets were blocked at the entrance too; to me, that experience is the ultimate insult and humiliation. I always use valid tickets, and with the tickets I was never ever blocked at the door anywhere else except Disneyland. We were coming for the happiness, but not for the distrustfulness, the interesting thing was, after that lady rewrote my name on the ticket using the pen, a couple of days later, the ink faded again! I still have my ticket with the faded ink.Disneyland did not have a good procedure for the multi day tickets, the current procedure is not working!! the pen was not actually a permanent mark, therefore, Disneyland should take the consequence, but not me, not the guests!!!","Negative"
"After visiting the Disney World resort in Orlando last year, I was quite disappointed by the level of customer service offered at the Paris resort. First of all there was no free wi fi on offer in the main parks. All the parks including the water parks of the Orlando Resort offered DisneyGuest wi fi. As a guest, you were encouraged to download a Disneyland app, but this wasn't possible without either being a French resident or buying overseas roaming data from your mobile provider. Secondly, I was disappointed by the long queue time for meeting a Disney princess. In Orlando, you were able to meet three at once by joining a much shorter queue that did not require a reservation pass which you also had to queue for in the Paris resort. And finally, after checking out of Davy Crockett Ranch, we were hoping to use the pool one last time before catching the ferry back to the UK. However, we were told that this was not allowed as we had already checked out. I'm places such as Centre Parcs, you are able to use the pool facilities for a few hours after checking out of your accommodation.","Neutral"
"This was not my first visit at Disneyland Paris. I always love it. All the details, the music etc. But this time I noticed things weren  t as good as always. It was very very bussy. That of course isn  t Disney  s fault. But they didn  t anticipate on that. No extra cleaning at the restrooms. They were very very dirty. People were smoking in the lines cast members saw it but didn  t say anything about it.What was great this visit was the new night spectacle Dreams. Very very very beautifull.","Neutral"
"We visited the park for the very first time. This was our first trip to California and felt Disneyland was an absolute must. We have visited Disney world in Florida several times and my review compares to trips there. I would not return to this park in the future. I felt as though the park was way understaffed for this high week in tourism. The lines were tremendously long as you would anticipate but very few staff controlling crowd movement thru the park. It didn   t feel as though it was a well run Disney machine like we have experienced in the past. Along with the mob feeling we had we noticed this park is not kept as clean as Florida. Again I would attribute this to the lack of proper staffing. It felt like the higher ups just said stuff as many people in here as we can and we will just blame it on vacation week. I would honestly spend the money on something else while in California. ","Neutral"
"I came here when it first opened and I was a child. Since then I've been to Florida twice. I brought my 3 year old and she loved it. I think it lacked the magic of Florida, the cleanliness and overall upkeep is so different. People smoking everywhere, cigarette ends on the floor. I know that's not the fault of the park but no one enforces rules. There are queues for queues. The food stations are chaotic and slow. The park itself isn't very big and some things are looking tired, cracked floor tiles etc. There were ride closures which I understand but maybe too many at one time? There are good points, the parade was fantastic. The characters came over to interact with the crowds. The light firework display was also brilliant! I don't know if I'll return again. It is good for small children. But I think I'll save my money for Florida.","Neutral"
"I would like to start by stating that I have never been to prison but I imagine it would feel the same. So you get to the park entrance by car at 8.30 and only half of the pay desks for your rip off 20euro carpark ticket are open and the queue is HUGE. At least 75 cars. The walk through gates aren't too bad if you don't take a bag but get ready to empty your pockets . .Don't faff about holding people up by trying to go through a  no bag  queue with a bag!!!! Then you rush to get your first  Fast pass  ticket, the time being 9.10am okay, the park only open for just over an hour remember. The ticket time was 11.10am. So, time to go and do a couple of rides right?? WRONG. You get to your first queue to see that its 90mins long. . .How can a queue be 90mins long when the park has only been open for 60mins??? Oh, thats right, because they only run one car for an hour so the queue builds up and you have to be there for two days not one, how silly of me!!!! And that was how the day went on, even a half hour queue for a disgusting soggy cold crepe'. Next day (knowing how long the queues would be and getting two day tickets) we got to the entrance at 8.10am to find, yep, you've guessed it, TWO gates open . . .And about 50 cars queuing. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PS, the rides were okay.","Negative"
"I took my family of 5 (kids 7,11, & 13) for two days to Disneyland Paris (April 2nd and 3rd). I was able to get a good package deal where we stayed at Nature Villages, got a meal plan and 2 days tickets to the parks. However, I found the parks very underwhelming. Definitely prefer the Disney parks in the USA over this one. There were many rides closed (including Hyperspace Mtn, Autotopia, Haunted Mansion, etc). Twice when we got on rides we waited in line, got almost to the ride, and they came overhead and announced that there was a technical difficulty and the ride was now closed (Thunder Mtn and Crush's Coaster). I expect more than this from Disney.Also, while I enjoyed the food that came on the meal plan  the afternoon meal was a full on 3 course meal. HOWEVER, please know that you MUST make a reservation at the qualifying restaurant. One day we had no trouble getting one on the spot, but on the next day everyone was already booked. So MAKE SURE YOU MAKE RESERVATIONS AHEAD of time if you do the meal plan, or plan to eat at the restaurants in general.As for the parks, we definitely enjoyed the Studios side vs Disneyland. We found the park small enough that we didn't need to be there the whole day. Which was fine  we went to the hotel and swam at the waterpark.Anyhow, if you don't feel like you NEED to take your kids to amusement park, skip Disneyland Paris. There's too many other fun things to do in Paris to waste your time at this park. If you want to go to an amusement park, we much preferred Europapark in Rust, Germany.","Neutral"

"I first went to  disney Land in Floriday 20 years ago and at that time it seem dated and poor versus the other parks in Floriday. 21 years later it's exactly the same and now seems very dated with a large number of terrible rides that people are willing to queue for over an hour for what they can get at their local fairground. Basically, one big rip off with very few Mickey's and Minnies walking round for autographs and as per most things Parisian expensive and terrible service.","Negative"
"I've been countless times since the opening in 1992,and am still mesmerized when I enter the pard for the first time when I visit,it just feels like coming home,letting your inner child out,and just have fun,these parks and its crowds can be daunting,so I always feel a good preparation is recommended,make sure you understand what a fastpas is and how it works,that (if you stay in a Disney hotel) you get up early to make use of early morning magic (2 hours of Discoveryland and fantasyland, without queues!!And if you'd like to eat your diner sitting down, make sure you figure out beforehand which restaurant and price tag has your interest and make reservations!! However busy the parks are, I always manage to work around the big crowds.I do hope they will bring back a night time parade,and a big show in the Disneyland park,even if it is Tarzan again ,there are few tot none shows in the main park these days.Then again , the nighttime show Dreams is a ma zing,just be careful not to sit or stand behind someone who plans to film the thing with an Ipad.. it's like someone is holding up a flatscreen tv in front of your face.. not fun.Looking forward to the new Ratatouille attraction this summer!!!","Positive"
"We go to Disney a lot, once a year usually and we go to Disney world. We just went in October but we were in the Area so we figured we would scope out Disneyland.The first thing I notice is the staff is not near as nice or polished. Is this Really Disney I kept asking myself. The entrance to the park is forced through downtown Disney and a TSA like probe.....Entering the park does not seem magical at all, where is the music and the happy people? The attractions were nice and I appreciate the rides were different than Orlando even the rides with the same names had variations that make it worth the trip.The food seems much more expensive a slice of pizza for 8 bucks rather than the ability to purchase a whole pizza for 20 is insane. So smiles from the cast they all seem beat down and depressed.The park offers little shade and it's miserable walking around in the afternoon. The castle is so much smaller and there is a huge shortage or places to eat.I would never go back to Disney if Disneyland were their only park. I will continue to visit Disney World","Neutral"
"I have been to Disneyland and Disneyworld several times. It used to be that Disneylands charm and simplicity kept it somewhat competitive with its larger, Florida based cousin. Now, its not even close. Disneyworld seems to have an endless budget to help your kids get lost in the fantasy...especially characters dressed up everywhere. At Disneyland, we only saw two characters the entire day. The biggest difference is that because 'Land is in the middle of the same 20 million people every day, its not just a target destination for traveling families, but  frequent fliers  who are no where near as polite. At allmost every line someone would cut in front, and the employees just watched. It was very upsetting to have your toddlers and children patiently wait 40 minutes, then have to watch (typically locals) people just step in front at the last second. If you say anything, you make a scene if front of your kids. If you dont, you are not a good role model. I didnt pay several hundreds of dollars to have to deal with that...the employees should. As your kids get older, Disney overall isnt as much fun. There are only a couple of  thrill  rides, as compared to other amusement parks which have several.Having said all of that, the park is clean and the kids had a good time.","Negative"
"The parade and fireworks are worth while to see.The facilities here are not attractive, cute or fun as Disneyland California, only a few duplicated facilities as California one. I guess that's reason why.Most of the food meals restaurants of amusement parks are expensive and distasteful. The food and meals of restaurants in Disneyland HK are delicious, that surprised me.If you wanna visiting Disneyland in an economy way, and do not hate hot humid weather, I'd recommend you to visit here.","Neutral"
"We were looking forward to our visit to Disneyland. We were highly disappointed. Complete waste of money. Disneyland is nothing like Disney world. We knew it wouldn   t be the same; but we were at least hoping to feel the same magic. We did not. We did not see any characters the whole time we were there. The only thing this park cares about is selling it   s merchandise. Whether it be disney or Star Wars merchandise, it was being pandered everywhere. The park is overcrowded. Ride lines are outrageous. Even with maxpass you wait over two hours. The Pixar parade was a joke. Only 20 minutes long. Food prices are through the roof. Never again will we visit a Disney resort or property. Time to move on to universal studios.","Negative"
"Disneyland!!! Need I say more???   Lines were short, food was great and the staff were sooo friendly and enthusiastic. DO NOT MISS the PAINT THE NIGHT PARADE and of course the fireworks. It really is the happiest place on earth","Positive"
"I had a blast. I have never been to any Disneyland so I don   t know what to expect. I guess I was just blown away by the excitement and the child in me so I soaked in everything with big smiles and just be happy about it. The entrance is easy, as we took the shuttle bus from the Disneyland Resort hotel. Walk for 10 mins and reached the gate. I bought tix online and redeemed easily thru the hotel guest gate. So were our meal coupons. The park is huge, and i   m glad that they have this train circling the park. It was almost Christmas and it was Sunday so the pack was there. Average 30 50 mins to wait for a ride, but we went for a Fast Pass for the Iron Man Expo, which was awesome. Had late lunch at Royal Banquet Hall and the steak did not disappoint.Do not miss the parades and the fireworks, it made our day even more spectacular and we went back to hotel extremely tired, but happy! Kudos to the team behind all the shows. I will be back and try other Parks too!","Positive"
"Long waits if you didn't use the fast pass system.  I wouldn't come again during the Spring Break season.","Neutral"
"Disney customer service used to be second to none. That has changed and it's disappointing.The park is overcrowded and cast members seem to despise their jobs. You never used to hear them chit chatting among themselves but I was privy to a conversation between two workers in Toon town discussing how understaffed they were, and how one requested full time but didn't get it, and blah blah. The ride CMs seem especially annoyed by the guests, but I guess with so many guests and not enough employees...in fact our Star Tours ride was delayed because one guest was left without a seat.Walt would be very very sad to see what's become of Disneyland...the magic is gone and I won't pay thousands of dollars when I can get the same level of service for less at Knotts OR even better service for less at Universal! Yes, Universal now surpasses Disneyland for customer service (California Adventure is still superior though!)","Negative"
"Disney Paris is nice. I always feel happy when I go to disney. Thing is, some of the rides are in french. Also, I have been to disney orlando before and Orlando seemed bigger and better. The positive thing about it is that the evening firework show is extraordinary. Food is not that great in parks. Also, in the middle of the day, you can take the RER C train to Val Europe station where you can have a nice lunch in the mall and visit Val d'europe outlet which is nice.","Neutral"
"Disneyland paris is magical loved everything about it apart from the queues booked for next year loved it","Positive"
"Overall fairly disappointed with the park. Some areas not well kept. eg. on exiting it's a small world the lawned areas had not been cut and full of weeds. ( just an observation) The days we were there the parks felt almost over crowded. In the Studios in particular many of the eating places were closed. There were long queues even for the ladies toilets. In the men's toilets there were at least 6 ladies in front of me in line to use them. Most of the toilets I used were dreadful and not being maintained. ( have seen better standards in porta loos at a pop festival !!We queued for ages even for some of the smallest of rides for the young children 30   40 minfor a 90 second roundabout ride. Most of the larger rides were at least an hour and a half.Even 10 min. after the official opening time there was a 2 hour wait for the tower of terror.We made the most of our time, but it was not the magical experience we had hoped for our two young grand children's first Disney visit. Unlike our first visit with our own daughter to Florida many years ago, which was near perfect and we always remember fondly. We have been back to Florida on 5 occasions and the standards are always high.One final warning, seems if you are carrying anything other than a Disney carrier bag ...beware!at 11o'clock at night, after 13 hours in the park with two young and very tired children. As we were leaving, we were dragged out of the madding crowd just outside the park by security and hauled to one side and being demanded to produce receipts for every item we had purchased in in park. (almost all children's toys) Even the hats our grandsons had on their heads. Much of which we had purchased the day before, with the receipts being back at the hotel.When we asked why with literally thousands and thousands of other people pushing past us at that very moment all rushing to get to their buses and cars, most dressed up in hats and ears and ...... well you get the picture! Why we were pulled over (and this guy was trying to look in our bags as well) We were advised it was because one of our carrier bags was one the we had brought with us and not an official Disney carrier bag!!!!! I am a very patient person but believe me, it would have been well worth the assault charge to deck the brainless jobsworth.When he saw how angry he was making us he backed off.What a way to totally kill what had been a very frustrating day anyway.Disneyland Paris really just do not have it right and are doing the magic of Disney no good at all.","Neutral"
"After hearing about Disneyland for most of my life my partner and I finally got the chance to go there. Had some amazing views however it is better suited to kids. Bringing your kids here is a must!","Positive"
"The park really should have a Will Call line to pick up tickets. Instead, I had to wait nearly an hour in line with people who didn't know what they want. My two minute transaction should have taken just that long: two minutes. Instead, I wasted precious time in line, and there's just no reason for it. As a 'process person', this kind of thing drives me crazy.","Neutral"
"Attraction are not a lot.   Klook is a cheapest way to buy a ticket but recommend to not buy a value meal and reason is in a photo i share.  About popcorn is not good cooked.","Negative"
"Collecting fast passes for rides that didn't work. Queuing for rides that haven't work. The maintenance is abysmal to say the least. High profit very low quality return. Thunder mountain out of action, space mountain out of action.140 euros for two days  you will need them! Sadly not due to the vast array of rides but more so dealing with the problems and issues associated with the park!I've been on three rides today and eaten an overpriced burger with questionable meat content  Angus! Better quality at McDonald's.Hopefully day 2 will bring more joy!","Negative"
"I have been to Disneyland many times over the last 20 years so I know how it used to be. It's sad that over those visits, the experience has gotten progressively worse. Way overcrowded and expensive. Quality of food was poor. And what happened to variety? Our last visit to the Orlando park 2 years ago was disappointing and we said we would never visit Disneyland again. But we did only because we travelled half way around the world with friends who had never been before. It was embarrassing that we recommended the visit thinking it would be still be magical for first timers.We visited on a Tuesday, low season as it were. So many rides were broken down or under maintenance. Fantasmic was under maintenance (there was nothing to replace that) and there were no fireworks. Only on weekends, they said. Stood in line for Big Thunder Mountain for almost an hour and that broke down. Got a Fast Pass at 2pm to return to Space Mountain at 8pm only to have that break down as well. All they said was sorry and no idea when it would be fixed. People were angry and yelling at the staff. I felt sorry for them as it's not their fault but they handled the situation badly. Staff were clearly over worked and not happy. Parents were frustrated. Kids were impatient standing in line for hours. Happiest place on Earth? Definitely not. There used to be Disney cast around every corner but on this visit, we saw only Pluto and that was on our way out at 9pm. It wasn't Disneyland. It was a Disney themed park, at best. With lots of Disney merchandise to make up for the missing cast if anyone is interested in parting with a lot of money. This is it. Never again Disneyland.","Negative"
"My daughters and I visited Disneyland Paris for the first time and were a little disappointed. Living in Florida and having DisneyWorld in our backyard I was careful not to hold Disneyland Paris to the standards of the U.S. park so we went in with open minds. I knew it was a scaled down version of DisneyWorld so we approached everything with that in mind, however there was something missing from this park... the Disney Magic!! The castle was beautiful and loved being able to walk around on the inside and enjoyed seeing Disneyland Paris versions of some of the attractions we have at Disneyworld. We really enjoyed the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Carribean. Space Mountain was closed down, which I knew before we went, but it seemed like maybe June is their off season, because a lot of restaurants and food vendors were also closed. The employees just didn't seem to have the  cast member  attitude we have experienced at DisneyWorld. We did a Disneyland Express tour from Paris which is endorsed by DisneyLand Paris. Am I glad we went... yes so that I can say I did, would we go back... probably not.","Neutral"
"This was our first trip to Disney with our young children   a big surprise for them, they seemed to be content, but our 10 year old was looking a little bit disappointed, especially after queing for an hour for the star wars ride, which was not particularly exciting.The whole day was not helped by it being bitterly cold, and sitting watching the stunt show was getting to be dangerously cold, the staff do not appear to know how to read an audience and speed things up! There seemed to be nowhere to go to get out of the cold unless it was a shop and then in the few eateries that were open there were only a couple of people serving, so MORE queuing. The parade was worth seeing but have to agree with somebody else here who said the staff look miserable. We were hoping to stay for the fireworks by having dinner there, but when we saw the prices in the restaurants decided to head back to our hotel. Although the children enjoyed having 'been to Disneyland', we left feeling it was just a huge money making machine.","Neutral"
"Having spent three days at the Disneyland Paris resort, I have nothing but praise for the Park, the entertainers, and the sheer magic of the Park. We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel, and it was superb..My only complaint is with the food in the actual Park, huge lines, expensive, and the food was stone cold..The Disney name stands for quality, tradition, and is known the world over for it's love of children, and keeping the magic alive. Why would Disney endorse this dreadful food? If Disney needs to put the emphasis, and focus on the entertainment, hotels, etc, (Which it does with the most amazing stunning detail, quality, and perfection) Why can't you put the horrible food, served under your name and flagship, out to tender? McDonalds would be better than stone cold food..slow service, and disappointment.  This is the ONLY aspect that gives cause for complaint, and it does take some of the magic away..and leave a nasty taste..literally.","Negative"
"This Disneyland is by far the smallest of all. The place is catered for mainly for the Chinese mainlanders. I estimate that 90% of the crowd are from China. I have no issue with this but I do have an issue with overcrowding though it is not as bad as the one in Tokyo. The average wait in HK Disneyland is about 40  45 min for each rideI had visited this about 10 years ago and I did not notice any significant change in its attractions. ","Negative"
"Personally I prefer this to the Studios, when we went there were lots of reforms going on. Bit of a let down although we did know about them before we went. Check whats being updated as that will alter your experience. The Pirates ride broke when we were on and they had to turn the lights on, spoilt the experience. Staff all ran round like headless chickens,,,was quite funny! Staff lack the Disney Magic so make your own. Food expensive and a lot of people take their own baguettes.","Neutral"
"Hong Kong travel is not completer without Disneyland. I felt like I was a kid again. Very good for family and friends for a day tour and fun activities. Lovely just lovely! Whole day here is like a whole new world of fantasy, love and happiness.","Positive"
"i honestly didn't expect this place to be this amazing for a 19 year old since it's main target is younger children but it turned out to be just perfect for me and my girlfriend.it might be a little expensive but trust me, it's totally worth it!you need at least 2 3 days to check out the whole park cause it's simply huge! I actually thought 2 days would be enough but really, it's a lot! and you should always keep in mind that there is a lot of queue time but you can always buy a fastpass (it costs extra money) and waiting is not that boring after all. the attractions vary a lot from carrousels to the wildest rollercoasters.there are souvenir shops all over the place but don't buy the first souvenir you'd like to have cause there are a lot and they are really expensive!when i was there, there was a beautiful light show projected on the castel which took about 20 30 minutes. you should really get a nice spot to see the show like 20 minutes before because it will be crowded with people and offcourse dads with their child on their shoulders so that you can't see a thing anymore....","Positive"
"We have been to Disneyworld in Florida 4 times and once in Eurodisney in Paris. Disneyland California was such a disappointment in comparison. Pirates of the Carribean closed. Matterhorn broke down after a 40 minute wait just as we got into toboggan. Went Indiana Jones. After 30 minute wait the ride broke down. Went later on in the day waited 40 minutes got to the entrance ride broke down again. Areas of the park closed for beautification. But above all it lacked the magical experience we have become used to with Disney.Cast members seemed disinterested. Is it not time to replace Captain EO. Played to theatre which was a quarter full. It was so dated. Disneyland California needs major investment. Its a Small World closed. Finding Nemo closed","Negative"
"Came feb half term. NEVER AGAIN. Like previous reviewers have stated, be prepared to queue! To get your bags searched(I took in a carrier bag of snacks and it was fine) to get into the main entrance, to get fast passes, to buy a drink and not forgetting, to get on the rides. I can laugh now, but at the time it is completely SOUL DESTROYING. You were looking at anything between 40 to 90 minutes wait times. Not fun when you have to explain it to a bored 6 year old why you are waiting every 5 mins, with the cold seeping into your bones, this would wear anyone's patience down. We queued for phantom manor for 40 mins and then nothing! The queue just stopped moving. We were stood there like lemons not knowing what was happening, no one came to tell us anything. In the end we had wasted enough time so left like everyone else and asked the lady at the gate, she was very smiley and said it was a technical fault and it would be up and running in 2 minutes. Too late! We had already lost our place in the queue. I wanted to punch her in the face. What rides we did get on we enjoyed, esp crush's coaster, and the ratatouille ride. We managed a few fast passes, when we could get them. Food looked overpriced and mass produced. Take lots of snacks with you you'll need them in the never ending queues. We left to eat in the village, much better but a pain to walk there and back again. I thought the French attendants were nice and polite, they could teach the staff at Alton towers a thing or 2, and the park from what I could see was clean. But they have to sort out the broken seats on rides and queue times, my intention on going to disney was to be happy, not to feel as much anger as I did! Overall I won't be coming again for a long time, it was such a dissapointing and stressful visit, and I didn't feel the magic I first felt when I visited 15 years ago.","Neutral"
"Never been to Disneyland (other than Disney California two days prior) and had a pretty good day! Fantastic shopping and the cool Halloween stuff happening at the tjme. Good as but the other park is more for adults with bigger rides so enjoyed that way more.Each to their own!","Neutral"
"I am a disney lover, so I did love going to a new park. The parades, shows, christmas decorations, and character greetings lacked some of the special disney effects I have known to love. The parade was short, the show was small and simplistic, and there was a significant lack of characters in general. The rides themselves were very fun. They are a lot more intense then magic kingdom rides, so be prepared!

"Disneyland as expected was great. Fastpass is the way to go and you can get these fro free. Arrive early and do the major rides before 11 than check out all the fastpass times. Get your passes (the rides show the times) and go from ride to ride with no queue. Great performing arts theatre for lunch with beautiful menu selections which were big   buy less meals than you think you will need. Ride breakdowns were disappointing specially after queuing to find the ride had to close when you were almost there ( this happened on day 1 before we knew about fastpass) but the staff were good and did issue passes to come back at anytime without queuing. The kids were wowed","Positive"
"Disney used to be a great place to go visit with kids. I don't know what has changed but we were recently there and it was terribly crowded the last few years. Disney World seems to be better organized but it still crazy to spend the money you do to only get to go to a handful or less of rides per visit. I was extremely disappointed in Disney Adventure Land. There were no fast passes available after a certain point. We arrived late to the park and only got to 2 rides. Wait times were 1 2 hours. Standing around with children for that long is not easy. If you venture here be prepared for the crowds.","Negative"
"At between $80   $112 per person for a one day pass, you would think that it must be good at the cost. In reality, we went on January 3rd which was still the US school holidays, and only managed to get on 2 basic rides during the whole day with the kids due to the queues. Its a lot smaller than Floridas Disneyworld   so large volumes of people make it unmanageable. The average fast pass availability was 4hrs later than the ticket issue   and we got there at 10am and spent an hour parking and getting in. Simply joining a line for a ride without a fastpass meant an average of 50   80 minutes, which was too much for kids under 7 to tolerate. We ended up just riding around on the park train and having a burger   which proved to be the most expensive fast food given that we could have went ot a Burger King outside and saved $500 for a family of four. It seems that many local residents have annual passes so just go for a day out at no extra cost, so it means foreign visitors pay a premium for a disappointing service. They should really consider applying a capacity limit so that you can have a reasonable chance of benefiting from what is an expensive day out with no guarantee of even getting on many rides. you could hardly even walk around, very disappointing.","Negative"
"We hadn't been to Disneyland since before the turn of the century and it will most likely be another 20 years before we come back again. We've been to Disney World and Disneyland Tokyo and this was the worst of the three. Guess we've been spoiled by Disney World. We've gotten use to getting our photo's taken at the end of rides and then having the photo either sent to our hotel or the front gate to be picked up after we're done for the day, but not at the end of Splash Mountain, we had to pack it with the rest of our purchase to the front lockers (located outside of the gates) and stash it there until our departure. Two of the rides that we wanted to go on were closed for  Decorating    can't they do that at night when the park is closed? It would also be nice to provide the  Military Discount  tickets at the gate, especially if you have no way of getting to a base to buy the discount tickets. Also, we didn't find that many photographers as we found at Disney World, they are usually tied up with the characters inside, not the outside ones. We didn't bring a camera besides our cell phones since at Disney World since there's always one there. We won't be back for awhile here.","Negative"
"I went to Disneyland for the first time, I have never been in a US attraction park before so I don't have a comparison. I went in the winter and while it was pretty cold (about 4 5 degrees celcius) it was bearable. It had the added advantage that there was not much waiting at the attractions. The price for the entrance is pretty high (50 EUR) but once you are in there is lots to do. You definitely get somethign for your money. I must say the staff were very friendly, only one or two incidents and they were minor. The majority of the staff were very friendly, smiling and helpfull. Once in the park one is truly in another world. One can hardly see anything outside the park and the worst part is the rude awakening when taking the metro home. Watch out for the metro tickets as they are more expensive than a normal ticket and we got fined when arriving in MArne la Valee as we thought our regular tickets would work there. i also suggest you buy the return ticket immediately since the queu was horrendous.I am not putting and  Excellent  comment due to the food. The service and food in the fastfood restaurants is just pathetic. Any McDonalds is better than what exists here. They are slow, badly organized and the food quality litterally sucks. The price for a burger, fries and a drink is minimally 10 EUR per menu which is double what McD charges and theirs are a lot better, plus they are organized for speed. My biggest disappointment was the food, even the doughnut I bought was dry and the coffee was really bad. Frankly this being Paris   a country known for good food and pastry it is not excusable for Disneyland to have such low standards at those prices. I am willing to pay their surcharged prices but they need to do something about organizing their speed of service and quality. This place should have a starbucks or maybe 5, a few REAL fastfood restaurants like McD or any other. They need to overhaul that sector because it kills the otherwise magical experience that Disneyland is. Overall I had a fantastic day   it was fun, it was cute, it was stunning and I will definitely return.","Positive"
"I genuinely believe that some people only post here to complain and that nothing will ever be good enough for them.Myself and my partner (both in our 30s) have visited the park twice now, and both times we have come away full of praise and great memories and a longing to go back as soon as it's possible.Yes there are queues, deal with it, it's a theme park. If you have issues queuing, then perhaps a theme park holiday is not for you? Standard theme park advice says do the  big  rides at clever times (mealtimes, park closing etc.) as most people will be doing other things at these times. As much as I am well aware that families cannot visit when they want, due to school term time etc, choosing the quieter times and not going in june july august will definately help with crowds and it's well worth bearing in mind as visiting in the  off  season will also help to reduce the cost of your holiday.In terms of the ride area closures, DLRP makes publically available a list of attractions that will be closed and the timescale they will be closed for, at least 6 months in advance. Also, surely it's better to close a ride for maintenance than risk injury to a guest? If I'm wrong here, please feel free to comment, but I'm sure you'd rather a ride be closed than a loved one suffer injury because they kept the ride open.The main reason a lot of attractions are closed at the moment is that DLRP has identified that they need to renovate areas of the park (partly in preparation for 2016 being the 25th anniversary of the park), and due to the nature of this work areas cannot be open to guests whilst heavy machinery is in situ. With one notable exception every member of staff has been friendly and has at least made the effort to speak English to me (I do speak a reasonable level of French so I've never had an issue communicating with them) and they cannot do enough to help you out when you have a concern query. Although I do have to question, if you are going to France, surely some flexibility in language has to be expected both on the staff members part and the tourist, you are in their country remember!! If you don't want to deal with other languages cultures there are 2 fine disney parks in the USA which are predominately English speaking.The rides shows are presented in multiple languages, you may have to wait a little longer to get a show in your chosen language, but they are available if you keep your eyes out on the ample sign boards around the park rides. All in all, we've never had a bad experience being at DLRP and will be visiting again many many more times in the years to come. It's a great escape from real life and the whole place is set up to help you forget  normal life  and allow yourself to be absorbed into the world of Disney. Granted, we never expect perfection, but this place gets pretty damn close.As a side note, for those people visiting from the UK specifically, it is well worth doing Disney as a self drive holiday if you have the option, DLRP is roughly a 3.5 hr drive from Calais and the freedom you'll have to visit Paris or the surrounding area and it's attractions or just to simply not be restricted by baggage weight when travelling to from can be invaluable.TLDR??   Stop whinging about the place, and just enjoy your holiday. Nothing Nobodys perfect!!!!","Positive"
"On our last day, several rides were broken on top of the 2 rides closed for refurbishment. Extremely frustrating.","Positive"
"The park was very busy on Saturday and Sunday and was made busier due to multiple rides being closed for refurbishment including Haunted Mansion, Matterhorn, Splash Mountain and Winnie the Pooh. We were able to have a good time late at night on Sunday and early in the morning on Monday. The rest of the time was way too busy.","Neutral"
"First off, if you have been to Disneyland in California or Disney world in Florida you will be a bit disappointed. My Wife and I took a side trip to Hong kong for a couple of days on our way back home to California. I always wanted to see how the different Disneyland properties differ outside of the U.S. First and foremost DO NOT compare this place to any of the Disneyland parks in the US, you will just hate your visit. The best way to get here is by MTR. there is a station that drops you off at the main entrance. We Came from Kowloon so it only took less than 30mins during the morning rush...not bad. If you do plan on coming here go visit the Big Buddha and the Monastery first and do Disneyland in the afternoon. The park entrance fee is about $55US. At first glance as you stand at the front you will swear that your at Disneyland or the Magic Kingdom in Florida, but thats where it ends. It's packed, and i mean packed! We really didnt go on much of the rides because of the lines...2 hours is way to long to wait. It's fun to try the diffrent foods they have here...like Fish balls...at DISNEYLAND?!?! awesome. The pictures was pretty much the highlight of the trip to HK Disneyland. Pros  it's unique, it's the cheapest i've ever paid to get into Disneyland. There is no shortage of people willing to take your photo..not just one shot..maybe 2, 5, 17..lol. The staff is very friendly. Cons  It's expensive inside the park. $45 for a sweater?!?! it's small...really small. People just walk right in front of you when your taking a picture..so freaking rude! it's crowded.You can finish the park in less than 4 hours.","Neutral"
"Long awaited first family visit to Disney, was disappointed that there was roughly five of the large rides under refurbishment which was very disappointing as I don't think we would have gone knowing there was such a lot of rides out of action. Food expensive but that was expected.Security was high but I think that was a positive knowing there doing there best to keep us safe.","Negative"
"The Cast members where not what I remember them being like, few smiled, only 3 commented on buttons and ears. The cast members have last their magic that Disney is known for, It was like going to an over priced theme park.","Negative"
"It was extremely hot weather in June so avoid summer time.The place is small so it is manageable for family with young children.Go straight to Fantasyland if your kids are below 6 so you can go for most rides.The night parade was worth to watch but a bit disappointed that we didn't get to see any Disney characters walking about for photo taking.Castle is also closed so no fireworks at night.","Neutral"
"Yes, Disneyland has a magic all its own which requires no introduction. Attractions such as Space Mountain, Star Tours 3D and Thunder Mountain are all as memorable as they are breathtaking, however, all time between these attractions was spent being jostled about and almost being bowled over by aggressive mothers pushing impossibly large strollers. Seriously, what is an infant going to remember or appreciate about a visit to Disneyland? Make sure you visit the main attractions listed above, make time for the Dumbo ride, as well as the Mad tea party (our personal favourite; quirky and with slightly malicious musical effects) and get out as quickly as you can. If you intend on staying for the fireworks display, be prepared to be seated and hemmed in well before 2130, otherwise you will spend the rest of the time being marshalled about in smiling but unyielding style by the grinning staff in a never ending gymkhana to nowhere.","Negative"
"We came from out of state for the Halloween Party, a special event for us as we have always wanted to visit the Haunted Mansion with Jack Skellington in residence.That was a great moment, seeing the mansion and the ride was fabulous.The crowds were massive on a Friday night, especially between 4 7pm when the daytime visitors are in the park and the doors open for the party goers. There are rope lines set up to help with lines into the rides and handing out candy. With the crowds as huge as when we went, we watched as people were blocked off by massive crowds on one side and no way to get out due to the crazy rope lines on the other, people started to panic down by the haunted mansion area, going under the rope lines to escape and only to get berated by park employees for  cutting in line  , ridiculous! It took 45 minutes to get a bag of popcorn, the soda we waited 15 minutes to buy ran out of syrup. We had dinner at the Blue Bayou and had to wait a half an hour beyond our reservation time. The Pirates ride, Thunder Mountain AND Indian Jones ALL broke down at the same time in the same area of the park, that did not help with crown control AT ALL. The young people working in the park are simply not trained to handle crowds like this either. Customer service overall slips, as everyone appears to fall into survival mode including employees. It was crazy, we left early. Conversely, we have had a GREAT time at the Halloween party in WALT DISNEY WORLD.We all came away thinking this park is too small for these size crowds, and that the customer service in general was not even close to being on par with what we have always received in Florida. This visit hurt our perception of the Magical Disney experience, big time. We are hoping this is a one off event, but it has tarnished our feelings about Disney overall, believe it or not. We are DVC members, we love going to WDW in Florida. We just can't get over how California Disney leadership and management didn't plan better. You know, it's like this is not supposed to happen at a Disney park. You are supposed to feel safe, happy and carefree. Yikes!","Negative"
"Last week we went on a much anticipated trip to Disneyland Paris, to celebrate my 30th birthday, as I am a huge Disney fan, and a big kid at heart. I had visited Disneyland Paris four times previously, between 1992 and 2008, and had always had a magical trip. Sadly, this trip did not live up to my magical expectations, and I'm afraid to say I will not visit Disneyland Paris again. We stayed at Davy Crockett Ranch. Immediately on arriving we were disappointed by the amount of building work going on around the site, it looks unpleasant, untidy, and certainly not magical. The cabin itself was adequate, we did have an ant infestation however upon asking this was seen to, a bug bomb was put in the cabin whilst we were out and we didn't see any more. We were surprised there was no toaster, neither was there a grill to make toast. The equipment in the cabin was poor, and added to the feeling that we were constantly being encouraged not to eat in the self catering accommodation, instead spending our money in the parks. There was some confusion when booking as one of the Disney sites advertised a Premium Plus cabin, the other only a Premium. This was not fully explained to me and I was under the impression our cabin included free wired internet, the receptionist would not budge on this and said we would have to pay. The  village  area of the camp looked a state, with scaffolding and dust everywhere. The pool was closed all day Tuesday, then on Wednesday we called Reception, who couldn't tell us if it was open, so we went down there anyway, checked in and given no advice, to get into the pool and find the Jacuzzi, flume and rapids were all broken. The pool was a big draw for us and so this was extremely disappointing and we did not visit again. On the Thursday my parents tried to visit the bar at 2pm, only to be shouted at that it was closed.  Overall, the lack of facilities, equipment, and the general ambience that we had been promised were not provided. Onto the parks. We were aware that Space Mountain, Captain EO, and the Carousel were undergoing maintenance. What we did not expect was huge, ugly boarding surrounding those rides and completely ruining the image.  We visited the parks Monday afternoon and evening, Tuesday and Wednesday all day, and most of Thursday. Not once did we see any characters, at all. It seemed the only opportunities to get photos with the characters was to pay for an expensive character meal, which again made us feel like the park was money grabbing. We visited Planet Hollywood on Monday evening, to be sent downstairs to the dingy overflow seating, sat at a booth with peeling furniture taped up, and served plain, expensive burgers. The whole part of the restaurant looked tired and in need of DIY, as did so much of the park. Everywhere we looked were broken parts, peeling furniture, it really felt like the owners just don't care as long as people spend their money. The loos were always grubby and the automatic flushes were faulty, going off whilst sat down, not pleasant! The staff were almost all extremely rude, on one occasion a cleaner ran into me with their wheelie bin, as he was pushing it from behind, and instead of apologising shouted  attention!!  at me. Other staff seemed to flout the rules; we waited 60 minutes as a couple for Ratatouille, to find we shared our ride with a couple who had waited 30 minutes in the  single  rider queue. Other ride disappointments came when we were told it was too windy for the parachute drop and RC Racer ride, only to walk away and see them working literally five minutes later. Other rides such as the train around the Disneyland Park only had one train operating, ridiculous as the wait was then 60 minutes, use another train and you cut that in half. Lastly, despite signs everywhere stating  no smoking , people were smoking everywhere, in queues, in front of children, which is disgusting. I was just so disappointed that my big birthday treat was not what I expected, and that the management of the park has gone so downhill, when it used to be so magical. I spent a lot of money on this holiday, but I wish I had stayed at home, it really was a waste of my hard earned money and I will never visit again.","Neutral"
"There was actually very little there  a few of the Disney classics but not too much else. It was an interesting visit but didn't require a lot of time. Several attractions were closed during my visit.","Neutral"
"I have been to both Disneyland and Disneyworld and knew in advance that this would not be the full on Disney experience, so I managed my expectations.  I took the train from downtown and it was an enjoyable trip. The Disney themed train from Sunny...More","Positive"
"Plan on getting at the gates before they open. It will take longer than you think to get there on busy days. It took about 45min to buy our parking ticket, park, take the team to Downtown Disney, go through the bag check, and finally get our tickets. Then you have to wait to get in the park. When you get in the park go to the bigger rides that are farther away from the gate. The lines are longer at the rides closer to the entrance. We did Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Carribean, and the Haunted Mansio pretty quickly. Then it was. Really packed. Start getting Fastpasses. We would get a Fastpass, then do another ride, then use our Fastpass. It got so packed that you could hardly walk around so we left early. We rode all the big rides though since we got there when they opened. It will be a long day if you get there early afternoon.","Positive"
"Love Disneyland Paris. Visited 25 years ago when I was a young boy and still get the same joy now from seeing my son enjoy it as much as me.Great shows, parades and fireworks. Rides suitable for for all ages. Characters are brilliant. Very clean and tidy. Can   t fault","Positive"
"Having been to Disney World (in Florida) before visiting Disneyland, I expected a LOT more out of this place. It was much smaller than expected, very underwhelming, and really did not feel as  magical  as the Orlando Disney is. If you're going to pay the crazy prices of going to Disney, I'd recommend saving up and traveling over to Orlando for the real thing. If you have some kind of discount, though, it's worth visiting and exploring a bit more around the Anaheim area.","Positive"
"My family has been big fans of Disney for a long time. We have vacationed at Walt Disney World in Orlando many times. However I feel that I cannot truly express my deep disappointment in Disneyland strongly enough. I wish I could give them zero stars. I believe this park is a detriment to the Disney Brand. We visited on December 29, 2014. The experience began with horrendous traffic and an infrastructure that was not built to handle the crowd heading to the park. Inside the park it was dangerously overcrowded. I truly feel that there is a safety issue for families with small children. We were seperated from each other more than a couple of times, as it was impossible to stay together in the extremely overcrowded conditions. Fortunately we did not have small children to keep track of. The lines were also unacceptably long, not only for the rides but to use the restroom as well. The wait times for some rides were over two hours. I am glad I was not there with a young child who would have been looking forward to visiting Disney. The disappointment would have been crushing. It made me very sad to see young families trying to make the best of their visit and trying to console crying children. Until this visit I had always believed Disney was all about giving everyone a truly wonderful experience. I guess I was just drinking the Kool Aid. My opinion of this company is very damaged. To anyone thinking of visiting Disneyland I would most strongly recommend that you look into Walt Disney World in Orlando. They still have the magic. However I would avoid Disneyland in California. There is no magic there, only disappointment.","Negative"
"This was our first trip to Disneyland, and while it is a magical place, we were plagued with ride closures on and off all day long. We were one of the first through the gates in the morning, heading to the Indiana Jones ride first, and it was closed for repairs! It ended up opening up later in the day, but we then had to wait 50 minutes to ride it. Same thing ended up happening with Jungle Cruise and Finding Nemo Submarines. And at the end of the night, my son, who was turning 12 years old at midnight, wanted to ride Big Thunder Mountain at midnight, which he had talked about for months ahead of time. We got to the ride at 11:50pm and it was closed for the night! My son was beyond disappointed and I was disappointed with Disneyland. Overall it was a fun visit, but could have been much better.","Neutral"
"For those who have been to LA or Florida, one day here will be enough. It is a real Disney   clean, friendly staff, regular favourite rides   but be ready to experience the stifling humidity. Try and ensure you have the option of the swim available at then end of the day; also be warned that inclement weather caused the cancellation of the night parade both nights we were there","Neutral"
"Probably spoilt by having visited Disney Orlando a few times, Euro Disney was a major disappointment. Rides not as good, not as tidy, staff rude by comparison and the toilets are such a disgrace. Why are the toilets not maintained by staff, we found them appalling, one was even flooded.First and last time at Euro Disney.","Negative"
"expectations where high as i thought it will be better than euro disney...but by far is Hong Kong DL an smaller and really boring park. We went there on an monday out of season an i can just imagine how people will lay on eachother on an chinese new year or other peak days....my godness never again!!","Negative"
"We recommend the hopper passes if you are mobile enough. We maximized the number of adult rides when we used the Max Pass to book fast passes in the other park when we were entering a ride. This gave us time to go on one ride, book another and walk onto a ride without a pass and then walk over to the other park. We checked the line up times online on the APP to ensure we did not waste time lining up. We used our steps to walk between parks instead. By day 4 we were going on our favourite rides for a second and third time. We also found the restrooms were bigger, nicer and newer in CAP. The fireworks were amazing and worth staying for. They start at 9:30 pm sharp and last 10 minutes. Secure a spot with a view of the castle. We feel the front of the line pass at Universal is superior to the Max Fast Pass at Disney but the superior one is at least 10 times more expensive. We found Wednesday to be the best day to get on rides with short or non existent line ups. The Indiana Jones ride fast pass line is not that great compared to other rides. It still takes awhile to get on the ride. The Mexican restaurant was our favourite place to eat lunch   cafeteria style with plenty of seating.","Positive"
"Every other year my hubby and I make a short trip from Las Vegas to southern CA for a little trip to Mickey's place on the 4th of July. Kind of a tradition we started a while back. Pretty popular place on a holiday, but is so much fun! I hope one of these days, some or all of my grand kids can go with me.  Happiest place on earth  might be a stretch, but even adults can have a whale of a good time if they try.","Positive"
"Based on the recommendations of some reviewers, we planned our trip for October (low season). We bought a  one day one park  ticket, and honestly it's not worth half the money! it was unbelievably crowded we couldn't get into any site without having to wait at least an hour in each line! Plus, we were not aloud to get more than 1 express pass at a time. Very expensive restaurants, and although we were willing to pay that much, we couldn't find a place to sit... Overall, it was a very disappointing experience...","Negative"
"If you've never been to Disney stuff before, this year is the 60 birthday of Disneyland and the parade and fireworks are incredible. I've lived 'in the neighborhood' here for decades, visited many time   although not recently   and must say that the nighttime events are wonderful and not to be missed. It's pretty expensive, but worthwhile for a one time experience.","Positive"
"Spent a week at disney this year with my family, and have to say it was mind blowing not just for the kids but for us the adults as well.the queues were a bit long bit time just flew by.Staff were really friendly and helpful..As a parent of a small child with special needs the whole experience was magical. We were given a special pass for our little boy and he was really looked after.I would highly recommend disneyland paris for any age..Great Holiday cant wait to go back....","Positive"
"Our stay at Center Parcs villages nature Paris which was a lovely place to stay, an advantage being close to Disney, however visited Disney for a day, wish I never went, my children were disappointed too, the queues were horrendous some up to two hours, a lot of attractions were closed for refurb, one ride broke down three times, couldn   t book any fast passes as apparently they have a small amount that can be pre booked, so much for purchasing tickets which include fast pass didn   t book one! After complaining at the city hall, we kindly got offered four Fastpasses of our choice which was a result, but still overall Not a good experience, I   ve visited Disney Paris twice previously in the past, Florida Disney twice cannot compare at all.","Neutral"
"Have been here twicw now and my reviews are overdue!Last visit Nov half term and we had a great time. What is nice about it is that it is manageable, over a couple of days, kind of like a mini Florida!!!!I love Main Street, love the atmosphere.It was quite busy, but not unbearable. Watched the day parades, but didn't manage to get to the night ones on our second visit as we stayed a little out of the Parks at the Explorers Hotel. Daughter was too tired and wanted to swim in the fab Explorers pool anyway.We managed to see quite a few characters and enjoyed our favourite rides.Would love to try Disneyland Paris in Summer as have omly been in the cold, rainy weather!!!","Positive"
"The lines were very long and several rides were breaking down which was very disappointing when you waited 45 minutes in line and you get excited about getting on the ride only to find out that it is broken. This happened on Splash mountain, Thunder Mountain, Haunted House, Screamin and Indiana Jones.","Negative"
"This amusement park is solely focused on taking as many Euros off you as you have. They allow way too many people into the park at one time, meaning that you have to wait around 40   60 minutes just to do a one minute ride. Triple the price for all food and drinks compared to Paris dining. Our children were aged 11 and 14 and the park was clearly targeted at 5   7 year olds. We won't ever be going to a disneyland park ever again even for free as it is a waste of a day. Don't even bother with the Disney Studios next door, the queues were even longer and so much is geared for the patron to buy food or disney products.","Negative"
"They don't have fast or loopy rollercoasters like in Disneyland Paris but still have that great magical atmosphere. Good for kids but not grown ups. The end finale was not as good as DLP Disney dreams but it was still good.The negatives part were mainland chinese people who kept doing their toilet business in every bush you see despite being numerous toilets. What did the toilets do to offend them? Also, having claustrophobia it doesn't help that they do not care for manners or queues, they did not hesitate to push me out of the way IN THE QUEUE. Also, a lady devide to pour water on the floor and my shoes despite being inside a shop. Of course this does not mean all mainlamd Chinese are like these, just from the ones I have encountered. Since you will find big tourist groups coming here.","Positive"
"The prices here are unbelievable. $76 each to get into California Disney. Most of the rides have a 45 minute wait or longer. In 12 hours, we probably went on 7 rides; over $10 a ride. Probably spent over half our visit in a line. Spent about $30 on lunch for a meal that I could have picked up at any fast food joint for a third of the price.$3 for a bottle of water? Really? Not going back.  Happiest place on Earth?  Highly doubtful. Probably got one of the highest profit margins though. Walt Disney had a great idea. I doubt that corporate Dsney has the same vision.","Negative"
"I went there 30 years ago so it was time for the kiddos to go there, they are now 8 and 4 so they did enjoy it, easter vacation is not the optimal time, the lines are very long and there is a flood of people, they should restrict entrance or something, i cant imagine that many people in one place is safe, but what do i know.Other than that we had a great time and enjoy the rides we could get into","Neutral"
"Have just returned from a 3 night break and the whole family had a great time. I had read the reviews before and was wondering if we had made a mistake looking forward to this holiday. We loved the parks, it was clean and the gardens were all well maintained. I can understand why it might not be so magical in August because of the long waits but for us the longest we waited for a ride was 45 mins, on our last day it had really got a lot quieter and waits were down to 15 mins for lots of rides. Fastpass worked well for the really popular rides. Had plenty chance to have photos taken with characters, had to queue (30 mins) for the official photos with Mickey etc We travelled by Eurostar and its so easy, straight out of the station onto shuttle buses and onto the Hotel. We stopped at Cheyenne and enjoyed the wild west theme. The room was fine, big enough for 3 nights and the food was nice too. Lots of choice, even my fussy eater enjoyed his breadkfast and dinner, good dessserts. It was better to eat early for both meals as it did get busy. It cost around 64 euros for a family of 4 and that included a drink each. You can eat at Mcdonalds for just a bit more than UK prices if you dont want to spend too much. Other reviews complained about staff in hotels and parks, but we found if you were polite and friendly so were they. Plan each day what you are going to do, be prepared to queue and watch out for queue jumpers, spread out in lines so no one can get passed you and for a few days forget your British politeness when waiting to go on rides and buses.","Positive"
"Second visit here with an 11 year old and an 8 year old. Stand outs were Big Thunder Mountain and Buzz Lightyears. All rides open and very busy late morning to late afternoon. Nana loved the steam boat ride which the kids found father boring. All in all a great day out. Didn't stay for fireworks because not on until 11pm. A bit too late. ","Positive"
"Not really worth it. So crowded, we cannot move. The lines were full always. Probably they can improve their service.","Neutral"
"I book Disney for   200 for the day for our family of four and there was absolutely no value for money at all. During the day we saw absolutely no Disney characters and felt we could have been in any theme park. The shops and restaurants were stupidly overpriced and the only 'ride' the kids enjoyed was the play area! It's a shame Disney are more concerned about making money than entertaining kids. We won't be going back..","Negative"
"We stayed at the Newport Bay hotel. Lovely hotel 7 mins walk around the lake to the park. Disney was fantastic. Plaza Gardens on NYE was amazing in all areas. Service, food and atmosphere.","Positive"
"I have been to other Disney parks (Orlando, Paris) and I found this one the least attactive. I know it is the original park, but they could add more attractions to it, or at least maintain all the rides open... Four attractions were closed!!!! That too many for a park so small. My daughter was very disappointed that she couldn  t go to the Splash mountain... The castle is not tall, it  s the shortest castle we have ever seen. The good points of the park is that it  s clean, organized, offers a nice variety of restaurants and stores. Downtown Disney was really nice! I would recommend Orlando rather than California when it comes to Disney.","Neutral"
"Crowed but that was expected. I still don't know why people don't use the fast pass system but if you want to ride on any of the major attractions, get a fast pass. We stood in one line for space mountain after it was posted the estimate was 75 min but it really took 120 min. Hard to abandon the line after investing so much time already. We watched the fireworks in New Orleans Square in by the water and it was fantastic as there was a water show as well as the fireworks. We walked up as the fireworks started and had front row viewing.","Positive"
"Disney doesn't do anything half way.  The staff is well trained and the rides are awesome.  The price is the only thing that makes you re consider going back.  The park was packed so people are willing to pay.","Positive"
"We visited on 26th April and paid 67 euros per adult (x4) and 64 euros for our 4 year old. We got there at 12 (it opens at 10am) and found it to be quiet in the ticket queue. Once inside the park however, it became obvious that a lot of the rides for younger families  such as Robinson Crusoes tree house and the pirate boat were closed. In total 14 attractions were closed. Most of them aimed at the younger audiences. Of the children's rides that were open, there were at least 20 minute queues for Dumbo, Carousel, teacups and mad hatters tea party. We did t even bother queuing for the character meets as the wait was 30 minutes and the encounters were too brief for it to be worth it. We stopped for a bite to eat in the diner. Food was VERY expensive and cold. Not worth the money. We ended up riding the  it's a small world  boat twice and then it was time for the parade. The parade was the best part of the entire day. I think that we should be warned about the ride closures prior to purchasing tickets and the tickets should be reduced if lots of attractions are to be closed. Overpriced and not good value for money when attractions are closed.","Negative"
"We paid 55 euros each to spend one day in the main eurodisney park had we not saved 20% with our visit Paris tickets then it would have been 69 euros each inc children over 12! We found that some things were not operating or were broken The queues were huge and you can only have one fast pass ticket out at a time so u cant plan ur day out in advance take note Disney! The food was overpriced crap so take your own. Overall this being our 3rd Disney trip i think we are all Minnie moused out!!!","Neutral"
"No matter what day you go the park it will always be crowded. Always crowded with annual pass holders or locals. Handicap rules are unrealistic for people with true disabilities. Ticket prices are so expensive and when you arrive lines are tooo long or rides are closed. They do not have a handle on crowd control. They allow to many people in the park that you can't enjoy the park. Better cheaper parks in neighboring area, but because its Disney you want to enjoy the new shows but you can't way out of control with the crowds and honestly dangerous.","Negative"
"We absolutely love the Disneyland Park!  Great shops, great rides, great parades, great shows and fantastic staff   Disney at its absolute best.  Stepping into this park, is like stepping into a magical world and you're part of it.  Fantastic 5*","Positive"
"I love everything about Disneyland.  We have been many times and are excited for the  many more times we are planning!","Positive"
"$4.75 for a bottle of water? Really? Admission is a fortune already. Also, wish there was more shade for a lot of the lines, it was 85  during our visit. On a positive note, love the FastPass system!","Neutral"
"I have been to the Disneyland in California 3 times, and the overall experiences were good. When I visited the one in HK about 2 3 years ago, I thought it was too crowd, but for the people who live around this area, it still worths...More","Neutral"
"Took my family for a midweek trip. The park is clean and well organised. As it was midweek, it was quiet and we were able to get on all of the rides with limited queueing. There are new rides in the Studios park which are OK.Well worth a visit if you can go off peak","Positive"
"Been there over April half term. Group of 7 with kids youngsters 5,12,15 and only the youngest was really happy. 2 biggest attractions  Hook's ship and Indiana Johns were closed  without website info, Mine rollercoster  70min in lane, to see princess  20 30 min to  book appointment  then 2nd lane to see her  nightmare. For this price better to add few pounds and get Merlin Pass for a year and drive all around UK. Very over rated, far from you can see on TV commercials, all restaurants and shops far to expensive, it's like huge,nice and very commercial village not real family attraction.","Neutral"
"We are a Disney Family and our son currently works at Disney World. We planned two days at the park as that is the normal time it takes to enjoy everything at both Disneyland and Disney World. We went to the park on a Tuesday and Thursday while in Hong Kong. Here is the bad parts:Park was very small, easily navigated it in a half day. Not as many rides as either US parks. US narrative on the jungle cruise was free lance and no script. Should have done the Chinese line. Now for the good:Mystic Manor was very well done.Jungle Cruise offered in 3 languages (not sure they knew the script in English)Toy Story land was very cute. Small World had a few items like Disney characters in each themed area. Grizzly Gulch was fun. Mine Train had a great unexpected twist to the ride. Best Space Mountain of the three Disney parks we have.visited. Firworks were AWESOME. EASY access to the park using the MTR and Disneyland Express.","Neutral"
"The park itself is very well kept and a great place for the kids, but as a parent having to wait 50 minutes in line for nearly all rides and then getting a ride under a minute is completely unacceptable. The kids were so disappointed. Disney is far too greedy with this and I would probably not visit again because of this. What a shame.","Negative"
"What a business idea! Let People pay hundreds of Euros to stand in line... even if you spend a whole day in the park you wont be able to go on all the rides, because of the ridiculusly long lines! ...and the rides aren't that many! Man attractions were closed due to maintenance.. Therese were long lines to all the food stands tio, because they didn't have enough personell. Everything lacked efficiency...","Negative"
"I have an annual pass so I've been a lot recently. My feb visit was the best so far because it was an off week. I just have to address the overcrowding issue. It's almost miserable because it's so crowded. Do they not have a crowd cap ... I wish they did!!!!! One day I went and rode 2 rides and was just done getting run over by strollers and bumped into by random people and waiting in hour long lines... So I packed up my kid and went home!!!:( Other than that  the cleanliness always makes me happy and the rides never disappoint (if you actually get on one). Food is always outstanding as well as the customer service of the cast members !!! Something for everyone here!!!:)","Neutral"
"We went to disney for 4 nights and stayed at sequoia lodge, which was fine, clean and easy check in. The food was very tasty although a little over priced as everything is in disney.Overall we did have a good week and our two kids had fun although it has lost its sparkle, it would appear money needs to be spent on the two parks with multiple rides breaking down more than once in one day! Crushs coaster was often broken and when it was open it had queues of upto 100 mins with no option to fast track either.Stars in their cars parade was very disappointing with only 6 cars!! The stunt show, although very good however they had cut back on numerous stunts, jet ski stunt etc. The Tram ride was sending out trams half full as carriages appeared closed or broken?!Flying carpets were completely shut for refurb however nobody was working on them!The buzz light year ride was shut on a few occasions with technical problems as was space mountain!Thunder mountain had a queue of 75 mins most of the time however if you wanted to fast track your pass it took 30 mins to get your ticket then another 20 min to get on the ride, surely this defeats the point of fast track?The Michael Jackson show was completely closed for refurb, again nobody working on it.There were no characters around the parks, only visible on the very short parades so don't waist money buying an autograph book!The Wild West show was was enjoyable and a must see.In general it was very disappointing and I certainly wouldn't waist my money going there again I would rather pay more for the Florida parks!","Negative"
"As a family we had had a couple of pretty taxing Christmases so we decided to go away together for the first time during the festive season! We were prepared for the cold, we were prepared for the wet but what we weren't prepared for was the general attitude of the staff. Morale seemed very low and it showed. A few people were incredibly helpful, but most of the staff seemed disinterested and not particularly engaged with their roles. The cleaning staff actually went on strike on the second day we were there, decorating the courtyard with toilet paper and banging on wheelie bins. They felt underpaid and unappreciated. The park Itself was super busy, with queues everywhere; rides, restaurants, shops and toilets. Everything took a long time. We opted to go full board which was a mistake. The food was appalling; overpriced, badly presented by an obviously overwhelmed kitchen staff. As a coeliac, I was constantly presented with a choice of two microwave ready meals, beef with olives or meatballs and rice at both lunch and dinner. I did try the meatballs, which was served rather charmingly in its microwavable tray with the film still on. I didn't try it again. I was advised not to eat anything else. although Annette's Diner did prepare me a meal they said was gluten free. My tummy was uncertain afterwards but that could be because of the fact I had eaten the chocolate chip cookies I was given for breakfast(!) for lunch as I couldn't eat anything else in the park. My husband and four children were sick to death of burgers by day 2. The fast pass machine broke on two occasions and two of the more popular rides developed  faults  and closed. It wasn't good. However given that my two teenage children (19 and 17) couldn't get a mobile phone signal we actually talked properly and were able to laugh about the situation we were in. The magic of Disney did help. and my younger children (10 and 7) very much enjoyed the atmosphere and shows. However having been to Disneyland Florida, Paris is very much the poor relation. Going to be writing to see if I can get the extra money I paid for full board refunded. I think that Disney need to realise that coeliacs cannot live on cookies and cake alone.....","Neutral"
"Not like the Disneyland in Tokyo, which is also good for young people, I would think the HK one is much smaller and for children only.","Neutral"
"Visited May 16, 2015 and found the over all professionalism at this park much different from Disney World. Many cast members were seen chatting with one another and not greeting guests or helpful. Restaurant lost our reservation. Park at night is extremely dark. I have regularly gone to Disney World since it opened in 1971 and all of us in this group have even been to Disney Paris. All 5 of us noticed the level of service and professionalism at this park was lacking. ( ages 55  23 ) Won't go again. For $155 for a one day Park hopper you should expect Disney service. It was not the happiest place on earth. There was nothing special about this visit. The park seemed more like a Six Flags property rather than a Disney property.","Neutral"
"Except for a few moments, or to be more accurate seconds   in which you at last spend time at one of the attraction, We and the kids mostly suffered. The queues were long wherever you wanted to go, and you have to suffer rain or too much sun during your wait. Even at the restaurant we had to fight to find a table, just to discover our expensive lunch would probably be overlooked even by stray cats.The place is managed in a very cynical manner, they charge you 9 Euros for a lousy kids stroller, and after waiting for an hour each time just to spend a minute and 20 seconds on flying Dumbo or Buzz Lightyear we broke and travelled back to paris around 6 PM. Our impression was that the management doesn't bother to do anything about this deliberately, as they prefer their fraud victims to return the next day to spend again many hours in the endless queus.The  Fast pass  system also sucks   who is going to wait for his queue for  Peter Pan  at 8:50 PM if he gets the card at 3 PM, and can't get any other  fast pass  until then ?Do not go there, at least not in August and school vacations.","Negative"
"Of course it was my first time and my 5 year old child's first time. We had to queue all the time. For the whole day, we only experienced three or four attractions. Quite a lot of people did not obey order. The staffs was very reluctant to recover the order. Price at the food court was quite high. We queued for princess experience just to take one photo of my daughter with a costume playing actress.","Neutral"
"We love WDW Florida and have always really wanted to visit the original park. It is wonderful. Much smaller than WDW and easily do able in one day but it was lovely as a Disney fan to see some of the original rides and pieces of history. There isn't as much here for a thrill ride junkie as WDW and some of the coasters are quite dated and shoogly but the atmosphere is pure Disney magic. I would recommend paying extra for the max pass fast pass, it saved us a lot of running around. Dress comfortable and come armed with a game plan if you want to have an enjoyable day. I would recommend bringing in a packed lunch as the restaurants in the park are often expensive, crowded and not great food.","Positive"
"Visited the park for one day as part of a longer holiday in France. First went when it first opened in 92 & our last time was around 6 yrs ago. Really looked forward to taking our 4yr old for his first time. The day started well with Ratatouille ride but after a boring ride on studio tours (which needs updating) there was nothing left in studios to entertain a 4yr old without queueing for at least 45 50mins so we moved on to the main park.The park is still immaculate (though some of the toilets left plenty to be desired   yuck) but it's lost it's magic and sparkle. There were no characters spotted out and about, though we did spot a princess moving through the park heavily cloaked and escorted least anyone stop to ask her for a photo. Loads of rides were either closed or had really long queues and looked   felt tired and shabby. Staff were just employees, not Disney ambassadors   we experienced a few curt and rude exchanges in shops and restaurants despite conversing in French. The whole thing felt like an enterprise in packing people in and making money, which although it was always thus, you never felt like did before. It's so sad to see the neglect in entertaining people and making it magic for them. I was still entranced 6yrs ago, this time I was weary and fed up, we didn   t even stay for final parade which we   ve always stopped for. It needs an overhaul and some new rides creating based on later films plus the free roaming characters bringing back   they add to the magic people expect.","Neutral"
"If you are a adult and you like of emotion, maybe this is not the perfect place.You can have a bit emotion, but not enough. However, if you don't have the habit to do something with lots emotion or if you are young, probably you will enjoy this park.","Neutral"
"We saved Disneyland till the end of our time in the US as a treat for the kids. Never did we expect to be caught up in the magic. Bring snacks to save a bit of money, wear your sneakers and do a bit of research before you come. So many people did not understand or take advantage of the fast pass system. It is FREE. You can hold one per park at a time and I can't think of a reason why anyone would line up for a fast pass ride without a fast pass. It takes a bit of planning but utilising fast pass and the park hopper pass, we rode every ride and saw every show over our five days including many double ups on our favourites including California screamin, Buzz and the incredibly impressive soarin over the world. Seriously, everyone applauded each time.","Positive"
"Absolutely disgusted with service. Called to book holiday for next year today and cannot believe what we have been told. We explained we wanted to stay in the Davy Crockett Ranches and would be bringing a folding camper. We were told we could park this on a car park. Called back later to confirm details who then told us it would cost   16 per night to park which was fair enough. Called back later to book and we were then told they couldn't accommodate the camper and that in the whole time Disney had been open they had NEVER had this request before. This absolutely cannot be true. We don't want to camp we want to stay in the Disney accommodation then continue our holiday afterwards. How can this have never been requested before??? we want to book before October 15th to benefit from latest offer. UTTER RUBBISH!!!!","Negative"
"I'm probably going to get shot down here, but I found the original Disneyland Resort to be dated, and worn out, with many of the rides in exactly the same condition that they were during my last visit in the 90's. the rides all utlise old technology, and the Animatronics are so 70's! The downtown Disney area was an interesting side attraction, with plenty of shopping opportunities. While it still offers a fun day out, it is probably better suited to people who enjoy the older style attractions, and reminiscing about old times.","Negative"
"We love theme parks and have visited several theme parks around the world. Unfortunately this is the worst we've been so far. This was our second visit to Disneyland in Hong Kong. The park was overcrowded with long queus. Due to the guests from mainland China there was a lot of queue jumping which resulted in a lot of fighting and pushing. The staff of the park did nothing to control these people. We stayed for four days but after day two my children did not want to go to the park anymore due to these rude, unbehaved guests from the mainland. Toilets are disgusting with human feces on the floors   again due to these uncivilized guests. The staff are rude and not all of them can speak English. They shout and scream at everyone. It was hot and all queues are in the sun. So be prepared to stand for hours in the sun in a queue with people pushing and breathing on you. I cannot recommend this park to anyone with small children. During the parades adults are pushing you. On more than one occasion I almost dropped my child due this. I visited this park about seven years ago and it was totally different. It definitely worsened over the years. If you are looking for a fun filled family vacation at a theme park, please AVOID this one at all cost. Rather go to the more civilized Disneyland in Tokyo.","Negative"
"What a waste of time and money. And to think I was planning on bringing by teenage kids. I went with a mate of mine who happened to be here at the same time. If you are over 8 years old, then there is nothing for you here. There is one roller coaster, Space mountain, that can only be described as LAME!!(my kids favourite word) with banked turns there are no G forces at all. And that my friends is it. Nothing else at all. No other rides that suit anyone over 8. The Dumbo ride is the next most thrilling ride and caters for anyone over the age of 2. Food is terrible. I just didn't eat in the end and I live in Asia so it isn't like I don't eat Asian food. The park is too small, the rides are hopeless, the food is awful, we didn't hang around for the fire works at we would have had to wait another five hours and we were sick of it by then.If you decide you have to go, a morning or afternoon will be enough. I am so pleased I didn't bring my 2 teenage boys from Singapore to HK and waste 2k on planes and hotels. they would not have been happy.One positive note, the park was nearly empty so very short queues. Not a surprise in hindsight.","Negative"
"We found a Buy 3 get 1 Free ticket promotion online and the prices were the cheapest except that we needed to visit before January 3, 2016. We couldn't make it any other dates except on January 1, 2016 and that day happened to be a busy day for HK Disneyland. We bought a Disneyland PhotoPass package which we thought it was a good deal since we are splitting the cost. But we later realized that we had spent too much time waiting in line to take pictures with the Disneyland characters and that we did not enjoy as many rides as we would like. The park itself is small but we did not have time to walk through the entire park. The fire work show at night was great. Make sure you start saving your spot for this fire work show. The mid day parade was good too. Recommend going early in the day and start enjoying the park.","Neutral"
"Disneyland should be  Welcoming ,  HAPPY ,  CHEERFUL , etc...  well, unfortunately not for Paris!!  The staff where rude and hardly speak the international language   ENGLISH!!  Rides were awesome but as usual long queues..","Negative"
"good: yes, this is genuine Disney, so nice etc.bad: super looong queues, some shabby equipment yes, we, of course, had high expectations, given that this is the famous Disney park, and, indeed, it's big, nice and everything. but the overall impression was significantly spoiled by the long queues (and ultra long queues to the most popular and interesting attractions, where the ETA was exceeding 1 hour   crazy!!). also some attractions were not operational, and some had visible signs of wear and shabbiness. and, yeah, it's pretty expensive.","Neutral"

"Disneyland is much smaller and more compact than its Orlando counterpart, which makes it much easier to get around and enjoy the amenities. We loved the rides, especially It's a Small World, Pirates of the Caribbean and Splash Mountain. Adventure Park was great for the younger kids, and lines for rides were much shorter than anticipated. Food is plentiful and reasonably priced. Bring a stroller if you don't want to pay $15 a day for rentals, and check the Disney site on the internet for ticket specials.","Positive"
"A tad disappointing after Paris Disney as it is small and has only a few fun rides. Most disappointing was the lack of variety in the retail therapy!!!! Sorry Disney but I   d go to Ocean Park next time.","Neutral"
"My wife and I just came from Disneyland earlier and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. I've been fortunate enough to visit all the Disneylands so my review is relative to the other parks. If I have to compare I would rate the Paris disneyland on the bottom part. It's still disneyland with most of the funfare which only a disney park can bring but in terms of service it was well below par. There were a lot of attractions that were close. Also, almost half of the food stall on the park seemed close and on the main food court there was a long queue on the line since there was only cashier open to accommodate all the guests. They could have at least added an additional staff there. I'm not sure if it's because it was a weekday or if because there was a slight snow during the morning but it still doesn't excuse the other food stalls to be close (I would understand some of the attractions closed if there are snows or rains). If this is a normal practice by the management on weekdays or low volume days then they should at least cut some of the rate their charging. Btw, I've been to other disney parks on weekdays and never had this experience. The other two things that really disappointed me is that they seem to allow or are very lax on smoking in the park. I actually saw a lot of people and even mothers smoking in the park (while on queue, walking on the park, etc). You would expect the Park management would be strict about this given it's a children's park for crying out loud. The other major disappointment is that it felt to me in general (not all though) the staffs didn't show that usual hospitability and approachability that all disney staffs are known for. I asked a staff for some direction and didn't even bother to look at me much more smile. I felt that he's not really in to his work. Even some of the staffs who help on managing the people during the parades were not smiling. I never had these type of encounters from the staffs on other disney parks.If you haven't been to a disney park this should be ok but if you've been to one, you might get disappointed","Negative"
"We visited Disneyland during the 50th Anniversary Celebration and for me it was very disappointing. We visited on February 20 22. We purchased the 3 day parker hoppers so we could visit Disneyland and California Adventure. This was the first visit for my girls who at 7 and 4 were very excited about visiting Disney. We took out 7 year old out of school for a few days and thought February would be a good time to visit and we might just avoid the huge crowds that converge on Disney during the summer months. Well, we were wrong. It seems that there isn't a really good time to visit and avoid the huge crowds. Our first day was a Monday and it was a holiday so we expected them to be crowded since school was out. The following Tuesday and Wednesday were not any better. Seems a lot of other people had the same idea. The only times we were able to ride any of the rides were first thing in the morning. By noon it was impossible to get on any ride without having to wait well over 45 minutes to an hour. Certain rides did have the Fast Pass which did work well but that is only used for certain rides and even then is not always used. There is a line for everything at Disneyland and California Adventure. You wait in a line to have your bags checked before you even enter the park. On the third day the line was really long. Once you enter the park you have to wait in a line to show them your ticket. Once inside the park the lines really start. You wait in a large, crowded group line at Main Street for the actual rides to open. Then when they open there is a mad dash my grown ups with small children and strollers to get to the rides. If your not careful you could be run over. On our visit we knew at least 2 rides would be closed. On the first day we got in line for the Matterhorn only for them to close it as we were walking up because of some problem. We finally got to ride it on the 3rd day but heard later that same day that it was closed again. Spash Mountain was not running the first 2 days, finally at the end of our 3rd day we saw it was running. We eventually were able to ride some of the rides that we wanted to ride. It is just very frustrating and almost like work instead of fun to go on the rides. Even trying to ride the kiddy rides was difficult. We waited for at least 30 40 minutes to ride the tea cups, which my little girls enjoyed very much. I just wondered if the 4 grown men in line ahead of us enjoyed it too. Grown ups waiting in lines for rides that are for small children, I just did not understand. The worst part was probably the very rude people. People who would crowd in front of you so they could get a better view of a parade or a character. They would push their kids right in front of other kids who had been standing in a line to see one of the characters. We stood in a line for about 25 30 minutes for my girls to get a picture and autograph from Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. They did get there picture and autograph but I had to point out to this one man where the line started. Had I not done that my girls would have missed out since the princesses had to leave after seeing my girls. People started lining up along the street at 6:00 for the parade that started at 7:15. We sat a table near Main Street about 30 45 mins and started out with a pretty good view of where the parade would pass by. Just as the parade was getting ready to start, people tried to crowd us out of where we had been sitting. Trying to push their children in front of us, pulling the chairs away from where we had been sitting and even standing on the table. And then these same people were overheard complaining because their children could not see the parade. There were way to many people, the food was overpriced, the Cast Members were not very friendly and we hardly ever saw any of them smile. From my memory of visiting when I was a child it sure seemed to be a lot nicer place to visit. For the price that we paid we came away very disappointed it what we got for our money. It seems the only thing that is important at Disneyland is money. It seems that no one cares about it anymore. Trash in the water, bathrooms smelled and paper and trash in the streets. I'm glad that my girls got to visit Disneyland but it will be a long while before we ever return again. It was just not a very good experience for us. Think twice about spending your money on Disney.","Negative"
"Disney need to wake up and get a conscious not subject kids to mental cruelty. Queued for 2 hours 30mins with a 7 year old and a 3 year old who I had to try to keep entertained and calm. Most kids need the toilet, refreshment or a little Disney magic during such a long period and despite waiting I'm sad to say the Rapunzel character remained out of reach. I finally had to give in to the kids and take them out of the queue when it got to 2hours 45mins!It's a very simple thing to put a human in a costume. I know the cash registers must keep ringing and thousands are in the park but there is a simple solution. Disney fat cats can save the blood, sweat and tears before bedtime and get more than one Mickey Mouse in the park to greet the thousands.Hell get 12 of them milling round the park and maybe 15 Minnies and 30 Elsas while you're at it.And for god sake why would you wait till 11pm at night to throw a firework's display and close a children's park!?! Do you really want to encourage all those crowds to waiting for a late night spectacle which will result in everyone leaving at the same time?Why do you insist on collecting for yourself a pile of broken dreams, shattered souls and poor reviews? Sort it out and grow a heart. I challenge you to solve this EuroDisaster!","Negative"
"I loved, loved, loved Disneyland Paris! I've been to the Orlando Parks many times, and I think what I like best about this park is that it is incredibly manageable. We visited just for the day, and ran from ride to ride. The park wasn't too busy, so our longest wait was only about 35 minutes. Several rides were closed (some we knew about, others seemed to be last minute maintenance problems) but, being there only for a day, we we had more than enough to fill up the day. For those used to the Orlando Parks, it will be strange to see people smoking everywhere, and even puffing on their e cigs while standing in line. There also seems to be big difference in line etiquette    people pushed in front of us many times, and it seemed like letting your kids climb all over the railings is considered ok. Then again, maybe I am just getting old and cranky. I don't think I'd suggest a special trip to Europe just for Disneyland Paris, but if any Disney fan happens to be in the neighborhood, it's a great treat.","Positive"
"This attraction could have a 1 star rating on TA and still day after day, year after year, people will Q up to go and see Disney land. Such is the power of the brand. Reality is, all reviews are pretty pointless but here goes anyhow...We went with 2 kids, 5 and 7. They liked it but then this morning I went to the playground and we went crazy on some of the toys there and I think they had a better time there! The kids did love the parade and they loved the pirates and the thunder mountain. But I am simply not convinced that kids really love it. Looking around the park, watching tired parents queu up with cranky kids, made me think: why are we all here? Because we think we need to take our kids there. It has become a must. But is it really? Seeing parent after parent with bags and bags full of Disney toys and princess dresses etc etc. what a business...This was our worst experience: My little girl loves the princesses. We queued for 1 hour 20 minutes in a hot place. Finally it was our turn. We were allowed to see 1 princess, Snow White , then we were quickly ushered out. Horrible. Big disappointment. I would not go again, that is for sure.","Neutral"
"Just returned from 5 nights at Hotel New York with children and grandchildren. 'Once in a lifetime' was the plan and once was definitely enough! Stayed in New York Hotel and planned to enjoy the 'Extra Magic Hours' which Disney sell as a great benefit of staying in one of their hotels: 'Make the most of the magic'' 'Exclusive access' etc, etc in their literature and was one of the reasons I booked for seven family members at great cost. MAGIC HOURS ARE A CON   only one of the parks was open (Walt Disney Studio Park opened at 10am not 8am) and in the Disneyland Park not a single one of the bigger rides was open. Four of the five adults in our group went early to do the big rides that the children were too small for and it was not possible to do a single one of them   with one park shut till it opened for all the public and the big rides in the other not open we could not ride on Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, Big Thunder Mountain, rock and Roller coaster, Tower of Terror etc in the so called 'Magic Hours' All that was open was some things in fantasy land and discovery land. As a result, the only things available from 8  10 had long queues  ( those for characters as long as at any other time of day). When I went to very politely complain I was dismissed and told I couldn't without my hotel ticket which another family member who had already headed back to the hotel had with them. This was before the park was open to none hotel guests so it was clear I was a guest in the hotel. Don't let this selling of magic hours make you spend money to stay in a Disney hotel unless you already planned to. In addition the queues for many rides are massive, two hours for some and the queues for the incredibly expensive fast food are huge and the service at fast food sites is excruciating slow and inefficient. There are many great things about Disney   I have been to Florida Parks with my own children and this was my first visit to the Paris parks but the French site needs to learn from the USA one how to make fast food fast. The food in buffet and waited table restaurants is much higher quality than I expected and the staff are almost all friendly but some improvements would make a big difference. PUT MORE STAFF ON FAST FOOD TILLS!!! Plus, we hired a buggy for fifteen euros but you cannot return it at the hotel so the time when we needed it the most   the last part of a long day we had to hand it in with a fifteen minute walk to the hotel carrying a very tired four year old. It would be simple to allow guests to hire from outside the park and return there or at any of the hotels by having guests show their hotel ticket pass at the gate exits. SORT THIS OUT!!! The grandchildren loved the holiday, the characters, the shows, the rides, castle and the parades but I assume Disney don't want guests to go on the big rides between 8 and 10am and then leave the park and therefore don't open them so the 'Magic Hours' claim is a myth. I saw many disappointed guests that morning but my not being allowed to complain there and then just added to the feeling of frustration that morning. I hope this helps others planning a trip","Neutral"

"Maybe going to Disneyworld Florida made it harder to enjoy this park because that trip was so magical...but it just wasn't anywhere near in the same league.The staff were rude and unhelpful, we were in the queue for a ride and actually saw a staff member barge past someone infront...in Florida it's like they're on stage and never stop acting to keep the magic alive.The queue times were ridiculous, we got on 4 rides in 12 hours and 1 of those was a fast pass. We queued 1hr10 for Peter Pan for it to break down when we were 10 mins to the front, about 45 mins later they then told everyone they were closing it for maintenance. No fastpasses were given out, we just got shooed off.The castle illuminations were great and the only one magical thing about the day.","Negative"
"Big queues and absolutely ridiculous prices for food and drink. Seriously, If you think food drink prices are bad in UK theme parks     be prepared for a shock.Whole areas closed.

"I have been going to Disneyland for years since I was very young. I am very sad to say that the magic has been lost. Starting with the fact I gave this company $150.00 for absolutely nothing!I have a friend who works at Disneyland and can get discounted tickets to other theme parks, Disney provides this service to their employees. My friend purchased our Disney tickets and another park. Well her partner accidentally left our tickets in our Las Vegas hotel room when we left for California. So my friend called her employers (Disney) to see what could be done to get us new tickets. She had the receipt, but all they told her was,  Sorry, don't know what to tell you , and  we cannot replace those tickets because if the original tickets are found and used, we will be out money , I am surprised Disney could ever be  out money . So this is how loyal Disney fans are treated. I am really disappointed because I had already spent so much in the park. I took my boyfriend to the very expensive Blue Bayou restaurant and we spent quite a bit in the World of Disney shop. Really sad they couldn't do anything to help us and we (the patrons) have to eat the loss. Sad Disney is so overrated! Not worth the ticket prices, if I hadn't gotten the discounted tickets to Disneyland I wouldn't have paid to get in full price and parking as well. You pay a lot of money to get on 10 rides at the most. Some of the lines were 2 hours long. Dodging baby strollers all day. So not worth it. For how much we paid I could have gotten into Knott's Berry Farm, Seaworld, and Universal Studios and still had shopping money! We will be skipping the Disney hype next time. It's true what they say,  Disneyland, a people trap set by a mouse.","Negative"

"What   s so amazing about this place? OK, at the first glance, it gave us high expectations with the castle spires sticking up in the sky. But as getting closer, it was nothing but a theme park with boring constructions of what been picked out from the cartoon pictures. Too many people, too expensive (45     person), too boring and nothing impressed either me or the children. Queues on the high way to the park, queues to get a parking place, queues to buy the expensive entrance tickets, queues to be seated by a lunch table, 20 minutes only to be attended by the waiters, another 30 minutes to get what been ordered, queues to race attraction. The shortest time was 40 minutes to the attraction for the smallest children, the most popular attraction (Indiana Jones roller coaster) had a 120 minutes queue time! Is it too arrogant to expect the staff to at least know how to calculate when working as cash personnel? I know that we are in France and not to expect people to be able to speak English even though the Disney thing is an American concept. But do at least hire someone who can calculate what to give back on a 20 Euro bill when the customer is to pay 12 Euro   ? Or do I expect too much?Our children 9 and 11 years old hated the place and couldn   t see anything exciting about it. Relieving for us. We rather spend time in Liseberg in Gothenburg or Grona Lund in Stockholm next time, far more worth the money, time and much more amusement for our kids   and our selves. Sometimes it takes a disappointed experience like this to see that the grass is not greener on the other side   .Going back there, most likely not.","Negative"

"I visited with my partner, my daughter and two grandchildren. We spent three days here, and although theme parks aren't my 'thing', the Christmasy feel was unbelievable. My grandson was enthralled by it all, and it was wonderful to see his face.However, I had no idea that I should have remortgaged! I know it was Disneyland, but it really is ONLY Disneyland   the shops sell only Disney related products, be they    26 pyjamas,    16 mugs, right down to bags of Haribo sweets......... yep, with the Disneyland logo on them.Food   no wonder I saw people making picnic rolls at breakfast in the hotel and stuffing them into their bags   lunch came to a minimum of    30 a day, and our evening meals (a very basic main course and one drink x three) totalled    90      100 euros a day.All I will say is, enjoy it, but beware that you will need to take plenty of spending money, even though all the rides etc are free.","Neutral"
"Though the reviews says that its worth to go for two days package, its good for 1 day. Most of the days, Disneyland opens from 10.30 am and until 11 pm. More details can be found in the disneyland website. we get the information for next one week. So, you can plan almost last moment on how do you want to go to this land.. Its a total fun for Kids, who are crazy on Mickey & Mini.. But what HK has done is to introduce Toy Story Land and Tomorrow Land, which is bit different. There will be Mickey and Mini in the entrance itself (10.30 am) for the meet & greet session. We were stuck at this place, since my son wanted to have photo and then only move to next site land. In reality, there are meet & greet sessions inside the park for Micky,minnie, goofy, pluto, princess, daisy also. Overall the experience was very good for family.","Positive"
"As a family of 4, Disneyland was an affordable vacation. Shocking to say, because it's Disney, but it's true. When you go to Disneyland you have to be patient because there are those who are rude with no manners that race through the park and do not care if they step on you or mow you down with their strollers because they are in too much of a hurry. The cast members are always helpful and super nice. The park was always clean. If someone spilled dry cereal on the ground there was a cast member right along to clean it up. The restrooms were clean and well stocked. The cashiers in the shops had long lines but turned people out quickly. My family cannot wait to go again.","Positive"

California vs Florida, Florida is a lot bigger but I liked this one also. Castles do not compare, Florida's is twice the size. One thing I wanted to do is ride the bobsleds and they were closed the 3 days we were there. Bummer. I will definitely be back.","Positive"

"For what you actually get it's a waste of money. I was curious to see what it was like on my first trip to Hong Kong. The atmosphere is what you'd expect from a Disney park, and it's nice to walk around but in terms of actual attractions it is a bit thin on the ground. By far the worst of the three parks I've been to.","Negative"
"Travelled with my husband and two year old son, loved the park although rather busy on the Saturday, would recommend a weekday visit for guests where possible as a lot quicker to get on rides and meet characters.Many attractions and rides that our two year old could go on so we had a fantastic time seeing the smile on his face.The parade was also excellent.Hope to visit again next year.","Positive"
"It was nice to take our boys and walk down memory lane with them. The weather was perfect! We chose to go in Feb as it is a slower time to be at the park. We can't imagine going in the heat of summer and standing in 2 hr line ups?!? It's worth it to take the kids out of school and go in the slower cooler season. It felt quite busy and there were definitely line ups and fast passes to be used!!! It's expensive that's for sure and as far as we are concerned the best place to eat is the Chinese food place at California adventure. Oh ...grab a double margarita directly across from there! The cars radiator springs is a terrific ride and a must. All in all it was a fun trip to take. Would we go again? Hmm...Maybe... When our boys have kids of their own! I think we will save our money and take the them else where for a lot less money and virtually line up free in comparison!!! Ps: wear good walking shoes... Your tired achy feet will thank you!!! Pps: when you want to stop to pull something out of your stroller or bag... Step to the side please! And if you want to take a leisurely stroll... Not sure if Disney is the place to do that? People move at a good clip and are often racing around trying to make their fast pass time... Last thing they need is the person in front of them making an abrupt stop! Or Mr. Slow poke taking his sweet time... It's Disney people... MOVE ... ","Neutral"
"Great place to visit for a first timer to disneyland, but i think every other tourist had the same idea. WE WERE ALL THERE. Crowd was huge and we barely got on a few rides. Disneyland is a great place to visit but i would recommend downtown disney more if your going to visit during christmas","Neutral"
"Took the grandkids for Easter Break. Had been there 3.5 years ago and really noticed a deterioration in maintenance this time. The park was very busy, fine, but several rides were broken down on both days and the state of some of the toilets was disgusting, certainly not what I expect of a Disney Park, and we have been to several. These were not isolated incidents but several in different tort blocks. Leaking toilets, no toilet paper and a couple of them were very smelly. We had two girls with us and thought the prices in the shops were extortionate. You know Disney prices are high but some things, especially 20th anniversary items were way over the top it makes it hard for kids to be able to afford to bring back gifts. The light show at night was fantastic and we had a great time but it does worry me that standards are not being kept up","Neutral"

"First big (read: expensive with air, hotel, transportation) trip with the family (wife, kids  11, 9, 4 , and me). We chose Disneyland in December when we could have gone anywhere $10K can take you for 8 days. The last time my wife and I were there was in '95. No DCA at that time   just the main attraction. And I don't remember ever having to wait in an August line for more than 45 minutes for any attraction.There is ample evidence that there are more theme parks in the SoCal area. Disney talent is EXTREMELY uneven and inconsistent. We had one fabulous cast member who answered our questions the way we remember Disney doing it in '95   enthusiastic, cheerful, knowledgeable, authentic, etc. To some who either didn't know where some attractions were and didn't know who to send us to.What's clear is that the park is WAYYYYYYYY beyond capacity, and in December. Safety has to be a major concern. I have some familiarity with disaster planning and if the masses ever got out of control in that park, it would be chaos. It took us three tries, and finally an hour staking out a spot to see a parade and Fantasmic. The only reason World of Color could be seen was because of the FastPass. FastPass is clearly an admission that the park is over capacity. The Radiator Springs Race ride in DCA was a nightmare. The FastPass was gone within the first hour of opening and then the 80 minute wait without the FP was ridiculous. I'm not going to go over every area of the park because you have to expect crowds at Disneyland. But this is so much different from '95.In '95, we didn't have kids to feed. The $7 kids' meal is okay for kids under 7. Over 7, and you're paying $9 and up for everyone else before beverage. The food is somewhere between McDonalds and Red Robin quality unless you're in a restaurant. We avoided the restaurants because, for the five of us, we'd spend an average of $150 per meal (Blue Bayou, Ariel's Grotto, etc.). We did enjoy those restaurants, but mac n cheese was about all that our kids would eat there.Would we go there again? I don't know even though it is Disneyland. That it's not the same is clear. It is definitely corporate rather than family owned. Having accountants run any business involving people is a bad idea and it really shows. Personal touches are far and few and the goal to soak is clear. Risking people's safety and diminishing their experience by exceeding capacity and overcharging for lower quality food and customer service is really unfortunate and not the Disney I visited as a kid or later as an adult. I don't think the Disney  magic  has the same cache to the 'board'. In the end, if it's less 'magical' for the kids, then it's less likely that they'll want to return as adults and will choose to spend their $10K somewhere else.","Neutral"
"My 3 yr old and 7 yr old girls loved it very bit. The idea was to let them see the characters and hopefully make them beleive in the fantasy they create. Disneyland does that & more .... in style.The evening fireworks was spectacularThe villains parade and Mickey Mouse parade funtastic.The rides were so cute that my younger one wanted to keep doing them. It was indeed magical for the kids and the glee on their faces was worth every minute  nickel spent. We took the 2 day pass, did the evening parade and fireworks on day 1 and spend the entire next day on the rides for children. None of the rides are scary. The slow ones are where the kids enjoy anyway....The boat ride was nice with a lot of animatronics which thrilled the kids. The shows were grand too.Final tip : Go during the weekday and if it's a kid centric holiday take the 2 day pass and expect to get a bit bored since adult rides are few and far. The happy kiddie faces will however replace the boredom you face.Must visit for children of all ages.","Positive"
"It's way too overcrowded. The queues for the rides are 2 hours , too long for kids and too long for adults. Queues for food, coffee, toilets. Overpriced mediocre food with not enough seats to sit down. Few characters to see. Don't bother it's a rip off","Negative"
"If you have been to other Disneyland, keep your expectations low when visiting Disneyland Hong Kong.Featuring only a few attractions, smaller land area and water downed rides (uhmm yes... I'm talking about Mystic Manor). You can't help but compare this to other theme parks and Universal Studios SG offers more than this one.On the plus side, well there's no long queue here for the  It's a small world  attraction.","Negative"
"It's a trap. The only thing you can do is waiting in a line. Not worth the money or effort. I would bot recommend going there.","Negative"
"Disneyland was very disappointing, huge crowds, very long wait. We will never go back, it did not worth almost $100 entry fee.MovieWorld, DreamWorld, SeaWorld and other attractions at Gold Cost are better value, better rides and not as many people :) We went to Disneyland on Monday , hopping that crowds will not be too big. Disappointed.","Negative"
"Happiest place on Earth indeed! I forgot that Im 19 already! Hahaha! That fireworks mesmerized me. Teacup ride made me laugh. And the parade made me smile big, wave to the princesses and shout out my heart! How I wish I could go back in there again.","Positive"
"The best way I can review this is by describing the experience on the tower of terror ride. I've been to both the parks in the USA and now Paris. The team in the USA weren't only ride operators they part of the attraction. They were performers. The team in Paris were just going through the motions, directing traffic and reciting lines they were clearly bored of saying. Totally different in the USA.Could also do with some better signs.It is ok don't get me wrong. Kids will love it and a lot closer than the USA. Just lacks that organisation and level of service.","Neutral"
"I have been there few times and each time I regret. If you stay 8 hours there, you will enjoy attraction for 30 mins, remaining time is for waiting only","Negative"
"We are so, so disappointed. Before we left my husband and I were more excited about going than the children. We had such high hopes of having a fantastic 5 day trip there and had decided to go in December to add to the magic. Almost immediately our enthusiasm waned. We arrived at St Pancras to board the Eurostar and had expected some kind of friendly welcome but this wasn't to be. The only way we knew where we were boarding was by watching the monitors and by asking other passengers. My children helped themselves to the so called Disney Welcome Packs from the unmanned service desk. When we arrived at Marne Le Vallee, we headed straight to the Park while our luggage was sent directly to our hotel and had a nice afternoon looking round and watching the parades which I must admit were incredible. After a long day we waited 25 minutes for a bus to our hotel when we had been informed they ran every ten minutes. We finally arrived at the Hotel Santa Fe, why Disney would put their name to such a hovel I cant imagine.  Saturday and Sunday were absolutely awful, I expeced it to be very busy but I found the locals to be very rude and pushy. They dont seem to be able to grasp the concept of queuing like the rest of us. The Disneyland staff were at best civil and at worst completely arrogant, they would make short, sharp comments whether we were ordering in a restaurant or shopping in one of the stores, the only time I had a nice experience was in City Hall when a lovely member of staff went out of her way to find a screwdriver for me so I could put batteries in my son's camera, to her I am extremely grateful. We met another family there and they were as relieved to get on the train home as we were. Shame on you Disney :   (","Negative"
"Wow. How the mighty have fallen. I have not been for about 12 years and was totally horrified to find out how much the place has deteriorated. Quite a few of the rides were not open.    15 for a burger. The main cafe was filthy. 90 minutes queuing for a ride. The whole place is in need of refurbishment. Comparing it to Florida there is no comparison. Rip off. ","Negative"
"Took our six month son and really enjoyed our two and a half day visit. All the characters actors were massively engaging with him during the parade and when meeting them. The only downside from the overall offering was the food: you   d expect it to be expensive but very limited and some lunches were just beige! Queuing tendencies of other nationalities who are intent on sneaking a place or two   or an entire queue   were more hilarious than frustrating. Were given fast passes to use but found that they could not be redeemed on all rides and definitely not on character inspired experiences such as the princesses experience. ","Positive"
"Best family vacation ever! So glad we went before summer started as the crowds weren't too crazy. It was also very smart that we went in the middle of the week, which I would highly recommend.","Positive"
"We wanted to take our 15 and 10 year old here as their Christmas present. Prior to my visit, I researched the different web sites from different countries and was disappointed to find that the French web site gave the better deal by a long way. Why is there such discrepancy for the same product? It already felt like a rip off. I booked our trip in November for a visit in February. In January, I began to think about the pre paid meal plan and discovered that because we had our hotel booking through the French web site we had to book the meal plan through them as well. This meant that for exactly same product, we paid   28 more. Trying to phone the number on the booking was awful. Firstly, there was a 30 minute wait on hold, to be told that I needed to be transferred to someone who spoke English, was cut off, rang again, waited a further 45 minutes, found I was speaking to someone in America, who could not help me at all, had to start again. It took 4 calls before I finally was able to book, only to find that most restaurants were fully booked. Got a table at Silver Spur (was very tasty), but had to pay a further 28 Euros as our deal did not cover the cost, this despite asking the woman on the phone at the time of booking if we would have extra costs and being reassured that we would not. Had our children not been so looking forward to this trip, I would have cancelled at this point. I sent an email to the complaints line before we left, received a confirmation email explaining that they were very busy, but they would endeavour to get back to us within 15 working days. Still waiting...In the park, we had to queue 30 minutes for the extra magic hours. Why only have one entry point for all the people staying at the hotels? Absolute waste of time as most of the rides were shut until 10 am anyway.The queues for the rides were on average 45 minutes and we experienced many breakdowns whilst queuing which meant that the wait was a waste of time and the fast passes ran out before they were running again. On our last day, we managed 2 rides before 2 pm due to late starting rides, rides shut and rides breaking down. Took a chance with queuing to complain at City Hall and were given fast passes for 3 rides, which was something, but as we were leaving at 4pm that day, it was a rush to use them.We stayed at the Hotel Cheyenne, booking a room for 4 of us to share. Our room was small, but enough for what we wanted. However, there was a double bed and a sofa, which it turned out we needed to put up ourselves. Really?! Breakfast was horrendous, families fighting for space amongst the huge school groups and filling up on purely carbs   bread rolls, croissants, cereals, bread   with a bit of cheese and yogurts. We were told that the fresh fruit order had not arrived yet. All in all, this has been a very expensive trip which has left us feeling ripped off and disappointed with the whole thing. Definitely no magical experience what so ever. We are absolutely not going back again and will spend our money elsewhere.","Negative"
"We went to HK Disneyland thinking it would be like California's Disneyland but boy were we disappointed. Less rides and my four kids didn't have much fun. Our youngest is 9 and everything there was more for younger kids. There was a few rides that they enjoyed that weren't meant for toddlers. We had paid for the Vip treatment front of the line and a hostesses. Again I thought it would be like California with the huge line ups, many attractions and rides. Our hosts were great but I wasted my money with the VIP package wasn't needed. We went early and there wasn't any lines up at all. In two hours we had finished the park and the kids wanted to leave. Honestly they thought it was boring. They had such a great time at Ocean park instead.","Neutral"
"Normally I wouldn   t think of Disney as relaxing but HK Disney definitely is. We went on a Monday at about 11AM just to beat the crowd which was highly unnecessary. It was also super easy to get to by subway. The main part of the park was just opening and there were only a few people there. It is, as expected, much smaller than Disney World but still has many of the same attractions, just less of them overall. Because there were so few people in the park the entire day we never had to wait more than 3 minutes to get on a ride and since there aren   t that many rides we were able to do everything we wanted multiple times. However, myself and my friend I went with are both full grown adults so we only did a few of the rides that appealed to us so there was a lot of free time where we just walked around and enjoyed the scenery. The best part of the day was he food we had at the River View Caf   across from the Jungle River Cruise. They offer a    high tea    set menu which was excellent. Cute and delicious dim sum that definitely fills you up too. You can get other drinks as well since it may be a little too hot out for tea. And again since it was crowded at all we were just able to sit and relax. I definitely wouldn   t go if you   re looking to go on rides unless you   re travelling with young children. And as long as it is not a busy day I wouldn   t plan for more than half a day there.","Neutral"
"For 81 Eur per day per person one might have high expectations...My main issue is that too many people are allowed in, resulting in attraction waiting times between 45 min and 2.5r hours... I believe this is way too much. Your day consists of 90 % waiting in queues.... Children get bored, nothing is done to keep people in queues entertained...So overall I don't think it is worthwhile going mostly because of the long queues....","Negative"
"We originally booked a four day stay at Disneyland Paris for late last year but unfortunately one of our children became ill and we were unable to take the trip. Disney very kindly arranged an alternative vacation free of charge , when our insurance company proved very difficult which was incredibly kind of them.The accommodation at the Davey Crockett Ranch just 5 mins off the main park by car was excellent. The cabins were clean and modern and accommodated the 6 of us easily .The park itself was fantastic , the rides were great and the Disney staff were very helpful.The only downside was the cost of food in the park, which was very expensive.One advantage of staying at the ranch was we could drive to the nearest town and eat at some fantastic local restaurants.Apart from that it was a great experience and I would highly recommend the Davey Crockett Ranch as a good alternative to the hotels.","Positive"
"I know it's the original, but for anyone who has been to Disney World in Florida, you will be surprised even stunned  at the smallness of Disneyland. My first visit here was four years ago and I still can't get over how Disneyland is in the middle of a city and the smallness of Sleeping Beauty's Castle as compared to Cinderella Castle in Disney World. Lot to see and do...use Fast Pass as much as possible...Cast members not as friendly and be prepared for lots of line cutters who are meeting people up ahead...intolerable as far as that was concerned and most Cast members could care less...Great free app for iPhone and droid to track waiting times.","Neutral"

"Haunted Mansion is a must see with Halloween Christmas themed decorations. Several things closed due to Star Wars construction including the railroad. Usual crowds with one hour   wait for most popular attractions. Fast pass available for some attractions. You must show up at ride site to obtain pass then return at a designated time. Disappointing Disneyland is not going to implement Magic Bands like at Disney World. Fast pass reservation can be made online so no need to rush to ride site.","Positive"
"The price is now out of control for two seniors who like to visit and go on few rides but enjoy the atmosphere the young crowds at the happiest place on earth. We are Canadian and are rv'ing a few hours away so we need to get a hotel and tickets. With the exchange it cost us about $360 Canadian to go to the park for a day. It will be a few years before we return.Great place to be but has become poor value.","Negative"
"We just came back from our trip, and even though it was off season pricing (cheaper tickets) it was particularly crowded due to the President's day holiday. On top of that many rides were closed for refurbishment so lines at open rides were longer. But despite that we had a great time. We had to rent an ECV (scooter) to help a disabled member of our party and all the Disney staff were very helpful and able to get us passes to ride later as our party member couldn't get through the lines with her EVC. It was harder for her to get around because of the crowds, but that is no fault of the Disney people.","Positive"
"Arrived. Very hot, 30plus degrees, which is great, but waiting for sometimes 90 minutes for a 5 min ride, is shocking, stifling when undercover, could have done with some overhead fans. what we found is a lot of adults without children, we felt they should have adult day only or week once a month. Dont get me wrong it is for them to enjoy too but it makes the queues longer and the kids get bored waiting for so long. It took us nearly 5 days to do 90% of the rides due to the amound of queuing you have to do. Unless you get a fast pass, but to be honest spending 1500 on the holiday then having to fork out extra for fast pass was a no go. Drink and food prices extortionate for what you got, have eaten in some very high standard restaurants all over the world for less. my husband had saukraut and german meats for 25 pounds over in uk I shouldnt even think it would be 10 pounds in a restaurant. Worthwhile to see our 5 year olds face, exhausting, but good.","Positive"
"Does anyone not LOVE Disneyland?! There are not enough words to describe the amazing place called Disneyland....I am 62 yrs old & have been going there every few years since it opened!

"We had a great day at disney hong kong . It is spacious but not crowded with rides and stages. The main street in California and the sleeping beauty castle is always busy in California but in Hong king it is only busy during the parade whichis also not as the California parade but still nice to see it . Rides has long queues but anuway worth waiting as disney rides are really great.kids enjoyed the stage live shows .the festival of lion king and mickey wonderous story book was both amazing and really the airconditined stages are teally great in the hot weather. The electric parade and fire works were nice . Shops have different stuff than California disney land .Meet and greet characters are not the same everyday and hardly you can find disney princesses.mickey and minnie are there almost all the time.

"I am certain that when Walt Disney imagined his first theme park, he had no idea how successful it would be or that it would spawn further theme parks and resorts around the globe. However I'm equally certain that the idea of building a Disney theme park at the end of a forlorn railway line, in the middle of nowhere outside the capital city of a temperate   generally cold   northern European country would have been the last thing in his head (who knows, if the stories are true and technology moves forward enough, we may actually one day find out)Disneyland Paris is a misnomer, its like saying Wembley Luton. It sits outside of the city so involves a 40 minute train ride from Gare de Nord, or a    70 taxi journey from CDG airport, or an uncomfortable coach ride and THAT is just the beginning of the cash that will soon be leaking from your pockets or purses should you choose to visit the park.DP is nothing more than a testament to the corporate greed of an organisation that is hell bent on cynically exploiting children's dreams whilst simultaneously extorting as much money as possible through Disney branded merchandise.The cost of entry varies (anything from    40   60) and as soon as you are through the gates the task of getting you to part with as much cash as possible in the shortest possible time begins. The bombardment is perpetual, from the saccharin sweet schmaltzy Muzak constantly piped through speakers throughout the park to the gaggle of costumed cartoon celebrities and the Disney shops, Disney themed restaurants and fast food kiosks.Does it sound like I am bitter? Too right I am, especially as there is NO INDICATION before you buy your ticket WHICH of the rides WILL NOT be functioning that particular day.February 14th the following rides were closedPirates of the CaribbeanThunder MountainSpace Mountain 2Three 'thrill rides' that most visitors actually want to go, which meant that the thousands of visitors had to choose alternative experiences, leading to waiting times of well over an hour for each ride and the FAST PASS tickets for all the other 'thrill rides' being completely 'SOLD OUT' by noon. I was lucky enough to get one of the last FAST PASS tickets for one ride @ 11.45am (just one hour and fifteen minutes after the park opened) and was told to return for my ride at 17:05 So I had to kick my heels for well over 5 hours, waiting around   unable to go on anything but the really rubbishy rides   because the queues were too long.I calculated that the average person, would only manage to go on a maximum of four thrill rides in a seven hour period   if they were lucky and decided to eat on the hoof. Ridiculous.So what else is there to do, while you wait for your FAST PASS slot to arrive? Well, you could eat, or walk around from ride to ride shaking your head at the length of the queues, or you could eat, you could go on the only experience on the park with NO WAITING time: Armageddon (Yeah, no wonder   I mean does anyone even remember that film?) or you could eat and have a drink, you could try to avoid being beaten about the face by kids off their heads on sugar and armed with lightsabres, or you could sit down and eat in one of the restaurants, watch overweight 23 year women in Minnie Mouse ears attempting to eat foot long hotdogs, you could eat something, or gasp in amazement as obese LARPers in Darth Vader masks attack each other in the queue for soft drinks.Yep, it really is that much fun.So, when the allocated time for my ride came around I was ready. However, because of the closure of the better rides, the running time of the others were cut short to help accommodate everyone. Ridiculous.Even the Disney on Parade 'extravaganza' looked tired, populated as it was by worn out animatronic cartoon lions, etc. and 'Princesses' that wore so much panstick that they looked like marionettes.Ridiculous.Not worth the money, the effort or the waiting.But the kids seemed to love it.What's that noise? Oh, it's just the sound of Walt's disembodied head spinning in its cryogenic box.","Negative"

"Disneyland has always been a dream for me and I am glad that I did it but if I was traveling to the USA again I wouldn't bother with Disneyland. We had a 3 day pass and we managed to see everything we wanted to over the 3 days. Queues were way too long, some up to 3 hours, characters were too protected and plenty of people missed out on photos with them. Definitely spend the $100USD on a photo pass, it is worth it and plan your day ahead of time utilizing the fast pass facility over the two parks. It involves a bit more walking but it will save you waiting in lines. Take snacks and water with you food is ridiculous in price. $10 USD for a small hot dog and drink. My kids could eat 3 hot dogs and still be hungry. A water bottle is $4.50 USD, so take your own. If you want to stop for lunch exit the park and eat at one of the restaurants across the road and go back afterwards.","Neutral"

"We came 10 years ago for the 15th anniversary and thought we would come back for the 25th because it was so lovely...we made a mistake! It's dated, the rides have broken down constantly, the Halloween party was terribly themed (We heard others complaining about this too), The lines are so long you end up walking round doing pretty much nothing all day because they have zero crowd control here. The 25th anniversary is nowhere near as good as the 15th they have just stuck some projections on the castle and there are very little fireworks (good money saving effort Disney!) Needless to say we will never come back again which is a shame because 10 years ago it was Magical and a lot more effort was made by Disney. I'm sure kids will love it here but in my opinion Florida is a much better option and is not much different in price by the time Disneyland Paris has ripped every euro from you.","Negative"

"We spent 5 days in HK and the main reason for our trip for for us, finally to show our children Disney.As a former WDW cast member I have a soft spot for our famous mouse and in light of the fact that I met my wife while working for Disney Cruise Line it is often a very emotional visits to any Disney properties.Getting there is a breeze   use the subway we took 3 lines to get there and it took 30 mins   get to Sunny Bay and then you are transported onto Disney's very own rail system and they transport you to a lovely Disney styled train stop.First and foremost Disney do what they do very well, they have a level of guest engagement that all other parks strive for and that is exactly the case here in HKFrom the very moment you enter the park you come into contact with Cast Members who love what they do and that reflects in the level of service that you receive.The park is divided into 5 zones and if anyone has visited a park in FL for example they will be instantly familiar with the geography.Main St gives you a view of the Castle and an amazing backdrop of the mountains in the background.Adventure land, just like in FL give you the old west and the run away mine carts.A point of note, if you have kids and they would like to take part in Jedi Academy   make a point of going to tomorrow land first as this tends to book up fast.The majority of the FNB is centered around the local demographic and that being said I found it great to try something other that burgers and fries, which does tend to wear thin theses days.Parades   Disney do them so well the first starts @ 1530 and the night parade starts @ 1930   loved them.We chose to take a 2 pass and loved every minute of it.Great day out..","Positive"
"If you want to but tickets on the day (feeling spontaneous) you can only do it at the park not online which of course will cost you double. We tried to get fast passes when I asked the lady said they were included when we went to use a fast pass queue they said you have to add them on to your ticket but the machine is not working.Really important to actually read your guide as it will tell you when and at what time the parade fireworks and shows are.The food queues were so long the food was cold because it had been I expect been waiting to be served.Got stuck on the Buzz Light Year Ride which really scared the little ones . Queues are about 45 mins each we went on a non School holiday weekend so could be longer during those times.The parade was a the highlight for me one of the kids fell asleep before the fireworks as it was at 9pm but still had a good time","Neutral"
"This is our third visit to Disneyland Paris. The first 2 were when my daughter was in her princess phase....but this time it had moved onto the bigger rides.We didn't watch any shows or parades as we have 'done' them...but if you haven't I would strongly recommend catching at least 1 parade and recommend the motor stunt show at the studios. We visited on Friday 21 Feb and although there were enough people there we thought the queues were ok. We mainly manage our rides around the fast pass system. We loved thunder mountain, space mission and quieter rides like pirates of the carribean and the toy story parachute drop. The biggest shock for us was the crush coaster in the studios. In previous years the queue has been too big but we managed to get okn it this time...we thought it was going to be a gentle ride but it certainly was not. It was 'awesome' though and probably my favourite ride. I'm glad we hadn't got onto it in previous years as it would have terrified my daughter at an earlier age, and some of the younger kids coming out of the ride looked like they were in shock.We absolutely love Disney and the only reason I haven't scored it excellent is because a number of rides broke down throughout the day...which started to get a bit frustrating.","Positive"
"When we went most of the rides were closed as they were having maintenance, so we could go on them. Which left a lot of the smaller rides open which got crowded very quickly. the disney characters weren't out a lot and only got to see them once.

"I have been made to go there hosting family from out of town. Even when my son was young enough to be in the zone at DL he really hated it. The measure of unrivaled commercialism is rather appalling, long lines spoil the fun that could be had especially on hot days. Scarcity of good food. etc.","Negative"
"I have visited California Disney 2 times before in 2007 and 2010. This was our 3rd time to visit Disneyland but first time to go to Disney outside the USA. For the first time also I was taking my 6 year old daughter to a Disney park. She is a big fan of Elsa and Anna just like many girls :), and loves all Disney characters, knows their stories etc. Ok, Let me share some of my disappointments first   1. One thing we found missing was the courtesy in the staff at Disneyland HK towards visitors. There were less of helpers and more of process follower or policing staff in Disney land and this was something I have not observed in Disneyland resort earlier. Smiling and greeting attitude was missing in staff. It may be an ethnic or regional thing, as Chinese people seemed to be a bit rude in general (personal feeling, not to generalize).2. My daughter wanted to meet her favorite Disney characters but unfortunately she could not do. It was too much of time standing in the queues in the efforts to get a picture with them, but they do not even stop to allow taking a picture with them unlike in California. After standing in a queue for 2 hrs we could not meet Mickey and Minnie. I and my daughter just stepped out of Queue to get some food as she was hungry, but my wife was keeping our place in the queue, but when her turn came quicker than we thought and we got late to return just for 2 mins. we missed them once again :(. They could not wait on my wife's request as they said it was closing time for them (it was 6pm whereas park closes at 8pm). I immediately visited their guest services to request to allow just one picture with my daughter, but the reply I got was pretty cold  not possible sir .3. Overall the park is smaller in comparison with USA ones. but similarly ticket is also much lower than US; so it was NOT a disappointment. Now the good things  1. Ticket Price is very competitive. With the usual cost of everything in Hongkong, this is pretty decent price to spend a day with your family with experience of Disneyland.2. Travel easiness; with wonderful MTR network directly taking you to park, it is actually very convenient going to Disneyland from any part of the hongkong city.","Neutral"
"Have been here around 8 10 times with my family. Quite an expensive day out but if you're into all the rides there are plenty of them. Have put in place more security measures but what a nightmare! They have a 'no bags' line which was empty, so security were letting lots of people cut through this lane even though they had bags so then they were putting their bags through the security processes in other queues, making them a much longer wait time. Very disorganised and a lengthy process!!!! Very clean park, lots of eating places.","Neutral"
"The rides are very entertaining with the overall atmosphere indeed emitting that happiest place on earth vibe. However, prepare to spend considerable time on long lines for almost all the rides. Food is okay and staff generally warm except for the old guy at the entrance who snapped at me when I wasn't able to immediately pull my ticket from my pocket.The fireworks with its accompanying music easily was the best part. I thought I would never appreciate it as much as when I was younger but I did, maybe even more so. The parade was also way better than my last visit when I was still a kid. My kids enjoyed every minute of it.","Positive"
"I took my 2 grandkids to Disneyland on a Saturday. Spent 125 a piece to get a 1 day park hopper ticket. It was so crowded that we only got on maybe 6 rides all day. I would say the average wait was 60 to 90 minutes per ride, and even for the small kid rides, they were at least 40 minutes. We waited in one line for 20 minutes and did not move 1 inch. The food was exorbitant as well, spending 9.99 for a hamburger and fries. Next time I will go during the week or around Christmas when it is not too crowded. It was so crowded we did not have any fun at all. We wanted to rent an electriic cart for my handicapped husband and it was 70 dollars. We spent 35 dollars at other amusement Parks. I think Walt would be turning overi in his grave if he knew!","Negative"
"My family and I bought a 3 day pass to Disneyland. After researching and talking to a number of family and friends who had visited Disneyland we decided to do our own  itinerary .Our children are the ages of 5 and 6 years old.We stayed at the Super 8's. It is a fair walk to Disneyland however, children at this age should have a lot of energy, The first time we went to Disneyland wasn't until around 5:30pm. There was quite a number of people there however, when we went on some rides it was only a 5 10min wait. The wait is not as bad as what other people think. At least if you wait in line for a ride, the Buildings, decor and amount of detail and effort put into the premises are gretly decorated to each theme of the ride. Disneyland is huge and we didn't get to go on many rides in Tomorrowland but our daughter's did not mind because there was so much to do and see. We could have spent at least a week or 2 here exploring every bit of what it has to offer. If you are going to buy merchandise. SHOPPING TIP  I suggest you buy them outside of Disneyland as it is half the price and ALOT cheaper!We loved every moment of this place! And there is a lot of things to do for people of all ages.This trip was worth every dollar!","Positive"
"Me and a friend came here for her birthday and had an absolutely amazing time! Yes it might be smaller than the American version but it was still an amazing day, even though we had no children with us we had a ball :)","Positive"
"I can honestly say my 5days of Disney have been some of the most amazing I have ever spent with my daughter.Incredibly clean and perfectly stage managed I couldn't fault anything about it and the early entry for Disney hotel guests meant she got to meet all her favourite characters and go on everything she wanted.Use the fast track ticket system whenever you can it's free and beats waiting in a queue for 2hrs..We stayed half board and ate in different buffet restaurants which were perfectly fine for our need and the food was more than adequate.She loved the parade and the fireworks and cried when it was time to leave.We used Magic Breaks to book our holiday and drove there which was easy the roads were fine and clear all the way and a    21 toll each way on the motorway it cost us half the price we were quoted to fly   1300 half board with tunnel and afternoon snacks. I filled up twice at 60 quid a time and drove to Paris from Manchester and back.Drinks are quite expensive so I would visit the supermarket at Marne le Valley and stock up but there are fresh drinking points everywhere so keep ur bottlesMerchandise was very reasonable which was a nice surprise. Will definately go again","Positive"
"the overall experience of the place was terrible this was the 1st Disneyland I was visiting I was super excited it was disappointing long hours in queue even though it was a weekday it was hugely crowded!!Undoubtedly the park was amazing shows were good but for rides we had to stand in the queue for at least 90 mins fast pass did not help either So in one day we managed only 4 rides.I will not recommend Disneyland if you want to experience rides but yes if you want to show the park to children then may be ya but for 80 euro is it really worth it?","Negative"
"than Disneyland Paris. Compared with the Europa Park in Rust  Germany, it is much smaller and has much less adventure rides. We had a two day ticket, but one day is absolutely enough unless you want to spend the day by waiting up to one hour for a one minute ride. And that was in January. Fast lanes were existing, but some of them were closed. Even Mickey and his friends were not seen   might have been too cold for them.There are on every corner shops to buy these nice little fancy dresses, cups, costumes and other plastic trash, more shops than rides.The only good thing is that it is nearby Paris. My advice: If you want to see Mickey and his Friends, go to the next Disney store in your area instead of paying a hell lot of money for Disneyland Paris. In the Europa Park, you are getting much more for your money.","Negative"
"we went here a few years ago now 2 adults 3 children, though the 2 older children 6 & 9 years at the time thought it was great, our youngest at 1 year was scared silly by all the characters dressed up ;) unfortunately we went in a feb half term and the weather was dire, torrential rain, and even snow blizzards, so most of the rides were closed due to bad weather, we did manage to get the kids on a couple of rides which they really enjoyed and the 1 year old on an indoor ride which my husband hated every minute of with the childish music playing non stop. we also managed to get the breakfast with the characters....expensive for what it was, but again the 2 older children thought this was great. i am still glad we went and gave the children an opportunity to be at disney, the weather really let us down and made what could of been a great holiday into a bit of a horrid holiday.","Neutral"
"I visited Euro Disney with my mother and grandmother during a trip to Paris, and we all disliked the park very much. It was chaos and frantic with a very weird, charged atmosphere. Everywhere kids were begging their parents to but stuff and it was all about wanting more and more. You couldn't go there for a day because there was so much to do. This isn't a good thing, we all felt like we HAD to do it all, and there wasbn't enough time which gave us a weirdly panicked feeling. I went there when I was four years old and apperently hated it then as well, we went again to see if I would appreciate it more seeing as I am tall enough to go on the rides.It was good at first. There was a show with singing and dancing and it was very impressive with the big looming fairy palace and the pretty streets. We went to adventure land, and lined up for twenty minutes for a ride. Then there was pure confusion, as you got a ticket with a time on and could only go on the ride during that time. We thought we'd just go on the ride then so it was a bit of an anti climax to be given a ticket, but we looked at the map and saw that these rides are 'fast pass' rides. By then we felt a bit depressed about the place but were determined to have a good day... yeah right!It was chaos. Little children looked plain confused about the place, and personally I didn't get the concept. It's meant to be about magic and imagination but I thought it was an outdated and old fashioned idea. A twenty minute line was considered short, and the longest we waited was forty five minutes for a ride though people were waiting for an hour. The food was overpriced, kids were high on sugar and screaming, and unlike the last time I visited there was no interaction with characters. I remember meeting Snow White but we didn't see any of that. It was like a museum, you had to admire the set from a distance but you weren't part of it, for example the ride round the park we were expected to 'ooh' and 'aah' at stuffed animals in the 'wild.' I think children benefit more from hands on activities, especially if they're too short to go on rides.So we were fed up and went to the other park in the same sight, the Disney Studio Park. We liked it better, it was less busy with less kids running about and had a calmer, less frantic feel to it. in the other park it felt like we had to do everything and eat everything and buy everything. We waited for forty five minutes for the Rock and Rollercoaster only to hear a tannoy saying it had broken down and we'd have to wait another hour. We couldn't be bothered so the only thing we went on in that park was a Toy Story themed ride that would have been at home in my town's annual fair. There was a 'tram' studio tour that was in fact a lorry, and we drove and looked at things from films like 'Dinotopia'. There was a part when a barrel went on fire and the lorry rocked about but I wasn't very impressed.So overall, it's all about squeezing more money from parents as kids want to experience everything in one go. You'd have to stay there to experience everything at the park, but in somewhere as culture rich as Paris, who'd want to stay in Disneyland? I wasn't impressed at all. DO NOT waste your money there.","Negative"
"Your children will thank you forever if you go here, and if you're going without kids, you will thank yourself. It is a happy, magical place and if you're a bit hesitant about the whole Disney thing, it's more of a reason to go, you'll be converted. It is a wonderful wonderful place and you can't not be happy here. If you're staying in or near Disney then TOP TIP: Get there early, and you'll get on more rides, then go home and nap during peak times (1 5ish), maybe eat out somewhere out of Disney as it will be much cheaper, e.g. Denny's   that is where we ate, then go back in for the evening where it will slowly get quieter again. Go on the most popular rides at first thing.There is no better place!!","Positive"
"My advice to others Keep away its not cheap and not worth the money. Not enough rides and waiting time per ride are around one and a half hours. I was expecting something Magical:0 but Horror :() Trust me you dont want to on a 35C heat during the day with your little kids. If you are in HK I would recommend Ocean Park much more rides and much cheaper.","Negative"
"The most negative was the waiting times , and that we could not get a coffee without waiting another 30 45 minutes.Also food !!!!!!

I did bring my 8 year old daughter to Disney world","Neutral"
"Loved another visit to the Disneyland park, still very busy for the time of year which I didn't expect! Was a little disappointed that two big attractions were closed at the same time for refurbishment (Big Thunder Mountain and Space Mountain) when i booked I was aware of the big thunder mountain closure but didn't expect space mountain to be closed at the same time! Loved the Disney dreams show in the evening! Loved the parade! Will return in the future!","Positive"
"Let me first say that I am a huge Disney fan and have been to the Land and the World many , many times. That said, my family and I just returned from a trip to So Cal and were disappointed in the changes that I noticed in the parks. First of all, I haven't been to Disneyland since 2003 but this trip I saw TRASH thrown down in attractions and cups left on benches and gum on the pillars. I have never in all the years I have been going to Disney seen anything like this before. I think it is probably a combination of things that has caused this. One, there were way to many people under the age of 20 without adults to influence their behavior and two, I think Disneyland is vastly under staffed. I was given a photopass card upon check in at the Grand Californian but over a 5 day visit found no photograghers in the parks. Disappointing to say the least.Finally, for my birthday we ate at the Napa Rose. The food sounded fantastic but was mediocre at best and VERY expensive. The food is better and cheaper and any number of restuarants in the World. I will not be returning to Disneyland any time soon.","Negative"
"Initially I thought what would I do there, its for kids. I was their because of my girl friend. And Thank God i went there. This place is for grown us too. I was not surprised why kids are crazy fir this. Its a huge set up I must say. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Especially the roller coaster ride. It was great. Highly recommend. I will be back. Thanks","Positive"
"Brilliant place for kids and adults. 3 full days. You need to get there early as possible as queues in afternoon are long. No additional cost for fast pass tickets, but you can only get 1 ticket until you allocated time starts, you then have 1 hour to go on the ride. The busier the park is the longer wait you have for each fast pass before your allocated time. Drinks and food fairly expensive. We bought the city pass for Sea World, Disney and Universal. Out of the 3 parks Seaworld food was best value at $35 for an adult all day including as much food an drink as you want. Universal studios,great day but fast track passes aren't true fast track passes, as you only get 1 ride on ft pass and for $85 bucks this is a rip off. At least Disney don't charge for their system. Seaworld you can pay $20 for unlimited passes all day which is good value for what you get.","Positive"
"I have been to many theme parks, this is the worst!They have more retail shops than attractions. You hardly see any other tourists from other countries except those from China. This Disneyland seems to be only suitable for mainlanders. This theme park has no queuing order, staff are not well trained. There is not enough shelter for visitors to take a break especially in Summer. I can't imagine if it's rain, where can the visitors go? There is no staff to control the queue, mainlanders are cutting queue as usual. The park do not control the total number of visitors for the day, it just seems over crowded. Waiting for a single attraction takes more than an hour. You just waste all your money and time waiting and waiting then you got to find out that they have a system called 'Fastpass'. Those visitors who got Fastpass can enter first. This is really ridiculous as who on earth a first time tourist will know where and how to get a fastpass? The park is small and for the services they provide, it just not worth the price and live up to the name of Disneyland.The MTR station also did not provide enough ticketing machine for visitors to purchase tickets. The stupid machine only accept small notes and coins. There is no staff to help you. You have to wait another hour queuing to finally get your train tickets. The train station equally sucks!Overall, you just felt like after they took your money, they just leave you to die. They don't even care if you had fun or can go home safely.My final advise; this park is only suitable for the locals and visitors form China. Don't even think about it.","Negative"
"9:30 in the morning we got sent to overflow parking... Bad sign. Two mile walk to park through downtown Disney no tram... 40 minutes still not in park wait 30 minutes in line to get in and all ride have 45 minutes wait times, too many people to even walk down the street just way to crowded for a Thursday in late April. I cant even imagine what it is like when it is full? We will not be coming Back just not worth the cost and the crowds.","Negative"
"My one previous visit to Disneyland was in California and I was quite impressed which means I had positive expectations of this trip with a ten year old. I just cannot understand the hype about it. We stayed in Paris travelling by metro to Marne La Vallee. These are our personal observations.1. Lack of staff   we spent some time in a separate part of the park looking for rides and were eventually told   you have to go to Disneyland  ( which was next door   we were in Studios and did not know it, no proper signs   see below). There was never anyone to ask for directions to coffee places and very importantly toilets and the rides. 2. Signage was amazingly poor   needs to be larger esp for toilets: you have to up on top of it to see it Maps very sketchy and not clear to me.3. Etiquette: as an example queuing an hour for Pirates of the Caribbean and sitting behind a woman who saw nothing but through the lens of her permanently flashing camera. Not Disneyland's   fault  but irksome nevertheless. 4. No giant MIckey Mouse s! Or other characters, as other reviewers have said, as in USA.5. Expense of very poor food: I prefer not to eat meat but not much choice here: one very thin beefburger and one hot dog cost over   15. And you had to queue for half an hour to get it in a cardboard tray.My overall impression was that this must be mass hypnosis. The child I was with said   one or two rides were good but the rest was rubbish . The very young children, the girls in their fairy land dresses, know no different. Good part? I was amused to hear that,   at least she can tell people she has been to Disneyland . Does this emperor have any clothes?.... If you want something a lot less than the (discounted!) fifty pounds each ticket, the very best option is Jardin d'Aclimatisation at Sablons, near La Defense ( best hotel is Frazer Hospitality a brillant new self catering with breakfast hotel) The Jardin has great rides at 3 euros each, free attractions, the occasional dromedary and other animals and snack foods costing less  La Plage   the Seine Beach in August   is free. And don;t let the language barrier put you off. But with small children and without a you may of course go for convenience. ...and maybe it is all about saying we have been to Disneyland? Brilliant marketing. I think it is a cynical rip off living off the very well promoted Disney name. Perhaps Disneyland belongs in America   and it is bigger there ( of course ) . Some people go time and again   but I have to offer our personal experiences   the child loves rides and was predisposed to love Disneyland   but she joined me in hunting for the exit.","Negative"
"I honestly believe this is the best theme park in the world. I think it has the perfect combination of big exciting rides and a heart warming atmosphere. I have also visited Orlandos and Paris' Disenylands and I believe Anahiems is the best park. My only negative would be that you need to spend a few days there to see everything, however it is obviously better to have alot of attractions instead of too few.","Positive"
"We've been to D land many times. It never gets old. I do appreciate going in January or February even when raining. The locals will leave and the lines shorten. I like walking down main street and looking in the shop and Pirates is always fun.","Positive"
"This was our third visit to Disneyland Paris and we were extremely disappointed. There was a lack of characters around the park and were only a few meet and greets which resulted in long queues. Waited 2.5 hours to see a princess. There were also a lot of attractions that were closed and ones that were open were breaking down regularly for example crushers coaster. Due to this, all the other attractions had much longer waiting queues. There was also no parade at Universal Studios and only meet and greets were Mickey and buzz which I thought was extremely poor! Also Discoveryland was extremely poor due to the closures! We also went for breakfast in plaza gardens and there was no cutlery, cups or plates available to have our breakfast!! We wont be going back here!!","Negative"
"The trip to HK Disneyland was a blend of good and bad experiences. Firstly it's a bit expensive travel to and fro in MTR form Hong Kong or Central station to Disneyland. The entry ticket pass is also expensive. The only recommendation I would give is if you have been to any other disneyland's in the world or especially paris, skip this one for sure. There's no need to waste your time, money and a whole day for this place. I have been to another 3 disney's including paris and I am telling you from my experience. It is seriously not worth it. If you have kids who are under 15 then you can surely opt a day out in disney but if you are traveling adults or teens like me in early 20's then it's a strict no. They don't have any thrilling rides for adults or teens. Though the whole idea behind creating a disney park is for children but they should keep in mind that children are not the only age group that visit. Besides it is so packed and flocked. The queues and waiting times are very long and lengthy. There's not much seating space with shade. The food and drinks in the disney are way too expensive. Not much choices for vegetarians. The Ocean Park is a very good alternative for Disneyland. You can choose Ocean Park over Disneyland on any given day and you surely won't regret it. Kids will surely love disneyland but not all age groups I am afraid. The evening lights in the park are very pretty. Hence we made a mistake and sacrificed a day which we could had utilized for a better purpose.","Neutral"
"Went during spring break.......wouldn't recommend that time of year. It was so busy. Hard to get on rides and spent a lot of our day waiting in line. I would definitely advise the phone app to give you wait times. Not always accurate, but helpful with deciding where to go next. This was our first trip to the California Disney so not sure when they started (or if they have always) taking your picture for multi day passes. To stop everyone, scan the ticket, compare the pictures etc. in line made for a long wait just to get into the park and then to get in line to wait hours for rides seems like a very inefficient system. Plus, it kind of freaked me out that they were taking a photo of my kid.... Also, last time I was at DisneyWorld, you could only pull one fast pass at a time. You couldn't pull another until you used it. Nobody mentioned until our last afternoon there that you can pull one every hour....big waste of time standing in line. We did have fun, but I wouldn't go during spring break again.","Neutral"
"Have been to Disneyland in LosAngeles and the crazy crowd and long lines and wait times for the rides are tiring. Also tiring is the huge size of the place. So if you dont want to wait in lines for eternity and have fun in a controlled environment take your kids here on a trip! Most rides had a wait time less than 15 minutes giving enough enthusiasm to line up more than once for a few rides! Awesome fun and great with small kids!","Positive"
"Have been to Disneyland Paris several times over last ten years, and have to say was disappointed this time.Too many years of under investment are starting to show, Far too many rides shut at the same time, too many breakdowns of the remaining ones and things like toilets shabby and or dirty. Staff in the park generally good, helpful and friendly, the few exceptions we may have caught on a bad day, or asked the same question a thousand others has asked before.","Negative"
"Park is Magical for kids and adults unfortunately toddlers don't understand you have to queue for each ride for minimum 30min so it's hard.worse even when in the middle of the queue your toddler wants to go toilet...would definitely wait that kids are like 8 or 10 to go back.i can't imagine how long are the queues during school holidays or summer time...","Neutral"

"My daughter's knees dislocate and so she was in a wheelchair. The people working the shuttle buses were amazing. The ones running the rides were hit and miss. I had a party of five, three of us big girls and two skinny. At the Teacups and the Haunted Mansion there was no concern about whether my hanicapped daughter and our group made it completely or safely into the seats of the ride. One of us almost got hurt at HM and one of us lost our place to ride at Teacups. So busy we only got on seven rides in 11 hours, only two of the rides eligible for fast passes. Went May 21. Also paid $50 flex for CA Adventures to find false advertising on tv because the Pixar stuff was not done. Overall, felt like Walt is rolling in his frozen tube. The workers were about 75% not caring and 25% amazing. And the difference was that vast. No in between. We also spent well over $1500.","Negative"
"I've been to DLP back in 2002, and last week it was my 2nd visit. Everything has changed. Toilets are dirty, many rides were closed and the queue to rides were quite long... we're only have limited options for rides. And some of the theme park's staff were not that friendly.","Negative"
"My wife and I first went to Eurodisney within a few weeks of it opening in 1992, and with no experience of anything to compare it with we were impressed. The crowds weren't silly, the staff were friendly, the rides were geat (I still love Thunder Mountain!), Disney characters wandered around the park, and some of the restaurants rest areas had some great entertainment   I recall stopping for lunch somewhere and being entertained by a fantastic country band. Overall a good experience.Fast forward to 1996 and I went again as part of a corporate event and stayed in one of the Disney hotels. Again, the crowds weren't bad (though it was February), there was some fantastic entertainment around the park, and overall I enjoyed the trip.The next time I went was in 2002, with my 6 and 7 year old daughters. OK it was the summer holidays, but the crowds and queueing were beyond belief. Forget using the park railway, the queues for that were impossible so we walked, and walked, and walked. On top of the crowds I was disappointed that the Disney characters and entertainment I'd seen on previous trips had gone. The kids enjoyed some of the shows, but we struggled to get on more than 2 or 3 decent rides. Overall a disappointing day out.Our final (and we'll never do another one) trip to Disney was in 2006. We went at a different time of year thinking that keeping away from the summer holidays would keep the crowds down. Well, we paid the E180 or whatever it is to walk through the doors, and soon wished we hadn't. Crowds everywhere, 90 min queues for the popular rides, and E10 for a disgusting burger. Never never again, my kids were very upset by 3 4 pm as we'd only mangaged to get onto a handful of rides due to the overcrowding. We've no intention of ever going back again, the only way I'd go back is if Disney pay me and it would need to be a decent amount too! Also, be aware that if you're visiting the park by car you'll end up parking about 20 30 minutes walk from the park entrance. I've tried to balance the review as in the early days I enjoyed going there, but the park has lost a lot of the charm it had and seem to me to be overly greedy in exploiting families who feel that a trip to Disney is compulsory. Well it isn't!","Negative"
"If you are in Hong Kong and are even slightly interested in anything Disney including the  new  franchises, then a visit Disneyland is a must. All the classics are there, including a trip on  It's a Small World , while the Pixar, Star Wars and Iron Man displays bring Disney up to date. There is literally something for everyone at the Hong Kong Disneyland   even the journey on the Disney MTR is fun.","Positive"

"Decided to do 3 days at Disneyland instead of trying to stuff everything into one day and we were very happy with our decision. We were able to take breaks and not feel like we needed to be constantly moving. The only down side to this trip was that quite a few of our favorite rides were closed so that is the reason for the lower review rank. Otherwise still one of the happiest places on earth.","Neutral"
"Where do I begin, I travelled to this park with three nieces and nephews, I must say that they won't remember the queues, the ridiculous price of things or the total lack of everything that I expected but here goes. I did expect queues and food on the pricey side which I don't mind paying but being blatantly ripped off is really not my thing. The queues for the rides were simply ridiculous. We waited on average 45 mins to an hour for a 3 4 minute ride. After all that nothing spectacular or mind blowing at that. Over an hour wait to have a photo with any of the characters, of which we saw 3 during the whole day (almost 12 hours) Minnie, Aladdin and the Chipmunks. Forget trying to find a Princess to have a photo with one of my nieces, although every second little girl was wearing one of their dresses from the  dress up  shop which started at    70. Having read similar reviews and my experience there is no way I would return or recommend this sham of a theme park. But you know what, my nieces and nephew will only remember the time they spent in Disneyland with their family and I'm sure they have fond memories, and that is why people continue to go. Just hate being exploited and ripped off.","Negative"
"My boyfriend and i had a wonderful day at the park. I felt like a little girl, so happy. We bought the tickets at the entrance. You can buy them online but that is 24 hours before the visit only. We thought there was a dinner show and the customers service confirmed and at the entrance as well. When you had a look at the location for the dinner show, there was no show that day. Also nowadays the park has fast pass tickets option in the normal ticket. But if all the fast pass tickets are used they close the line. There is a limited amount of tickets per day. I think that is a lack of communication towards the customers. I thought the parade was just breathtaking! If I had known that there was no dinner show and that the fast line would close when they were out of tickets, we should go but we would be prepared for what to come.","Neutral"

Basically the place was over capacity yet they were still selling more tickets to let more people in .. more people than park facilities could handle and it was chaos , , I was expecting that the park will be busy , but there should at least be some limit on how many people can practically park can handle , this made experience for little kids very stressful . Teenagers and adults seems to be dealing with it fine but queuing for a 2 minute ride for over 60 minutes was frustrating for little ones . It was my second visit and it will be my my visit , DLP may have their marketing strategy but I have learned my lesson , never again ..","Negative"
"Xmas eve was great not a lot of people, and Xmas day was very busy. Bring your snacks for long lines. I lost phone on first day, and it was turned in and send to my house.","Positive"
"Our children are slightly older and so we were disappointed to find that some of the best rides were closed and many of the restaurants were also closed. This meant that the things to do were limited and all the crowds were funnelled towards the same attractions, meaning large queues for everything. It started to feel like a cattle market with people just being herded between the rides. The best things were the parades and liv shows and the early bird priority ticket was also good. One day was plenty of time to do everything we wanted to do.","Neutral"
"The most important thing to note is that I grew up going to Florida Disney 2 or 3 times a year. I have also been to California Disney a few times, so I cant help but compare. I feel like this trip was a waste of money in all honesty. We went in April and did the trip  on the cheap  I suppose. We took a national express coach from London to Paris overnight and it was such a time and money saver. We got to paris about 6am and the coach was comfortable enough to sleep, obviously a bit disruptive to have to get off at customs Eurotunnel but other than that, pleasant. The round trip was only   100 total for 2 people which was a total deal. The train to disney was something like 15 euros total from Gare de Lyon, which we walked to from the station. As you can imagine we got to Disney well before parks opened. The few shops restaurants there were pretty rubbish options. We had McDonalds for breakfast. When we got into the studios park, Tower of Terror and Indiana Jones were clsed for the day. Aerosmith wasn't as good as Orlando. Over at the disney park, we had an alright day, watched one parade, Space Mountain was really good actually. The Ratatouille ride was brilliant. Lunch was awful  not enough options, we wanted to eat a restaurant but only 2 were open and not good choices, so ended up having a crappy hot dog. We left the park by 4pm because the day jsut wasnt going well. Our trip to Paris in general wasn't great but honestly, if its feesable for you, save your money and go to Orlando  that is the disney that I know and love.","Negative"
"I don't know where to start! This is a magical place that everyone falls in love with. It's so clean and friendly and fun!Yes it's got q price tag to get in but so worth it.

"We visited on Monday 5th January 2015 with myself my husband ,our 5 children between ages of 4 & 14 two of which have special needs. It cost us $684 dollars to gain entry for the day. We were told before we the day of visit that due to us having children with special needs we would be able to get a pass to be able to book a time on a ride to go back at a later time, what they don't tell you is that you have to wait for that ride & ride it then book on another which left us unable to do anything for over an hour after every ride. It was a particularly hot day reaching over 80f & the park was way to overcrowded. The most distressing part was definitely after the fantasmic show not only do they sell everyone out to make you buy extra tickets to be able to see it but as we were trying to get out of that area with a wheelchair a special needs stroller & 3 other children it took us 45 mins to get back to Main Street . I am absolutely disgusted that this place has turned into a money printing factory instead of the happiest place on earth we had the worst time on earth Disneyland you should be ashamed & sir Walt will most definitely be turning in his grave","Negative"

"I am truly so sad to be writing this, I   ll start by saying I saved for months to take my children here to this magical place it claims to be not for just children but people of all ages. We went for my daughters 9th birthday myself and my 2 children, one of 9 and one of 2. We arrived at 11am both dressed for the occasion (Disney characters) queued over 1 and half hours to get to the front of the 1st ride and be told it was closed due to technical issues to them go to a second ride and que for 35 minutes for the same thing to happen again and to be honest there was about 6 rides not running, then try and meet some characters 1st was belle 2nd was tigger to be told they are going on a break, honestly myself and my children walked and waited for hours I cried to my daughter saying how sorry I was that her birthday had ended up so bad I felt awful, there was nothing magical at all about this day. We then waited for the parade which really did cheer us up as I got us to the front and made sure they knew it was her birthday they did make a fuss as they went past but apart from this the park was way too, pure greed to let so many in took the shine off everything. I will never save so much money again and come here. I   m just so glad our hotel was amazing (Vienna dream house castle) or out holiday would of been one big flop. I really hate to write a bad review but I feel other people should know what they are going into","Negative"

"we stayed in the Disney hotel   the cars   it is worst than a travel lodge. cramped rooms with poor facilities. Breakfast was ridiculous   you were allowed one slice of ham! the park itself has hardly any characters in it   it was raining the weekend we went but we didn't actually see any apart from the parade. we booked breakfast at Mickeys diner   which is extremely expensive   and it was a good job we did or my son wouldn't of met any characters at all.

"This was the first visit to Disneyland for myself, my husband and two of our grandsons. We were so disappointed by how dirty the park was especially the bathrooms. Didn't find a clean one the whole 4 days there. The prices at the nicer restaurants are outrageous averaging $250 per dinner for the four of us. 90% of the staff i.e. Cast Members were unfriendly and some down right rude. Fast passes for the more popular rides were sold out by 10:00 AM every day. We were told we would get early admission one day with a multiple day pass but when we tried to use it we were told it is only good on specific days of the week. It was our last day, a Thursday and not valid on that day so we were turned away. We found the same scenario at California Adventure. We would never return to this place and wouldn't recommend it either. We go frequently to Disney World and will be going again in August this year. We have NEVER EVER been disappointed there.","Negative"

"One of our reason to stay at Marriots Village when we visit Paris is proximity to Disneyland. However, we were quite dissapointed with our experience. We have been to Disney California and our expectation are high.We bought 2 day passes to enter both parks. The escalator from the parking lot does not work both days going and coming out. It was a long walk until you really get to enjoy all the rides. The roof covering the walkway from the carpark is leaking badly and it was raining during our visit with water driping like a drain from the ceiling.Some of the rides are closed for maintenace. The staffs are not friendly or informative as a Disney employee should be. This is a land of dreams and imagination and we expect all employees to act their part throughout our rides. They are not enthusiastic or proud of the character the are asuming be it as a ride attendant or salesmen at the many souvenier shops. Maybe we are spoilt by the atmosphere we feel in Disney Anaheim.......the costumes, the greetings and the enthusiasm.The ride to visit the studios to see how films are made is a real ripoff. The TV monitor are not working properly and some transmission were cutoff that makes the narration and the sight we are seeing off tangient. the show are lame and not worth the time spent waiting in the cold for the ride.The furnishings in the theatres are old and threadbare. However we did enjoy the shows put on even though we can see the cobwebs on the ceiling.We felt cheated for the cost of Euros 770 we paid for 2 days 2 park for the 6 in the family. We will not recommend you to visit this park. If you want a real Disney experience, go to Anaheim California, not this half bake park. Its a shame to the Disney trademark","Negative"

"Walt Disney never disappoints in any part of the world, a family oriented affair through out the day through the evening.

"What a disappointment. We (young couple) went for our anniversary but really it was only enjoyable if you fancy standing in long queues. We went on a Monday, hoping that it was be quieter but the lines were at least 60 90 minutes for each ride. Only having a one day pass it meant we had no chance of seeing all the rides.I had researched the fastpass system but I don't know how it works as every ride we went on had the fast pass booths closed so we had to wait for all the rides (or at least the ones we could be bothered doing).We won't be going back!","Negative"
"the evening show is AMAZING . very nice, the park is very nice,the cleanness of the toilet is excellent lots of place selling water ice cream  coke. etc.on the other hand . you need to wait and wait and wait in the queue for ever, we stay from 10 am till 12 midnight we could only do 3 ride. !!! to take a picture with mickey or minnie you need to wait in the queue for more than an hour. !!! we wanted to go another day however we were too tired . book online . better than waiting in the queuewe booked Disney land and the Disney studio. however it is so difficult to do both in the same day","Positive"
"This whole place feels like an homage to the 1990's. The parade was basic; the rides broke frequently or were already shut for refurbs. We waited 35 minutes in an allegedly fastpass queue because they were allowing people regardless of timing to join (big thunder mountain, the only  big  ride of the day that was open). Disney studios was better but is tiny. Most rides don't have fast passes, so we waited for 2 hours to watch the ride break in front of us! Restaurants were either shut or full or fried food. Mickeys cafe was basic food but again, we had a booking and queued for 30 minutes. Valentine, our  waitress  was rude, forgot things and mixed up the order completely. Hotel (Santa fe) was basic. Again queue for breakfast, no one pays attention to the time slots. Best thing here was planet Hollywood. And that's saying something. Whole place needs some investment and magic putting back in.","Negative"
"Monday and Tuesday were supposed to be  ghost towns  according to projections. Nope. Busy. Secondary screening and sniffer dogs used on us several times upon entry. Intrusive. Disney townies and cults permeated the experience. Food was disappointing and expensive. Numerous employees were sullen and looked bored. Of course, a couple of great memories were re lived and some of the rides are fun once you are on them. Lines are reported incorrectly on the disney app.","Neutral"
"Its Disney, its worth a visit. but we went on a hot day on a Wednesday. midweek thinking it would be less people. I was wrong. there must have been a million people or more. Im not kidding! it was soooo crowded. we only were able to ride some kids rides that only had 40 minute waits. and a couple others because ppl started lining up for the parade. the rest of the rides were 1 hour plus and many were 2 hours or more. if you have the $ and don't want to spend the entire day waiting in hot lines with no coverage from the sun get one of the ride passes. this visit was so unsatisfying. It has been 10  years since my last visit and I don't think I feel the need to ever go back. they need to limit ticket sales so that you can actually enjoy some rides (but they wont because disney wants the $). they need to put up some sort of sails or something to give people coverage from the sun while waiting. you wait in line to park. you wait in line to go through security. you wait in long line to actually enter the park. you wait in extremely long lines for rides. Essentially you pay to wait in lines! i do have to admit the food services were good. fast service and tasty food. that's it the only positive.","Negative"
"Stayed here for the first time during May half term with my 12 year old daughter. We both had a great time but we will not be returning as we did and saw everything and we feel it's more for the younger ones. 10 and under will absolutely love it as nearly all the rides are suitable for any age. We were so tired from walking around the parks each day so take comfortable shoes. The food is quite expensive but we found some restaurants that do chicken and rice with a desert and drink for around 11 euros. The disney dreams show is on quite late but it's amazing, not to be missed.","Positive"
"We had a four day pass which I think was perfect for our family of 5 with a 10, 16 and 17 year old. The staff everywhere were always helpful and polite.

"If the Earth were to ever take an enema, the site would be here at this hideously overpriced, broken down artifact from the 1950s. Disneyland Park is the flagship of old Walt's evil plan to take over the world. And it seems to be working, since Disney, Inc. satellite  parks  have sprung up like poison mushrooms all around the globe, even in Paris. Disneyland shamelessly separates rube families from their hard earned cash with shockingly high admission fees, souvenirs made of crap, and junk food at sky high prices. Several of the aging main attractions were broken down when we visited. The implicit message from the parent corporation running this rank obscenity is that you pay through the nose, then get the hell out as soon as possible to make room for more suckers. You won't find a drinking fountain, a shady spot, or a place to sit down anywhere, so be prepared to get exhausted by being on your feet all day and for your kids to go bonkers overdosing on sugary drinks. You'll lucky indeed to avoid getting your toes flattened by one of the bloated legions of  Handicapped,  morbidly obese scooter riders you'll see everywhere who get to crowd to the front of the endless lines at the few rides that are working. And you won't be able to find a good drink anywhere either. But take solace that you can decompress when you leave what I call my version of hell on Earth with a well earned series of Martinis at Morton's about a mile away.","Negative"
"This is one small crowded Disneyland and to be honest, the tourists that frequent this place aren't the most considerate. Definitely my least favourite Disneyland.","Negative"
"It's huge place to be covered in single day but must say dream come true for all Disney fans...loved the parade show...lot of food options so no need to carry food inside..just avoid Sundays as it's get too crowded with local public also there...took lot of time to do a ride","Positive"
"For me visiting Disneyland was a awesome experience. This is specially for kids but everybody can enjoy there. They have many rides but they are not scary at all for adult those are really fun. I really had a feeling that I was In a dreamland. They have 1 and 2 days pass but if you visit the place in the morning that you can complete complete in one they. At 8 pm they have fire show which is really nice. But if you come out from there at 8pm then the train will be really crowded. You can buy tickets online or at the airport or at the Disneyland as well. They don't allow to use selfi stick inside. They have many restaurants inside so, ratting is not an issue. This is once in a life time experience so, I recommend every to visit there once.","Positive"
"This place is suitable if there is a child in you or you have a child yourself. A great place to be with your family. Me, myself, I got bored in less than 30 minutes.I love that this brings back my childhood but I wish Disneyland could add interesting activities besides sightseeing castles, parades and all. Most were only children family, which were appropriate as a family theme park. The Pinocchio ride was, for example, not exciting at all. Yes I love Pinocchio, but it was a pretty boring ride. Maybe, most of you disagree with me, but after one hour, I just couldn't wait to get out of Disneyland and enjoy myself somewhere else in Paris.","Neutral"
"HKG Disneyland was an expensive disappointment. Time and money better spent !  Go to Ocean Park.  Especially if your hotel is on the Island side.","Negative"
"....I had very low expectations to begin with. Visited Disneyland Park with two children (3 and 5) in August. I was impressed with the layout and overall appearance of the Park and getting in was fairly easy (we already had our tickets before travelling there). Despite being high summer the ride queues weren't horrendous and in any case our boys are not big fans of rides anyway so we could just enjoy strolling round. Autopia probably wasn't worth the 30 minute wait and we were able to get a FastPass ticket for Buzz Lightyear but on returning found that the ride had broken down. It's a Small World is great for young children and the queue was very quick indeed. Pirates of the Carribean in hindsight was a mistake   parents NB there are two steep drops during the ride which aren't advertised so be warned. We were lucky to stumble across a group of characters when walking round (The Chipmunks, Goofy and Donald Duck) and they were excellent with the children, really bringing the characters to life despite the restrictions of the costumes and ensuring that children waited their turn.We ate in the Hyperion restaurant near Space Mountain   this was abysmal; a thirty minute wait (mainly thanks to the incompetent staff) for alleged fast food which was over priced and of poor quality. The dining room itself was good with large TV's playing Disney cartoons to entertain the children. We waited until 7pm for the parade and were glad that we did   it was excellent and the highlight for our children at the end of the day.I wouldn't go back in a hurry but am glad that our children were able to enjoy the day and take away some special memories of their visit.","Neutral"

"I've brought my family to Disneyland and Disney world many times over the years. This time we stayed at the disneyland Californian grand adventure hotel which I do recommend. Staying on property gives you the amenity of early admission which is awesome! Also this particular hotel has an entrance for California adventure which comes in handy. However, the park itself was disappointing. It seriously appeared to be oversold as I can't imagine it was within the safe capacity. The main thoroughways were shoulder to shoulder continuously after about noon each day we were there. The entire crowd moved at an extremely slow pace, frustrating everyone. To make matters worse they began blocking off the main thoroughways at about 7pm for the parades, light shows, and fireworks. This made movement of the crowds near impossible. Forget trying to get to any of the destinations you were planning to get to. At the same time they close down 2 full sections of the park, toontown and fantasyland. This shoves even more people into less space. And to brighten your evening the cast members are there to continuously tell you to  keep moving  when the the entire crowd in front of you is standing still and there is literally no possible way anyone can move. Another odd change is that, there are long line areas where they used to have the lines but now they keep the guests waiting outside in the heat and let a few in at a time to make the long walk in the air conditioning where people standing outside could be (and used to be). I understand that a day at Disney with crying children causes high stress, but there's been a change since my last visit to Disneyland as the tension seems to start with the tone of the cast members.","Negative"
"I myself have been to Disneyland a few times, but it was my boyfriend's first time. I was so upset to find that some of the biggest attractions (Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones, It's A Small World) were all closed. We would have spent a second day at California Adventure. Kinda was a waste of money.","Neutral"
"Needless to say, our group (including two teens) was quite frustrated with the experience at Disneyland Paris. Perhaps we've been spoiled by the attractions at Disneyland and WDW, but we expected more. During our visit, several main attractions at the park were closed either for scheduled maintenance (how ludicrous it seems to schedule maintenance on premier attractions such as Space Mountain at the beginning of the summer season) or closed due to undetermined technical issues (as was the case with several rides, including the Rock    n    Roller Coaster). Lines at several popular rides (Thunder Mountain, Crush Coaster, Disney Railroad, Ratatouille Indianan Jones) were over an hour, and several do not offer fastpasses (and some fastpass systems weren't operational!). Shorter waits at Pirates of the Caribbean and Phantom Manor. Early morning access hours don't give guests access to any of the headline rides, better suited for the younger set. We agree with other reviewers here: we won't return until Disney invests in bringing the park up to date, improves the access to rides and schedules planned maintenance at better times.","Neutral"
"Let me preface by writing we have been to Disney Florida and Disney California. Took my 4 year old twins to HK with me on business and decided to bring them to HK Disney as a treat. My children are biracial Caucasian Asian. I am Caucasian, mom is Asian.My son has light brown hair dark blonde hair and hazel eyes with some minimal Asianfeatures (e.g., no epicanthic eyefold so his eyes look more Westen while his bone structure is more Asiatic). His twin sister has a darker complexion and aside from medium brown hair eyes, she looks like a light skinned Asian toddler.My son was constantly hassled by Japanese and Korean patrons in the park, mostly obnoxious women between the ages of 30 40 years old who not only asked completely inappropriate and racists questions of my wife and I, but also thought it acceptable andOK to take selfies with my son. One of the women, a woman from Osaka, keptreferring to my son as  cute half breed boy. I put a stop to this after around the 8th or 9th Japanese Korean woman did this (mind you this was in the first two hours we were in the park). The final straw for me was when we went to a Disney stage show and the had an Asian woman made up in black face paintperforming a circa  1950's America  song a la Beans & Cornbread in front of a thousandlittle kids.Given the insane price of entry, small size and limited features of this Disney park, notto mention the  merchandizing attempts  every five feet and the profoundly racist experiences we had to deal with, I am crossing this off as a  we'll visit them again  place for the kids. The Ocean Park nearby is much better and nobody thought my childwas a park attraction toy for taking cell phone photos.I'd skip Disney HK and opt for the stateside parks. Maybe we will try Disney Shanghai with better luck.","Negative"
"The train from CDG airport was    50 and it was literally 5 minutes each way... then the one day ticket for just the Disney park was close to    80. Exceedingly expensive considering I personally didn't enjoy it that much due to the below reasons. I arrived at around 2pm (the trip was unplanned as I was stranded in Paris for the day due to cancelled fligjht and this was the closest option that was also not affected by the train strikes in Paris). When I arrived the sun was scorching which did not help the overall enjoyment. I paid to put my bag in hold (around    7 for full day which was reasonable) and then passed through the security barrier. There were no maps provided at the entrance and for the life of me I could not find one in the whole park. You have to download the app   which also provides wait times for each ride which is helpful   however if you have no internet data you have to accept being lost the full time. Through the whole day I went on 3 rides   3 roller coasters. Having been to many theme parks in my life I am quite accustom to long wait times and can generally handle the most vigorous or  terrifying  roller coasters that most  thrill seekers  enjoy. I waited 75 minutes for the Indiana Jones roller coaster, and it was over within 40 seconds. This was possibly one of the most boring roller coasters I have ever been on, with very low speeds and one loop. Certainly don't recommend this. My second attempt was the highly recommended Space Mountain. I must say the queue structure for this ride was very strange and maze like, but with some of the highest wait times in the park I guess they had to be imaginative. The special effects before the ride were great, however the ride itself was OK. Personally I don't think it was worth the wait but certainly better than Indiana Jones ride. The last ride I had time to go on was a quick decision on my way out the park, and I can't remember the name of it but it was the Star Wars roller coaster. This was absolutely fantastic!! The effects and effort put into this ride are incredible and would be enjoyable even if you haven't seen the movies!I happened to be in the park for the 25 year anniversary so there were a few celebratory events. I attended a few shows   the Princess Ball and the Parade. The Ball was fantastic and all the actors were great, however the multi lingual aspect made it hard to follow. The Parade was fantastic and probably the best i've ever seen however waiting on the ground for 50 minutes previous in the blinding sun in order to get a good view was not ideal. My trip to the gift shop provided a huge shock as there are very few price stickers, so when I went to the til with 4 magnets and was asked for over    30 I had to consider my priorities. I ate in a  Cindy's Diner  type environment (I can't remember the specific name) and this was very nice however also was overpriced. I only seen 1 entertainer or character during my walk around the full park so if I was a parent I wouldn't be too happy. I'm not a huge Disney fan however I did appreciate the magic in it all, which really is the only distinguishing factor that separates it from other parks. I wouldn't recommend going if only for the theme park aspect, this is really only a place to be enjoyed by kids or super fans.","Neutral"
"Since noon time 12 I reach to front door Disney land , until 6 pm , I only can visit 5 game stations , it is really big land and long queuing for many places , the food choice only fast food inside , expensive but not good taste , near by main door the chineses resteraunt must wait 1 hour to get seat , next time I will bring own water and sandwich carry to there , the most game I like is iron man , and mystery house among the games that I play ; they close at 9 , if you bring you kids go there better prepare some water and snacks also going to there a bit ealier morning .","Neutral"
"My family and I had a delightful trip to Disneyland Park last week. The magic was in full swing despite the toasty temperatures. Happily, we were able to visit all of our favorite attractions thanks to their FastPass system. The Cast Members were as friendly and helpful as ever (they always are the cherry on top  they sure know how to make things magical for park guests). We will be back to our 'happy place' next year!","Positive"
"Wonderful experience for families, with a lot of exciting adventures and fantasy world scenarios. If possible, I would avoid weekends as waiting lines can take up to 70 minutes for some more popular rides.","Positive"
"We got a deal through a national newspaper which meant this was a relatively cheap trip. If I'd paid more I'd have marked it down further. We went in February so the weather's bound to be a factor and it rained when we visited the park (we went to the studios on day 2). Not a problem then except that the park isn't really geared up for rain and cold   there's a shortage of seats inside and nowhere really to have a drink and warm up a bit   at least if there was we couldn't find it. There aren't many indoor attractions at all really so maybe a winter visit was a mistake. There were some good rides though especially Thunder Mountain and we found the FastPass thing very useful   get a FastPass ticket from the machine, have a wander for half an hour, then go straight to the front of the queue. As far as ambience goes it all looked a bit, well, out of place. There's barely an essence of Europe in there which is good if you like your American theme parks but it does suggest a lazy facsimile of a Disney template. It lacks some magic and sparkle   there are merchandise shops everywhere and it just didn't work for me. My kids (6 and 3) liked the Studios better. I think Euro Disney needs to step up a bit as I think we'll be going across the pond next time as it has to be better than Paris...","Neutral"
"The queues for rides and to meet characters are so long that you will spend most of your day doing that   not my idea of fun but my 9 year old seemed to think it was worth it. She was happy to wait for 2 hours to get a minute or two with a Disney Princess and an expensive picture.The shows and parades are amazing   those performers work so hard and the lightshows and fireworks, fire breathing dragons etc are amazing.Catering was awful   I expected it to be overpriced and very average (and it was) but not for the service and availability to be so terrible. At one point were abruptly turned away from the Deli on main street   just told  we are closed!  We noticed by chance it was open again shortly after   looks as if it may have been a shift change. It still took ages just to buy a toasted sandwich and a drink. We gave up at the steakhouse after waiting ages then being seated when on one came to take our order after agesMy 9 year old remarked a number of times about the numbers of people smoking in the park. It's no smoking in theory but it isn't enforced.Our room in the Santa Fe was Ok, but our bath had someone else's hair in it   and the corridors were strewn with housekeeping carts and laundry.We won't be rushing back to be relieved of more than a month's wages in three days (and I'm not badly paid   or at least I didn't think I was).","Neutral"
"Went to Disneyland yesterday, my first time. Was quite good but I had expected a bit more. Quite a few things weren't opened. You had to pay to get a photo of the characters, you couldn't just get a photo yourself. I thought you would have the characters just wondering around. The rides were quite good, but does cost Aust 100 dollars so not cheap.the parade at night is worth staying for was excellent. The fire works too were good!A good experience , but would work out expensive with kids as that's what it's for!","Neutral"
"You have to do your homework to attend the park. At one time there was a quieter time, but now with year round school it is very hard to judge a good time. When the park is busy it is not the best place to be, the lines are way too long. I find that the food is very expensive at the park for families. I would check everything online to find the best way to enjoy your day or days while being at the park","Positive"
"If you go there   buy a fastpass (4x the normal price). Otherwise you will spend literally 85% of time in ques. And our visit was on a weekday in February!!! Cant imagine what its like in higher season.","Negative"
"Fantastic place to visit we had three days a I think that we just managed to scrape the surface a little disappointed that some of the attractions were close for the winter period but whoever would recommend the park to anyone friendly staff and people a good variety of places to eat not over priced as some theme parks can be the night light and water show was fantastic went and watched it 2nights","Positive"
"We drove and got to the park at 10:30 then waited 1 hour to buy a ticket for both parks for 2 adults and 3 teenagers. This cost over 400 euros. When we eventually got in at midday none of the fast passes were working so it was between one and two hours queuing on the big rides. Some rides were broken. We left at 7 and had gone on 4 rides. The staff were nothing like American Disney staff, the rides weren't even as good, loads of people smoked. Do not go here if you get the chance go to Florida it doesn't compare.","Negative"
"I am going to have to agree with my fellow reviewers. Disneyland is way too crowded. The crowds make it difficult to really experience the magic of Disneyland. My husband and I tried to go to Disneyland on Monday morning and the security lines were backed up into the drop off area. I think Disneyland security needs to be trained by Disney World security, much more efficient in DW than DL.I still love Disneyland but after this year we are going to let our passes go and take a break for a few years.","Neutral"
"Extremely average rides. Please save your money and go to Universal Studios in Singapore! They don   t get anywhere close to creating the magical experiences they promise to! The park was too crowded with sections shut down for renovations. After paying for an entry it seemed like you are eternally in a queue for rides or exhibits that were extremely disappointing!","Negative"
"Maybe its because the park is too small as compared to its american cousins or maybe its the proximity to the worlds most densely populated regions but it was a nightmare navigating through the unusually large volume of people and this was on a weekday and when we had reached the park before it opened. Food is terrible and a rip off.","Neutral"
"One day trip to Disney Paris today. Lots of fun, 3 kids, if chilly. But why were all of the restaurants closed after 6pm? We had to make do with pizza burger fare, a shame   we walked from resto to resto, each were closed for no reason. In the cold, not much fun. Disappointing   suggest you check with Disney on whether they do this piecemeal or as a plan.","Neutral"
"Went to D land on a Wednesday in March hoping it wouldn't be crowded. Hadn't seen the park in over 15 years. It was almost standing room only on Main Street. Calfornina Adventure's BEST ride, Soaring Over California was closed for refurbishing. The Mattorhorn in Disneyland was closed for refurbishing. My wonderful memory of the Carousel of Progress is now a hike up a two story ramp into multiple rooms of corporate sponsored advertising. Overall, total bust for me. I don't think this is what Walt Disney had in mind.","Negative"
"We spent two days at Disney in October. Oct 9 and 10. Oct 10 was Friday. We had gone to California Adventure first and the first, second and third ride we attempted to go on were broken! Radiator Springs Racers were broken at Park opening and we weren't even allowed to go close   were told to try again in 2 hours, Then tried California Screamin. Broke just as we got in line. Then went to Grizzly river rapids   closed too....Waited 30 min for Soaring over California and went to Disneyland. Rode Star Tours a couple of times and then went to Indiana Jones   30 min line   we were in the underground portion of the line and it stopped moving, lights came on   BROKEN  We were stuck in there for about 30 min before they got it working again. We got kicked out of Disneyland at 7pm so that they could have the Halloween party there. For this trip we paid $210 each for 2 day park hopper tickets   so this day cost us $105. I figure it was about 20 per ride and we got to wait 30 min for the privilege. I think they let too many people in the park and for a tourist paying top dollar it is just not worth it. This was supposed to be a non busy time too. I do not plan on a return visit anytime in the future.","Negative"
"If you go to Disneyland Paris with realistic expectations then you will have a good time. I arrived with the expectation that it would be  the happiest place on earth , but this is not the case at Disneyland Paris. The staff are disinterested and unhelpful. In fact, when I asked for assistance to get into a boat from a moving platform that was wet from the rain, the staff members response was to ask why!!!! Rather than explain to her that I didn't want to slip and fall into the water rather than the boat, I just walked off in disbelief. Another problem was that there were no characters walking around so the only way to get your photo taken with a character was to wait in line for 1 2 hours. It was school holidays when I visited so I expected the characters to be out and about, greeting all of the children. Also, the toilets are disgusting. On a positive note, the parade was great and the Disney Dreams show at night was really magical. To get a great position for the parade, go to the road in front of Sleeping Beauty's Castle at least half an hour before the show starts and sit on the kerb. Staff will come along before the show starts and ask you to stand up, but you will be right at the front and have a great view as the parade passes by. The shops are great but are a little expensive. I spent 2 days at Disneyland Paris and once I was able to put my expectations behind me I had a really good time.","Neutral"
"Arrived at opening time on a one day ticket with my 11 year old daughter, first ride we approached was not open and they could not give us a time when it would be, this also happened on another ride. Pirates of the Caribbean ride was not going to be open at all that day, but the next day which was no good to us, another attraction we approached was not open, and a show we went over to see were told was not showing again that day. The rides we did go on were great, however having visited the Disney parks in Florida on a number of occasions, we found many of the staff were disinterested in giving you a good time, and did not look happy to be there, and for the price you pay for a ticket you should expect more attention and rides which work. Save your money if possible and go to Florida instead, it is worth the wait.","Neutral"
"2nd visit to Disney hk but found it more interesting now. My 4yo kid & 2yo kid enjoy their trip as they played about 10 games. Good !","Positive"
"My family had been to many Disneyland and Disneyworld visits over the past couple of decades. My kids are now all teenagers. Really made the mistake of not checking the crowd tracker websites before booking.Spent close to $800 for a family of 4 for a one day park hopper with the online Fastpass option. Apparently, Oct.6 was so crowded that their Fastpass app crashed by 11am. I was not planning to drag my family around the park getting paper Fastpasses. Even the Guest Services near the entrance had a 1 hour line of guests complaining about the Fastpass app trying to get refunds. It's been 2 weeks and my email request for Fastpass option refund has been non existent.Our family ended up going on 3 rides total. Can you imagine a 3 hour wait just for Haunted Mansion? I personally saw people just scan their pass and scoot around the Fastpass crowd. I personally heard from some of the guests in the Fastpass lineup that that some where just scanning their hand and getting into the Fastpass lineup with no valid Fastpass. There is no visual scanning indicator or second scanning station like Disneyworld. Just ridiculous. Unfortunately, will be our last time for Disneyland California.","Negative"
"Just returned from 3 nights there. Many rides are closed currently as they are upgrading for 25 year celebrations. Big negative was the number of people smoking around the park   really bad when crammed together for parades   shows. Staff turned a blind eye often and only saw one person asked to stop smoking. There's also a selfie stick ban but again not enforced   I'm 6'2  and watched end of day through others mobile phones as struggled to see over everyone. If only they would follow US example and get everyone to sit so kids can also see. Many around us saw nothing. If you have the choice, go to Florida rather than Paris.","Neutral"
"smaller in comparison to ocean park. personally speaking its more for kids below 10 12 but i may be wrong. go early. buy tickets well in advance. buying from klook is an option. be ready to walk a lot. food inside is expensive.","Positive"
"We pre booked our ticket online (cheaper and less queuing time) which granted us access to both parks. Easy enough to find your way round, however be prepared for long queues. And don't forget that you will spend A LOT. We went to Aladdin's Moroccan buffet for lunch and paid nigh on 30 Euros EACH for the buffet and a drink which FYI tasted awful. If you are wishing to purchase any merchandise, then don't expect to pay less than 20 Euros. I travelled with my boyfriend and we are both 24 and 26, the fantasy land is more kid orientated   we preferred the Universal Studio park which had bigger and better rides. Disney Princess outfits are going for 70 Euros! I read that Euro Disney loses millions each year, which I think explains the ridiculously inflated prices. Never in my life have I paid so much   you wouldn't at Florida. Having said that we had fun being big kids for the day but would not return.","Negative"
"This is certainly one for the kids, despite the rain that poured for most of our stay. We were only a short walk away from our hotel, but having to queue for EVERYTHING (in some cases more than an hour) became a bit much for our 7 year old. Great fun for the kids and young at heart adults, but surely there must be some way of managing the queues, or at least providing entertainment to keep the youngsters occupied?","Neutral"

"You will love this place for the fun, food and the nostalgia it creates! Even when you are not a great mickey fan, you have enough avenues to enjoy.   Its not just for kids; even adults enjoy this.","Positive"
"Disney has great customer service, great attractions and shows. The drawback is the crowds are so large, even on a Tuesday, that you stand in lines the great majority of the day. The light show and fireworks show was great. However due to the huge lines, we were very limited to the number of rides we could take. Space Mountain and California Scream roller coaster were great. Don't waste your time on The Matterhorn, it is so jerky that it is actually painful. Nemos submarine ride is a dud. The Mr. Lincoln attraction is interesting, but parts of it are very dated. The tickets are very expensive and even with  fast pass' the waits are atrocious. You can get much more bang for your buck at other Southern California theme parks.","Negative"
"I would like to let anyone know if they are thinking of booking a holiday to Disney Paris, DONT DO IT!!! I have been to Florida Disney many times and loved it as have my family, I am 31 and still love the 'magic' atmosphere and sparkle you get in the parks in Florida. Disney Paris is so far removed from this and I couldn't wait to get home, the day dragged and the experience was terrible, rides lacked the fun in Florida. Everything so expensive and not worth the money!!! Disney should remove their name from this place and just charge them for using the names of their rides, this place ruined the trust and good name of Disney, it was tatty and dirty and not very well put together. The Disney hotel we stayed in was Newport Bay Club and it also ruined the Disney name, employees couldn't be bothered and the halls stank of dirt and BO. Just save up for that bit longer and go to Florida, it is in another league altogether, cant wait to go back to Disney Florida next year, and that is the only thing that got me through the nightmare that was Paris, knowing I was going to Florida next year. I had my 14 year old daughter and 15 year old niece with me and they hated it also.","Negative"
"Our family has made many trips to Disney World so we thought Disneyland could not possibly compare. But we found that we loved it. The convience of the two Parks was great. We loved how all of the rides started outside which is very different than Orlando. And it did not seem as crowded which was surprising. Absolutely loved the classic rides but did love Cars Land and Soaring especially after traveling Route 66 and around California. Hope to visit again.","Positive"
"First, let me say, I love Disneyland, BUT...we went on a Tuesday (June 7th), and the crowds were a nightmare... this is the first time I've been to Disneyland where I wanted to leave as soon as I went through the main gates... But, I forged ahead, since my son was with me and wanted to go. People were packed into the park like sardines, it was just awful. We have Socal Passports, and maybe that's part of the problem! Like others, I think there are too many local people visiting for only half the day... and it's making this a miserable place! Time to stop selling annual passes, since it's no fun to go anyways, 9 times out of 10. Please, Disneyland, do SOMETHING about overcrowding... we were there for 7 hours and we went paddling on the canoes, went on Pirates (although it did break down in the middle of the ride) ... and Autopia w Fastpasses and that's it. Everything else that I saw... easily 45 min waits, if not more. What else... we didn't want to wait 2 hours for Star Tours (Fastpass was sold out) so we missed that... Big Thunder Mt.(my fave ride)  CLOSED for the day... I did enjoy the tostada I ate for lunch though... so one highlight! Maybe this was just a peak day for crowds, although we also went in March on a Wednesday and it was almost as bad. It's really a joke going when it's this crowded. And I felt very sorry for everyone who came from out of state!","Negative"
"Just spent the day at Disneyland and CA Adventure. Spent about 155 for a park hopper plus hotel (158.00). Average wait was 90 minutes in CA Adventure. The big rides were down. CA Screamin was down for the four hours we attempted to get on it. Additionally several other rides were not operating. At Disneyland Space Mountain was down all day, Space Mountain was down for the first two hours, Indiana Jones broke down mid ride and then 1 minute into the second ride, and other rides were down for sporadic amounts of time. We spent more time going around trying to get on a ride then being on a ride. The fast passes were limited so we could not get enough of them to actually prevent waiting for a hour and half for a ride. We ended up leaving the park at 6 PM because we just got tired of waiting.","Neutral"
"Dont waste your money going to Disneyland, we spent over   200 on tickets for 1 day for a family of 2 adults and 2 kids for 1 park and only got to go on 4 rides all day! The queues are massive, 3 hour waiting in queues...Thats not enjoyable for kids or adults. The rides are nice to look at but very boring, no thrill! My youngest really wanted to see Mickey Mouse but he was no where to be seen and neither was any other character! Very dissapointing day for our family...","Negative"
"It's Disneyland, of course I love it. Mother and Grandma first took me when I was 18 months old and many times after. Now, three decades later, I love it still. The mint julep at New Orleans Square is as pretty and tasty as I remember. Space Mountain still makes me scream my head off, as does Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. The teacups are still a favorite ride, especially when Husband rides with and spins us so fast! Can't wait for our next visit!","Positive"

"I love DISNEYLAND! My family and I have taveled to the park a lot. I LOVE ALL THE SPECIAL DECORATIONS AND EVENTS FOR HOLIDAYS BUT I THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT are in the park during the special ial occasions is making very hard to enjoy the park. It isn't cheap to go and when there are so my people that I find d I hard to walk I am going to plan the rest of my trips during the slowest to es possible. I will make sure to check ahead for parades and fireworks because I ant miss these.","Positive"
"It is a must have trip if you have kids! Got the kids dressed up in princesses for them to enjoy this magical experience. My child was given a birthday badge by the hotel and she could pin in and get recognised in Disneyland. We have received complimentary ice cream at restuarant and some staff would wish Happy Birthday.However, it is prob my last time gg to Disneyland HK as the 1) Lion King show was the same as 10 yrs ago. 2) experience of being pushed by rude mainland Chinese in queues was not pleasant at all. Perhaps Disneyland SEA in Japan would be a much better choice.","Neutral"

"I have been to Disney Parks (Orlando, Paris, Anaheim) many times and this truly was the worst experience yet. We purchased Park Hopper Tickets. While in the park, one show was cancelled five minutes before it was supposed to start (we waited in line for 30 minutes), rides were closed due to technical difficulties. The food was partially disappointing. And Disney advertised Halloween themed decorations. There wasn't much of that. I was very disappointed, since I love Halloween and expected Disney to go all out. The Europapark in Rust, Germany does a way better job and Halloween doesn't have a real tradition in Germany.We wrote a letter of complaint to Disney's customer service, but never heard back. In 2015 our experience was better for the 75th anniversary, but I don't think we will be back to the park anytime soon.","Negative"
"We were excited to visit for the 60th year celebration. However, the long lines and broken down rides put a damper on our spirits. Still enjoy the Disney atmosphere but seems some cast members in California could use a little refresher on the  Disney Magic.  Certainly not as friendly as Florida. It is convenient to walk from park to park and not have to take a bus.","Neutral"
"beautiful scenery all around,food choice is rather limited,it is an international village to the full meaning of the expression","Neutral"
"Like the studios in need of a large cash injection. Too many attractions with brokendown displays. Unhelpful staff who have little commonsense or initiative when dealing with visitors. Impossible to get a basic ice cream for a young child!! Ben and Jerrys closed till mid evening? Queue times very very optimistic and food prices high for poor quality. Not the park it was 5 years ago, having visited many times since 1998.","Negative"
"Disneyland Paris doesn't have same feeling as Disney in Florida, the staff are rushed off their feet (doesn't seem enough of them) pleasantries are few and far between and at times the organisation was pretty dangerous (i.e. Only having one gate open as thousands of people tried to leave the park after midnight on New Years! So dangerous and a little frightening with people pushing and shoving). Queues are LONG and take forever, on average we waited 30 mins to be served for a coffee. I wouldn't recommend going at this time of year with temperatures as low as  5 and a piercingly icy fog it was unbearable at times and hard to try and keep small children's fingers and toes warm! We had a good holiday but we made it that way by turning a blind eye to some of the less than magical behaviour of the staff. We found if we avoided the fantasy land part and headed straight to frontier land or adventure land the crowds were less and it was far more pleasant. Fireworks seem to lack the luster they used to have and the lighting of the castle is beautiful but feels like cost cutting as now fireworks are reduced. As expected prices are phenomenal and without the perpetual joy and happiness you expect from Disney really didn't feel pleasant to be paying through the nose but without the Disney feeling?!","Negative"
"We had a brief and expensive outing here and will not be returning. The queues were ridiculous, it was a tad scruffy and all in all a big con. Hong Kong is incredible, this lets it down big time.","Negative"

"Great transport by train from Solihull to Disney. The Disney experience was appalling. Stayed in Sequoia Lodge, the door lock system does not work, the manager admitted that it was a 1992 system that badly needed replacing, but they had been refused permission to spend on the replacement system. Far too many rides and food outlets were closed, frustrating a lot of people. Rides also breaking down too much. Before going I doubted the French' ability to emulate their parent company's country's ability to host such an enterprise. Our visit only confirmed that it is not in the nature of the French to make you feel welcome and the events special. On the Disney channel in room one of the claims was that you can relax as all the on park transport is free, well no it isn't, some is but the train that takes you from your accommodation to the park entrance is 2 euros per person. Not in the Disney spirit at all. As for the breakfast experience at the lodge, despite the genuine and good natured efforts of the far too many black faces that do the menial work, the experience is one of being cattle herded. Very poor. Finally the name of the park defies the trades description act. It is not EuroDisney at all, and should be renamed FrancoDisney. It is very French, which would be fine if that had been what it was marketed as, but it is not. Thank heavens that we have a great family, otherwise this trip would not have been enjoyable at all.","Negative"
"Let me preface this review by saying Disneyland opened when I was 4; so my expectations and excitement were higher than usual. A huge disappointment! No happy characters greet you at the gate or were ever in sight. Two to three hour waits for rides. Food was horrid. Shops redundant. We left within three hours. A miserable experience. For $110 one would expect to be at least mildly entertained.","Negative"
"Visited in August during school holidays and it was too busy. Didn't have a choice of dates as we went on a bus trip but wouldn't go again during school holidays. Queuing for rides was ridiculous, especially when we had qued for 2 1 2 hours for the new ratatouille ride, only for it to break down just as we got to the front and be closed and when we asked about a fast pass when it started working again we were told no, not very good customer service. We had to pick only a few rides that we wanted to go on due to the time it took to do each ride. Food and drink very overpriced, but i guess that is the same at all theme parks. We made the most of the water fountains, taking bottles of water and dilute juice to cut down on the cost.The Disney magic show at the end of the night is good but if you have a child or are short then you cannot see what is going on as the crowds are that big and most of the lights are focused on the lower part of the tower which unless you are 6' you cannot see, the fireworks and effects are good though. There was also an issue when you were leaving at the end of the night after the show, as everyone was trying to leave at the same time there was a dangerous bottle neck effect at the turnstiles to get out, causing a lot of pushing and shoving, luckily the member of staff on the gate where we were opened the door where the pushchairs are allowed through and let people out that way. Overall, I would love to go again to be able to go on the rides we had to miss out on but not in school holiday time and will be taking my own food to cut down on the cost.","Neutral"

"Received Eurostar tickets today and seat numbers after looking at the train plan to discover that their are only disabled toilets in first class coach   s 9 and 10 we have been put in coach 15 with no disabled toilets . We made Disney aware when booking that their is a disabled passenger traveling in the party and were not told that their are only disabled toilets in first class if we had we would have upgraded at the time . But now Disney have said to upgrade we would have to pay a cancellation fee and rebook at today   s prices which is significantly more than when we booked just so she can access the toilets which is a basic human right . As for Euro star they are unable to help as the booking is though Disney not them .All they can do is let the driver know so he can check on us . I am amazed that nobody has had this happen to them and that disabled toilets would only be in first class . Our only option now is to wait and see if we can upgrade on the day at the station . Really disappointed as this is meant to be a treat for my daughter 18th birthday and wanted it to all go smoothly. SHAME ON YOU DISNEY LAND","Negative"
"Well I wish my review could be different as I love Disneyland and always have, but not this time. We travelled their Feb 19 24 and were sadly disappointed and may not return. The staff who used to be so friendly were mostly bothered by the tourists, I was shell shocked as I remember staff being so friendly and part of the magic, but now it's just like anywhere else. I especially noticed that the people working the rides seemed almost annoyed; they wouldn't smile, barely spoke to you and rushed you through like cattle. I actually was shocked when I asked the girl running the buzz light year, if they took a fast pass, she looked at me and shook her head no and then turned away. I remember the park being so friendly and happy, but not anymore, I think they need to work on their training. We paid full price for our hopper passes, and expected some of the rides to be down as its low season; but at one point, Indiana Jones, The old railroad, Pirates of the Caribbean, bobsled ride, Grizzly, Ferris wheel, Screaming California and the carousal were all down. We paid a lot for these tickets and half the rides were down, which then made the few rides with 160 minute wait, like ridiculous. The food at the park was terrible and so expensive, but on a positive note ESPN outside the parks was awesome and so was the Rain forest cafe. All in all if you go, be prepared that staff are no longer as kind and friendly, losing the magic of the park, and its becoming just like anywhere else, over priced, broken rides, with little to no customer service. We have gone every year for the last five years but think we will be switching to a beach vacation instead, which makes us kind of sad but unless things improve its just not worth it :.(","Negative"
"Our whole family went to this place at the end of June 2014. Primary goal of our vacation to Hong Kong is playing in this park. We went by MTR from Jordan Kowloon heading to disneyland. Disney themed MTR is very interesting and full of families with young children. We had not buy a ticket online so had to queue up first. The queue was not too long, only 10 people, but spend 20 minutes to wait. We had a great time playing and watching a variety of shows here. There is one game that needs special attention is Space Mountain. It was not made clear that this is a Roller Coaster, and since the location is inside a building it looks like a normal train game, so many are not vigilant. If you are indeed ready, healthy and strong please try. In the queuing time, there is a special entrance for those who are not able to continue. There were souvenir shops everywhere. Sell       goods at a price that needs serious consideration, the price is relatively expensive. There are restaurants everywhere, providing Disneyland themed menu. Performances of Disney Characters Parade starts around 14:30. Should come to the Main Street location a bit early in order to get a good position. The game ended in a fireworks show with background Casle Sleeping Beauty (if not mistaken). After completion of the entire event at Disneyland, no need to rush, many vehicles available, especially the Disney MTR available each less than 5 minutes. Enjoyable experience but not going here twice...","Neutral"
"This being the 20 th anniversary of the park or should it be the 20 th anniversary of no improvements.The park is showing signs of wear and needs some innovation , and something new.Apart from the parade during two days I was there I saw three characters, where were they ?Food was expensive and limited in the park.For the time of year queues were horrendous and the changeovers were slow.Frankly Legoland is nearer and better value, but without the Magic.","Negative"

"Now i am not quick in writing bad reviews, certainly not about Disneyland Paris where I come many times a year for years in a row; but i can't do anything else then mark the park as an Average this year. The park started to ban Selfie sticks ; now you may think a rand about that comes, but no; they are strict on this and will inform anyone using one they can't use it anymore. But that is now exactly what we expect of something else. And that is where the review is about (among some other smaller things).Disneyland is for us the same as a Children Kingdom; and we expect the park is suitable for children as well. The problem is, it is not ! Disneyland Paris lets their visitors smoke anywhere and everywhere, even in the queues of the attractions. This is not child friendly (count the times you have to pull your child away from someone almost putting their cigarette into their faces) or just the 2nd hand smoke. The official policy of the park is that there can only be smoked in the designated area's but nobody cares or takes action on it; not even if you ask employees to do something about it. But if someone makes a picture with a selfie stick they jump on them to scold them. So why is this not happening with the smoking policy ? Pointing the visitor who smokes to the designated areas is not so bad is it ? Of course we know the issue; on selfie sticks people do not get aggressive when asked to stop, while some smokers are going to be angry. But that should not be a reason not to enforce the rules, which are there for everyone and to make everyone happy. So Disney, please start enforcing the rules again ! The children will be happy you do ! And that is where the park lost the magic.Next to this it seems that this year Disney decided to close many attractions for refurbishment, great that the park gets an upgrade, but really you close  it's a small world  in the Peak of the holidays ? one of the few attractions young and old can enjoy. If you closed this after the peak of holidays i can understand but really we talk about July August here. Not to mention the large amount of other attractions being closed during the summer holiday period. Like Big Thunder Mountain going to be closed for nearly 2 years, and Space mountain (reopend at the time of writing) was closed for some time as well during the summer holidays. Also we saw a lot of Frozen commercials on TV; in the park you will not see anything, except a show, which was nice, just wondered why still a few where French speaking while we did go to the English show.Brings us to another point; the English shows are VERY limited; and you are lucky if they are not being cancelled after you waited for an hour (i.e. Stich live on stage) this did not happen to us once, but several times during the past years. I really hope Disney takes the time and effort to review this and see how they can make improvements for their 'not' French customers, paying a big bag of money to enjoy the magic which as someone else put it 'lost its sparkle'","Neutral"

"If you have never visited a Disney park ever, you may think that this is a great park. However for me who came here 17 years ago and who has done Florida twice and Disneyland California, this just felt a little tired and failed to live up to expectations.Not as many characters around for the youngsters to meet which meant that the ones available had longer queues. Also had instances where characters advertised as being available from a set time, then 10 mins later we would be told they need a break soon and will be back in 20 30 mins but you can simply wait in an already long queue, I found this unbelievable!! If they need a break after only 20 mins why can't they take on more staff to swap around?Across this park and the Walt Disney Studios, too many large rides shut for refurbishment which I think is unacceptable the amount they charge to stay here. Why more than two major rides being shut at one time is a mystery and feels to me that they simply take their customers for granted. What rides they have for the youngsters are good and this was a saving grace.Customer service generally received around the park is slow and at times rude. This again is another reason it just did not feel like Disney. I think when you take the park into account and the expense generally here in Euro Disney I would recommend people wait until they can raise extra funds and visit Disney World Florida instead.","Negative"
"I'm not pleased to have to report this but if you are planning a trip to Disneyland any time soon I would reconsider. Within one day of arriving home (March 2015) me and my 3 year old granddaughter became VERY SICK! Now the 14 month old is starting with fevers. I don't remember ever being this sick for this long and I'm not showing signs of turning a corner yet. As much as I love Disneyland it is definitely not worth going until they clean this place up. I had no idea they have been having problems for months with flu and measles. At the very least they should post a big warning at the front gate so visitors can take extra precautions if they choose to go in. Believe me, I have been so sick it is not worth it!! Usually I would give a rating of 5 but right now I would give them a 0. My rating of 1 is only because that is as low as trip advisor will let you rate. I cannot find any reports from Disneyland itself about this huge problem. They need to inform the public of what's happening within those happy walls and of how they are combatting it. Take my advise. I can't stress it enough, you don't want whatever it is I have and I'm positive I got it in either Disneyland or California Adventure!!!","Negative"
"We experienced ride closures on 5 occasions which totally spoilt our experience. Especially since we had queued for a long time on each occasion. The worst ride was the Indiana Jones which broke down on us twice ! On the first occasion, we were sitting in the car, in the first row, strapped in and ready to go. Then they announced a technical problem with the ride and we had to get off. what a waste of time and a really bad experience for my son.Bearing in mind this is the peak season, what are Disney playing at ??","Negative"
"I'm currently standing in an hour and a half long line just to get on Finding Nemo. If your favorite ride is Space Mountain, expect a two and a half hour wait. The amount of people that are allowed into the park is ridiculous. We have to follow lines to get from land to land. I use to come here every year up through high school, never have I experienced so many people at Disneyland. Eventhough this is  peak season,  I wish those who operate the park would care about the happiness of the visitors who pay over $100 a ticket versus their net profit. Disney, everyone standing in these lines and herding through the park look miserable. Please take this post to heart.","Negative"

"Awful park. Really let's Disney down. The staff are rude. The park is tacky, old and worn down. When we visited the Disney studios park, 8 rides attractions were closed or broken.

My two daughters were so disappointed!Good thing we waited for 1.5 hours (under the hot sun), to see Elsa and Anna   the show was very good though, but considering the time you waste under the hot sun just to go to a ride or a show is not worth with the price you paid to enter Disneyland!All guests are wet with sweat! It is very hot with very minimal shades and blowers! And the queues are hyterical!So many food stalls are closed and the few that are open closed down 2 hours early!And the staff, I think they need customer service training! It is a very hot place with very cold people!Hong Kong Disneyland is a joke! Walt Disney should consider removing his brand in this place!","Negative"

"Totally agree with a previous comment, we took our 4 year old granddaughter, had a 4 day pass and only used 2 because she didn't want to go back again. The lines are horrendous, out dated and so short for the 30 to 90 minute line up. The people are rude and obnoxious. Children wait in the heat while adults with so called fast passes get on kids rides first. We went to universal studio first and our 4 year old had a blast. The rides are 4D, graphics are fantastic and the commentary is brilliant, staff are friendly and helpful, and make sure that you feel welcome.","Negative"
"This is something to take into account as most of the attractions for kids 12  are not active at the moment.  Although the park is practically under major renovation ( including the park entry and ALL major attractions), they offer no discount to visitors.","Neutral"
"Visited here for the day on a recent trip to California. Families may find they need 2 days, but we arrived when the park opened and stayed close and found that enough time to do all the rides and see everything we wanted to see.As two adults with no children visiting disney and having been to Universal Studio's the day before, we found some of the rides not as exciting as we had hoped. However, everything else about Disney is very impressive! Each different area is very special, the rides are fun and the shops are quirky although slightly over priced! We also went to the museum with the A. Lincoln area which we found really good. The fireworks were amazing and if you miss staying to the end to see them you would miss out! Great day out!","Positive"
"GOOD STARTWe stayed at the Davy Crocket Ranch, a 15 min drive outside the park   a family of 5 in one of the 6  person 'premium' chalets.Superb hotel location off park, quiet, secure, clean, with parking right outside the chalet front door ; there's a lovely adventure playground together with a nice indoor swimming pool & restaurant   bar in the main complex, with many Disney characters wandering unexpectedly around. Great for the kids.We took a hotel park entry package, which was well worth the money   the 2 hour 'pre entry' to the park (included in the package) is a MUST if you want to avoid the inevitable queues later in the day. Once you hit 10.00 am, the general public enter the park and it's a football crowd !The 'fast pass' system for rides is great to avoid exxessive waiting later in the day (max we spent was 20 mins, when the 'real' queue was advised at 85 mins)   use it wisely and it will benefit you enormously and will save you hours (literally) of standing around with irritated kids. The various rides for our daughters' age ranges were loved by all, although the attractions are starting to show their age and are a little 'shabby' in places. I would have thought the management might have spent a little more on maintenance, but as the park is running at a EUR 78 million loss, then I guess they don't have the money ? Still ...BUTThe one thing that really got me was the food and drink in the park   it was over priced, very limited in scope and, basically, wasn't worth the paper plates on which it was served. You'd think that Disney, with France's 'super' food heritage, might have pushed the boat out a bit but NO   it was junk. Simple as that. Over priced junk ...My strong recommendation would be to bring your own snacks and drinks into the park (despite the airport style security at the gates)   eat outside for your main meals. When I say outside, I mean not at one of the restaurants right outside the park gates (for example, Planet Hollywood   over EUR 100 for a few plates of pasta and soft drinks for 5, thanks). You have been duly warned !The other thing that annoyed me most was the fact that smoking was allowed virtually everywhere   right outside the food locations (sometimes inside !), in the ride queues, and even on some of the rides themselves. If you are a non smoker, it can be rather sickening (literally) at times, with no thought at all being given to young children by the smokers themselves. A simple all park smoking ban would make the park a much more pleasant environment to be in, believe me.The overall attitude of the staff was a little odd   some obviously took their 'must be happy at all times' role seriously, being very attentive to our girls (who dressed for the occasion in their 'princess' costumes) ...others just couldn't care less, chatting amongst themselves and generally seeming to resent the public's presence (!). Don't they train these guys in PR ? Obvously not ...For meeting the characters, I must say it was a waste of time   we actually met more in our hotel than in the park. You might be luckier, I don't know. One time we queued for 20 mins to meet Mickey, only to have him ushered off right in front of our eyes to another location by the strong arm FBI style park security (complete with 'secret agent' ear pieces   what's that all about, anyway ?).All in all, i can summarise as follows :1. Nice hotel, good package2. Park was a little shabby and run down, plus needed a good clean, otherwise the rides were OK3. Food was extremely poor and vastly over priced4. Smoking was a real put off5. Meeting characters ... feeling lucky ?6. Lack of 'left luggage' lockers   where were they ?7. Extremely erratice customer service !Would I go again ? For me   No, for my daughters   Yes.","Neutral"
"Happy 60th Birthday Disneyland!This is my 3rd visit. Went for the 35th, 50th and now the 60th   Diamond Celebration.Did not disappoint. Lots has remained the same but also lots of added   new  rides . Everything was great. Had a fabulous time. Would go again tomorrow if I had the money and time.Mickey's Soundsational Parade was sensational; very colourful.Forever Fireworks Spectacular lit up the sky.Paint the Night Parade was unbelievably vibrant and truly spectacular   my favourite. It truly is the 'happiest place on earth'.Also, the original is the best. Have been to both Hong Kong and Paris Disney. Both good and enjoyed myself but Anaheim far surpasses them both.NEGATIVES: 1. It is getting expensive to go. Now passed the $AUD100 mark.2. 60th Birthday Souvenirs   not impressed. Did buy some; couldn't resist but disappointed. Pricing wasn't consistent. Things that I thought would be cheap, were expensive and vice versa. Ears with 60 on them were hideous; didn't see too many people with them. Diamond ears were a ridiculously high price. Resisted but succumbed on the last day. Lots of pins (obviously an American thing; not an Aussie thing) but very few magnets. Got a 2015 magnet but no 60th   diamond magnet made.","Positive"
"We love Disneyland and Walt Disney World and we're great admirers of Walt Disney so we really wanted to love this tour. Unfortunately, except for the visit to Walt's private apartment, it was surprisingly boring and not worth the time or the money. Perhaps it depends on the guide you get, but what we experienced wasn't much more than a 3 hour long walk through the park with stops at various points to listen to information everyone already knows or can easily find on line or in other sources. Most surprising was the guide's fake sounding and extremely annoying verbal style. Really, she seemed to be actually mocking the Disney style. She even shed a tear when telling us about Walt's passing, and then got smiley and told us to dry our tears as we walked to lunch. I guess she cries on cue every day. On the positive side, we did get to go on a few rides and saw the Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln show which is always moving. But we could have done this and much more on our own. The final insult was the  lunch  consisting of a dry sandwich, chips, and a cookie, set out for us at tiny tables in a hot sunny space wedged in behind the tour kiosk. We were so sorry to have wasted a precious 3 hours on this, not to mention a few hundred dollars. It's a real shame, because there's so much they can do to make this tour live up to its name. They need to put some of their famous creativity to work and make it a real tribute to their founder's genius. I would pay twice as much for a really good tour like that. I suggest the folks in charge of tour content at Disneyland take the Universal Studios VIP tour, to see how royally guests are treated there and how informative, creative, and fun a tour can be.","Neutral"
"We visited Disneyland on the 31st August with our 3 children age 7, 12 & 13 years old. We felt a little disappointed by our experience. We enjoyed some rides mainly Indiana Jones, cars, Toy Story, Star Wars. The Parade was a typical 'Disney' type experience with enthusiastic performers. Staff we came into contact with outside of the parade appeared somewhat lack lustre. Working from a script and of minimal help. The day we went the train which takes you around the park was not running, the Haunted House was shut and the Indiana Jones ride which we tried to go on again had  broken down  with no forthcoming information on when it would reopen. Some rides felt tired and stuck in a time warp. In order to compete with some other attractions Disney need to offer more than just rides and characters. It would be nice to have some educational type experience to learn more abut how animated films are made, the graphics, voice overs etc. There is only so long it can live off its reputation. Disney needs to inject some money into the park to bring back the magic. All in all for the money you pay if some rides experiences are going to be shut then you should not have to pay the full price. If you're deliberating between Universal studios and Disney Universal wins hands down.","Neutral"
"I was expecting a lot more from this place. We didn't get a chance to visit the studio but from what we heard from people who had been already, we didn't miss out on much.There are only three rollercoasters in the park, one of which was broken when we visited. Space Mountain was not fun at all, just a minute of trying not to hit your head off of the 'over the shoulder harness'. Most of the ride is spent in complete darkness, it is not entertaining at all. The other rollercoaster that was open (although not until the afternoon   it was having technical difficulties in the morning) was the Indiana Jones one, which was not worth waiting for. The drops last for less than a second, you barely have time to get excited before you start going up again.The saving graces of the park were the shops and the cars. I managed to get lots of souvenirs for friends and family, and quite a lot of sweets and chocolate for myself. The car ride was so much fun, my friends and I enjoyed it immensely (although I suppose it's because we kept rear ending each other, which you're not supposed to do).Lunch was pretty expensive.The shopkeepers are nice though, they let my friend and I sit in the corner of a shop for the last half hour we had to spend in the park, having gone on all the 'good' rides and bought things for everyone we needed to.I had a good time, but it most definitely was due to the fact I was having a laugh with my friends, not because Disneyland is great (because it certainly isn't).","Neutral"
"After visiting only the Walt Disney studios last time and being disappointment by only really having 2 food rides we decided to get combo ticket   well we were here for 12hrs!!! Longest we've ever stayed at an amusement park. With the heat being more bearable than the Orlando hear that comes with Disney USA we were able to flutter between 2 park and use the fast pass tickets (that are free) effectively!

"So, October half term...and off we went to Disneyland Paris with our 8yo and 9yo.First tip, once you get confirmation, ring Eurostar and pick your seats early.... try and get a table or make sure you   re facing forward or at least together.... Eurostar will choose for you but they can change it early so call them!!!Sequoia Lodge was a good base for our adventure. For me, Sante Fe and Cheyenne are a little too far away but sequoia Lodge or even hotel New York or Newport Bay are perfect with The Disney Village a 5 minute walk. Don   t expect much with the accommodation, but then you don   t spend long there as it is just a base to sleep. But it   s clean with beds made and towels changed daily so no complaints from us, and the kids swimming pool was an added bonus too!! Ok, so enter the Disney Village at 8... make your way to the main part of DLP and enter the parks showing your Magic Pass. Once in, head towards the area where Buzz Lightyear and Hyperspace mountain is. They open this area at 8.30am and you can get on these two rides, plus orbitron and Star Tours with no queue. It worked for us & each day and we certainly made the most of it!!! Autopia is another kids favourite that gets a crazy queue, so get there for 9.30 to get on early!! (Oh, and breakfast in cafe Hyperion opens at 8.30 too..... rides first, then breakfast!!). At about 9.45, send someone off to get fast passes for ratatouille or thunder mountain as they get crazy busy.... grab some lunch, watch a parade, meet a character..... (DO NOT QUEUE FOR SOMETHING THAT SHOWS OVER 45mins QUEUING..... it is not worth it!!).....A well deserved afternoon siesta about 4.30ish each day recharges batteries then off to dinner. TOP TIP: book restaurants before you go. There are some good restaurants included in the half board plan but they get booked up way in advance..... Annette   s is a walk in burger place which did a job. The buffet at Sequoia Lodge restaurant and Cape Cod restaurant at Newport Bay are good..... but we were completely oblivious to just how far in advance you have to book for Cafe Mickey or Jack   s Pirates restaurant. You have been warned!! After dinner, head back to Disney Studio. Queues for Rockin Roller Coaster, RC Racer, Hollywood Tower are all lower..... particularly at about 7.30pm, half hour before closing... we did ratatouille three times back to back!!! At 8pm Head back to the main Disney park for a low queue Pirates of the Caribbean trip.... plus any others whilst keeping your eye on the ride waiting times on the magipark App (there   s another top tip right there!).....And at least one night stay up for the illuminations, it is breathtaking!!!Obviously stuff is expensive, but you have to be prepped for that and go with the flow (   7 for a small popcorn,    4 for a bottle of coke as an example)..... if getting character photos, the staff will take pictures on your phone for you so you don   t have to pay the extortionate price for their photos..... It is(& was for us) an amazing place to go. It   s clean, friendly and so much going on it   s hard not to have the best holiday ever. Rides get ridiculously busy, so do them in your magic hours that you get for staying in a Disney hotel, make the most of your fast pass which you get for staying in a Disney hotel & always go back in the evening when queues are lower!!! And lastly, get some Mickey ears and enjoy yourselves!!!!","Positive"

"Don't get me wrong. I love Disney. I've been a pass holder at Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California for years. I've been to Disney in Orlando, Florida on two occasions and think it's great. My daughter and I spent two days at Disneyland Paris this past July. We couldn't wait to go there. When we first got there, we were hungry. Using the guide that's provided, we started looking for places to eat. We walked around and around going to four different restaurants that were closed! I was astounded. We finally saw a sign indicating which restaurants were open that day. We went to the closest restaurant and it was mobbed. After waiting over an hour to order we finally ate. After eating, we waited in line for Space Mountain and the ride closed down as we got near the front of the line. Then the same thing happened on Pirates of the Caribbean. Then when we went on the Haunted House the ride broke down numerous until we got to the end. It was so bad we both thought it was hilarious and had a good laugh! We trekked over to the Indiana Jones ride which looked great on the guide, but it was closed for refurbishment. We did a few things and had a good time, but the operation did not seem to be as well run as the Anaheim and Orlando parks. However, it is Disney and still very enjoyable. When we finally went on Space Mountain it was a very thrilling ride, much more so than in the US. Some of the food options at the park were very good. Despite everything we had an enjoyable time. We went back the next day to Disneyland Park again and to the Walt Disney Studios Park. Generally speaking, many things were up to Disney standards, such as overall upkeep and clean bathrooms. It was particularly fun to see some of the attractions in French, such as Star Tours. If you're at all planning on going to Disneyland Paris, I would rate it is a must do attraction despite any flaws there may be. After all, it is Disney but with slightly less magic than we've previously experienced. You have to do it at least once!","Neutral"

The employees at the Disneyland Resort were just okay...nothing exceptional.The accommodations were just okay. I was really hoping to feel the  Magic  but it wasn't there. The hotel is okay, but certainly not worth what they are charging. We saw off site hotels that were just as nice for a fraction of the cost. There was mold in the bathroom tile and the sofa was worn. The list goes on, but why bother. I have extreme  buyers remorse  and just didn't feel that the money I paid for 4 nights was worth it, just to say I stayed at a  Disney Hotel . I will save my money in the future and stay off site where they offer free shuttles to the parks.","Neutral"

"Decided to do HKG disney as last minute decision...Park is small.. as per all the other reviews   spent maybe a good 4 hours here. Space mountain is all star wars themed at the moment. Mystic point which is a purely built for HKG was amazing   such a unique attraction and made it worth visiting the park.. Favourite ride was the runaway mine cart ( this also had a single rider line   maybe the only one in the park??) If looking for disney stuff in the shops, don't hold your breath too much... its not 'disney' disney in terms of heaps of mickey and donald and goofy etc.. had more zootopia, big hero 6 and other disney toys . Which made it feel more like a giant toy shop than a disney store.   had your t shirts and mugs as well though.Didnt really see any characters around the park, Did see MIckey as was exiting at main square though... wasnt really looking, but wasn't really advertised either.All in all   was glad I went, but wouldnt go to this park again. They need at least another 3 lands and more than 1 main rider per land to make it great.","Neutral"
"I feel a little unfair giving this place only a    3 star    rating. I   ve been to WDW 6 times, the missus has been to WDW 19 times and we tried to enjoy Disneyland Paris for what it is, but couldn   t. There wasn   t the same magic, the same atmosphere or the same sensation walking around WDW in Florida gives me or the missus for that matter. We were initially very excited to be going but after an hour the excitement dwindled and it was just like being at any other theme park. Don   t get me wrong, we did enjoy our time there and the rides we went on, but it just lacked something we enjoy about FL. I   ve found a number of the    cast members    to be rude and abrupt, the smiles on the faces of their Floridian counterparts weren   t there, the happy smiling, Mickey Glove waving cast members that they are weren   t to be seen amongst the French cast members. On the plus side, I got to go on the Peter Pan ride here as the queue for that in WDW is usually 90mins plus.The food is overpriced   and some! But on the plus side, the food is vastly superior to food in WDW, but still needlessly overpriced. The coffee cup size you get for    3.69 is not even what I   d consider    small    and for the first time in my life, I didn   t have the    ump when it was time to come home. I enjoyed the    steampunk    look to Discoveryland (where Tomorrowland is in WDW) and walking through the Nautilus was very interesting. I will return, but I   m in no rush to do so.","Neutral"

"Do not get my title wrong as I have been a lifelong fan of Disney parks. I have have traveled to the Orlando and California locations more times than I want to admit.But Disneyland was hot, with huge crowds, lines and crying kids. The Disney cast were as usual on top of their games.The park itself is small compared to the Magic Kingdom in Orlando and the castle seems rather small in comparison. It seems that they are renovating the park with a lot of construction on going so maybe my comments are unfair.I do like the Fastpass system to at least get you on a few rides that you may enjoy.The Light Parade is going in to retirement I heard, so if you are interested, get there before August 20. The fireworks and show are still incredible.I would love to visit again in a couple of years to see the park that they have re created.","Neutral"

"Having been to the Disney parks in Florida we have always been keen to find out what the Paris ones were like.Out of the 2 parks there is far more to do in the Disneyland Park and at some of the places you could almost be in Florida. The rides were good and the parks were well kept and while we were there is was 30 degrees so it really did feel like Florida.I would advise that is staying in a Disney hotel to take advantage of the extra hours on the Disneyland park as we tried in Walt Disney Studios but they did not open their gates until 10.00 and then it was a mad scramble for Crush's Coaster which in view of the hype was actually quite disappointing.Be prepared for people pushing and shoving and smoking everywhere, the cost of food and drink is extortionate so have plenty of Euros ready. We enjoyed some of the set meals in the parks fast food restaurants we shared platters that cost    12 and found there was plenty to eat for lunch and in the evenings we ate in Disney village. The best was the Rainforest cafe which at    20 was not cheap but worth it for the good food and experience, Annettes diner served good burgers but they were vastly overpriced but then Disney has the monopoly.We were there for 3 days and felt it just enough to do the parks and rides, it was expensive but good and we hope to go again one day.","Positive"
"It is Disneyland and the many rides and attractions are always a hit with young children and we had a good time at the park with them. Disappointed the Matterhorn, Pirates of the Caribbean and the Disney train were all out of service at the same time for repair. All ate icons at Disneyland and to have so many out at the same time was a disappointment. We also had a fast pass to Space Mountain and showed up at the designated time and were turn away due to a malfunction of some type. Came back up a couple of hours later. We did enjoy the day but we were very disappointed some much was out of commission.","Neutral"
"We have just returned from a wonderful trip to Eurodisney. Travelled with my husband & 2 kids aged 8 & 6. Can't fault a thing. Everyone was really pleasant & helpful without the sugary sweetness that can sometimes be the American way. The best trick is to approach people with a smile & you will always get the best from them. Pre booking the restaurants with the concierge was brilliant & we never experienced any waiting times. Walt's, the Steakhouse & the Silver Spur were all excellent.The rides were great & we managed to avoid too many lengthy queues. The magic hours worked well & the occassional fast pass was a life saver! We tended to start out early in the morning, stay at the park until early afternoon, recharge our batteries by the pool, and then continue on with the rides after dinner. The queues were generally much shorter from 9pm onwards. Definitely the magical experience we were hoping for!","Positive"
"i wanted to write this review to help other to be able to afford to go to disneyland.i have found the most enexpensive place to stay is the best western park place inn and mini suites.1.i think they are the most inexpensive one 2. they are rated well3. they are located just a 5 min. walk from the hotel to the disneyland and california adventure park entrances so you can return to you room anytime during the day to rest , eat ,ect.4. no parking fees5.they are located next to inexpensive restaurants such as mcdonalds and i hop.6.they have a pretty good free continental breakfast upstairs although im not so sure about the restaurant downstairs from reviews.7. their rooms and service are good.to save money ,i have seen people bring some snacks for small children in the park ie sandwiches ect. in a backpack, but no large meals like in coolers. you can buy your own food and make it it you hotel room, park place has a microwave and small fridge.in your hotel, at no charge.you can bring your own water bottles and fill them up during the day in the park. i think the least crowded times for disneyland are sept. after labor day ,oct. except for the first week which has a special interest group going there, and utahs uea convention around the 16 and 17,you can go on mouseplanet to get more info about times to avoid., and i check the anaheim convention center website for any large conventions.,you can also go to some of the hotel websites which can already show sold out days way in advance to let you know how busy the park will be.we spend at least 1 day just at one of the beaches which is fun and inexpensive.if you want to go for 3 day parkhopper pass to disneyland, 1 day universal studios, 1 day seaworld, 1 day sandeigo zoo, for what i think is the most inexpensive, try the southern california city pass , it is available at costco for a real deal.","Positive"

Tired theming which needs the magic putting back in.Use of hoarding to hide closed refurb attractions   very un Disney.Food quality acceptable but not out of this world.Range of food outlets is odd and very little in the way of traditional indoor coffee shops, it's not very pleasant collecting a machine dispensed coffee from the cashier in the gift shop.Very little indoor seating which for Paris is necessary.Essentially it's just Alton Towers with less emphasis on good customer service and the audacity to use the iconic Disney name and brands.","Negative"
"You hear   'you can do that in a day' , 'it's not as good as Anaheim' , 'it's quite small'   well to those naysayers, myself, my wife and nearly 3 year old daughter from Melbourne, Australia absolutely loved Hong Kong Disneyland. Yes it was our first 'family Disneyland' experience. My wife had been to Anaheim before, however we both agreed that Hong Kong Disney was as good if not better than the original. We got there and went straight to fantasyland, as that is where you will see all the original Disney characters, along with the famous teacups and Disney carousel. We had photos with Winnie the poo, mickey, Minnie and sleeping beauty. We had purchased a two day pass which was well worth it as we stayed in the park from 10 until 3pm on the first day, we came back to see the unmissable fireworks at 9pm, (an absolute must do). We felt we did not need to rush through the entire park as on the second day we spent most of the time in adventureland, watching lion king show and riding the minecars. Food is well priced and on par with what you get outside of the resort. A tip, it's a little cheaper to eat outdoors and not in the food halls (can add up for a family). It was 35 degrees both days we were there, with 98% humidity, so take plenty of water and sunscreen in the summer months as there is not a lot of cover from the heat. Perhaps an umbrella would come in handy to get you away from the heat. We had our daughter in her pram, we took our own, but you can hire them at the resort. The park is pram friendly. Overall, a magical experience, which was highlighted as we also stayed at the disney's Hollywood hotel, 2 mins bus ride from the park. A must do for families in Hong Kong, or even on the way elsewhere.","Positive"
"Be sure and get Fast Passes for popular rides.  Saves a lot of time.  Lots of good places to eat.  Entire park is very clean and family friendly.","Positive"
"It   s no longer the happiest place in earth but has become the slowest place on earth. Arriving by car you get the pleasure of paying $20 for parking that between the wait getting in the parking structure and fighting the crowd to get in a team takes at least an hour. Most rides take near to an hour to wait or get a fast pass and come back in 2 hours or more. While waiting for the fast pass you can   t get another. If you manage to get on a ride it lasts about 5 minutes. Spend a day there and maybe get on 4 or 5 rides. Not worth the money or time unless you   ve never been there and even then not sure it is.","Negative"
"We visited Disneyland at half term May and had an absolutely amazing time. All the rides, from the rollercoasters to the sweet Fantasia land fairy tale rides, we loved every bit of it. Had the most wonderful family holiday and my children, age 9 and 12 were both very happy!","Positive"
"My two daughters waited to get jack sparrows autograph over by the blue bayou we asked the lady who was walking with him if he dose autographs she said yes if you ask nicely my 6 and 8 year old asked please 3 different times, he then told them if they didn't want to take a picture they needed to shoe them started a count down from 5 ..... my daughter ran to me crying saying how mean he was, I understand the need to play the roll of a a hole but to treat kids in that manner is just wrong. All the other characters were very nice and wonderful.","Negative"
"What a terrible disappointment. We chose to spend our last day at Disney Paris   what a bad decision.The ONLy good part was the parade   it was exceptional.EVERYTHING else was disgraceful and a complete rip off.Many of the rides and restaurants were closed, which resulted in long queues everywhere...we waited for an average of 45 minutes per ride   VERY frustrating for kids aged 7 and 9...and really annoying for parents.Honestly, waiting for almost an hour for a 5 minute ride is NOT okay.What do they allow so many thousands of people in when the facilities available cannot cope.This is just ridiculous in the middle of summer, high season.....why don't they refurbish their attractions in winter when there are less people visiting?Totally ridiculous.We had to queue for a cool drink, pop corn and all the food and the prices were exhorbitant and the food was atrocious.Overall it was just a shabby money making scheme, riding on the back of the Disney label,We STRONGLY advise anyone visiting Paris to just avoid this awful experience. Coming from Cape Town, South Africa...our local amusement park is significantly better....on every level.We loved Paris but truly regret the time and money spent here.AVOID.","Negative"
"If you have been to Disney world in Florida you will be a bit underwhelmed by this park,much smaller and not as well maintained and not kept as litter free.many rides were shut for refurbishment till next year.worth making the most of your 2 magic hours if you are staying in a Disney hotel,very small queues if any.weekends are a nightmare for queuing and trying to get food to eat in the restaurants in the park,don't bother.also not worth getting a photo pass as most of the time we had to take our own photos as when we met the characters there was no official photographer .the parade was good and also the fireworks and laser show was very good.we went for 6 nights and we ran out of things to do so would suggest going for a shorter holiday.would go again but not at the weekend.","Neutral"
"The park was overcrowded and the lines very long,  we were offered early entry with our Disney hotel package.  But when we arrived early most of the rides & attractions were closed and some entire sections of the park were blocked to entry.","Neutral"
"Crowded on Christmas Day.   Would go 12 23 24 if I were to go again.  Long lines, but consider FAST Track.   Food was very expensive.   Take along your own snacks.   Rented a stroller.  Helps little ones when they get tired of walking and standing.","Positive"
"I know there are a million reviews of Disneyland, so I will be brief. If you are going to go to Disneyland, Ocotober is the time to go! Firstly, the entire park is decorated for Halloween, and the decorations are awesome. There are loads of places to take family picyures in front of giant pumpkins and fall decor. Also, the Haunted Mansion is completely done up and very cool to see.I'd say the biggest bonus is the crowds are minimal compared to any other time of year. We went to the park in the morning, Fast Passed our way through the popular rides, and managed to do just about everything in 11 hours. The Fast Pass is a must in any case, but we literally breezed through Pirates of The Carribean as well as Splash Mountain.Our only disappointment was California Adventure. Be advised that the giant lake the is central to the park is completey drained for renovation. They are constructing what looks to be a new light show on water. I am sure it will be amazing when it's done, but it's rather unsightly now and takes away from the ambience a bit. Also, the park closed at 6pm with no warning for an event. We had barely gotten there, and we had to leave. Pretty disappointing.But, who can get upset in the Happiest Place On Earth! :) We still had time to go back to Disney and shop the Disney District. If your kids are tired, go to the Mexican Restaurant in the District (by House of Blues), sit on the balcony and watch the Disney fireworks while you eat dinner. The kids love this, and they have their own balloon artist who will creat any sort of animal you request. Very fun!","Positive"
"This was our first experience of Disney and we absolutely loved it. Although We originally thought it would be more character based and less theme park we actually really loved the theme parks in particular Peter Pan ride, Buzz laser blast and Star Tours and Ratatouille.We thoroughly enjoyed the parades and especially the loved the illuminations which were magical for our young children and what we imagined Disney to be about.Two minor things, the constant queuing gets tiring as with any theme park so if you can afford to upgrade to fast pass it   s worth it. Also some of the staff in the shops were rude which was not quite the Disney experience we expected however don   t let that detract from going but it   s good to be prepared for it so it doesn   t upset your trip.","Positive"
"Enjoyed our 3rd Tinker Bell Half Marathon and our visit at California adventure and Disneyland.  The half marathon was very well organized and a great event to be part of.","Positive"
"Our family had so much fun. The park was not as crowded as it could have been. Only downside was that some of the attractions were closed.","Positive"
"Worth a visit but  two days maybe needed to see everything. For a tourist spot food and drinks not to pricey.","Neutral"
"After this last visit I wonder if it's really worth $125 day to... 1) wait for hours on end to enjoy a 45 second ride2) spend time in the queue for everything from going to the washroom to grabbing a 'meal' to paying for your souvenirs. You gotta line up and wait for EVERYTHING. 3) Overpriced   from the funnel cakes, drinks and the ice cream bars to the poorly prepared and pathetically presented 'meals' in dangerously over crowded restaurants to the key chains mugs t shirts stuffed plushies (which by the way you could pick up at the ABC store less than a block from the maingate for mere pennies   same stuff), it's all over priced. 4)Crowded crowded crowded   can't find a seat in the 'restaurants', can't find a spot to watch the parades, can't find a spot to sit and watch the water show(even after being directed to a specific spot by an employee   only to be told later by another employee that we couldn't sit there   we were then directed to sit behind this bush over here that's partially blocked by that garbage can which of course is hidden behind that fence which is then blocked by 10,000 people)   we ended up just hopping into the queue to get out of this place and watched an ad for the watershow on our hotel Disney channel. So...in a nutshell, not the best experience. Went with some older family members this time and were completely disappointed and frustrated. No character's running about like before. The parades had less floats than before. The addition of the watershow only turned into a huge disappointment. Thankfully when we were there last time with young family members, we got to see Mickey, Minnie, Goofy(even though the niece was terrified of him), Max, princesses...the parade was totally worth the wait then. I'm just glad that this time it was only adults who were able to live with the disappointments.A word of advice to those families out there who are planning a trip to LA to do the Disney thing. Come in February or November. Take your kids out of school and avoid the peak season. Cheaper to fly to LA, cheaper for hotels, no ridiculous lines queues crowds. It may be worth the outrageous prices if there aren't those things to worry about.After all was said and done, we were joking that for an extra 10$ a night we could have got a parkside room and watched the fireworks nightly from the room and saved on the park fee, especially since the best view of the new watershow was looping on the hotel's Disney channel endlessly day in day out. So, paying $125 for a day of waiting...waiting...waiting...and waiting, only be just so frustrated that we left the park early. Is it worth it???","Negative"
"Don't get me wrong: I love Disney! And one of my travelling companions will wring my neck when she sees that I have given something less than five stars. Still it is my review to offer, and my opinion is that Disney Parks trade on a specific brand of nostalgic Americana that is just monstrously out of place outside the US. I had fun at Disney Paris, but at the same time I was sad to have virtually no obvious European content ... except beer and wine at meals. I just could not settle into the concept.I will say the old  E Ticket  rides are very up to snuff here. Pirates, Haunted House, Space Mountain are in glorious form, and  It's a Small World  is as delightfulas ever. Lines were generally short   it was pouring rain, but also a holiday. Train from Paris was even, but train service back was too little: a lot of us waited nearly 40 minutes for a return train, and lots of people stood the 40 minutes back to central Paris.","Neutral"

"Overall we liked the park and thought it was cleanSome rides have long waiting times and in 36oC heat this is not funFood at Santa Fe was highly recommended but would of expected more from Plaza Gardens$15.00 for three small glasses of coke..absolute rip off$3.50 for a bottle of water..seriously Disney sort your prices out Light show fireworks was amazing but you had to pitch up an hour before to get a good spot to see themStaff very rude and unhelpful..got fed up with their attitude..Very pretty park but wish I'd of spent my money on a two day break at Legoland UkMake sure you have lots of spending, prepared to wait in long queues & be met by nothing but rude staff...","Neutral"
"A trip of a lifetime for our 6 year old daughter. She did not stop from entering the park at 8 a.m till we left after 10 p.m. Plenty of rides and attractions to fill more than one day there. Will have to go back there some day.","Positive"
"We bought the Southern California Citypass from San Diego Sea World as that's our first stop. However we had problems entering Disneyland as apparently we should have a separate citypass card that the staff at Sea World forgotten to issue us. How would we know? We were tourists and we did check with the Sea World staff when we made the purchase. The Disneyland staff were not helpful in assisting us and ridiculously wanted us to return to San Diego Sea World to collect the pass! We just arrived at Anaheim after a few hours drive from San Diego. We are definitely not spoiling our plans and driving back for the pass! We were not expecting this kind of service from the supposedly  magical disneyland . First impression was really poor. Luckily we had the receipt with us and we insisted to speak to the supervisor for some assistance. The entrance staff called another staff who was again not helpful at all! They again insisted that we could not enter the park and we had to return to Sea World to retrieve the pass. Gosh.... I can't believe i'm at disneyland. After explaining for a few minutes they agreed to bring us to the ticketing counter whom they think might be able to help us. They should have saved the trouble and brought us there in the first place!!Finally we spoke to the ticketing supervisor and he emphatise with our situation and took our receipt and issued us with the  correct  citypass that we were supposed to be issued. He even promised that he will take care of everything such that our next stop to universal studios hollywood would be hassle free. We were so relieved that everything was resolved!We finally managed to enter Disneyland and spent 3 days at the park. Enjoyed the rides and some performances. It was pretty crowded and we had to queue around 40 mins for the more popular rides. We also went to the Halloween night party. The fireworks was pretty awesome and we lug back lots of candies and chocolates. Other than that, nothing special for us as we went in the day time... the rides and characters were pretty much the same as those you see in the day.","Neutral"
"Having done Disneyland Florida in 1981 as a 6 yr old, the intention was to take our 2 8yr olds before they were too old, to Euro Disney.....to take in the magic.Well, having checked into great accommodation courtesy of Centreparcs Village Nature a 30 bus ride away, we started the first of two days with Disney.Weather doesn   t bother us and we are pretty travel aware having been to many countries. However, the queues in this place were unreal. You expect to wait to get in ...everyone is likely to arrive as it opens etc. Its the rides...on the first day we managed 3 rides between 10am and 5 pm. 3 rides ...of which we queued for one for 2 hours. Normally, we would have just left but the children were there and once you commit to the wait, you are just too angry to leave the queue. That ride lasted 2.16 minutes ! More fool us. Food and drink onsite is costly and most bring their own. There are not loads of places to sit and eat it   most multi task whilst standing in the queues. Most staff were helpful apart from one who would not replace a broken pin badge fastening for my son who had owned it 30 minutes. No replacement fastener or offer of a refund just a non chalant    you buy another    . It   s a badge ffs, just take one off another badge and give us it   however, that staff member was not the norm   most were fine. Disney is obviously a huge enterprise, shops galore, over priced tat mostly unless you are die hard Disney of which we saw many. However, we wanted to do the old fashioned getting autographs of characters, meet characters for photos and there was very little of this. In two days in two parks we found one Goofy...both kids dissapppinted.In fact, far from being a memorable experience, both kids on the second day asked to go back to the village Nature accommodation to use the Centreparcs facilities.If we divided the cost of Disney between the rides we managed to get on (3 on day one, 5 on day two) then we have been sorely wripped off.","Negative"

"This was our fifteenth visit to Disneyland Paris and were looking forward to it as always. The main issue is that the park is undergoing lots of renovations. On one day there were only three rides open in Tomorrowland. The gardens were also a little overgrown. The water on the small world ride was not clean, paint work was peeling off and the flower beds had weeds taller than the flowers.There also seemed to be reliability issues with the rides Big Thunder Mountain a major attraction was broken more than four times a day. Crushes Coaster also had issues.We still had fun but I think they need to slow the speed of the renovations down finish one thing before starting the next or reduce the price of the tickets during this time.","Neutral"
"Visited Disneyland on mid term we were expecting less people as it was still cold. However queues were very long. We waited nearly 2 hours for some rides. Food is very expensive and so is all the toys and accessories in Disney shops. Disneyvtrain ride was a bit boring but we loved pirates of the carribean ride on water. There were long queues even for taking pictures with Minnie etc. And kids were not impressed with it. We spent most of our time queuing.","Neutral"
"As seniors we paid only 100HKD admistson and we thoroughly enjoyed our day there. We love  It's a Small World  and did that twice. The area set up for that is even nicer than at Disney USA. The only show that was presented,  The Golden Mickeys,  was quite good. The 3 D move  Mickey's PhilharMacgic   was also great. We did go on some of the other less wild rides. We had lunch at the Starlite Diner restaurant in Tomorrowland and it was surprisingly good and reasonably priced for the chicken with rice dish with soda. The Flights of Fancy parade at 3:30 was well done. The shops were full of Disney things and we couldn't resist. It was an easy park to navigate and one we did enjoy.","Positive"
"My Niece named this park the best and the happiest place on earth. She just enjoyed every minute of our visit, even though she go there at least 3 or 4 times a year. Every time a family member visit them from overseas ,there's always a trip to Disneyland. Its my first time to visit, and its an absolute magical experience. We spent the whole day, walking around around and having so much fun. Its not enough for the day, we have to come again. The Fantasyland ridesis so good, its just unbelievable. We waited till the parade and the atmosphere is so euphoric,justwatching the world Disney characters is awesome.","Positive"
"extremely disappointing. Many of the main rides closed and a few more broke while we were there. No Disney spirit, very few characters, dirty and very tired. Staff did not want to be there very miserable Don't take the Disney bus from the airport, very expensive and lied about the time it takes to get to Disney just go get the TGV train which is 10 mins instead of 1.5 hoursI love Disney USA but would never return to Eurodisney","Negative"
"This was our third visit to Disneyland Paris. We travelled with 2 children aged 7 and 11. The park opened at 10 am. We arrived about 9.00 am as the park opened at 10 am. We had pre booked tickets, booked through the disney website, you print the tickets at home which saves about 15% on gate prices per ticket. We booked a one day, 2 park hopper. Only draw back with this is you have to take your passport as id. We qued at the gates from 9.15 and we're allowed into the park from 9.30 am, however access points to areas were still blocked off except to the people that had the additional 2 hours in the park if staying at disney hotels. The biggest tip I would give is to print the park map before you go and plan out which rides you really want to go on and do these first. We went on Star Tours which our 7 year old loved, (I wouldn't rate) Pirates of the Caribean was great, Phantom Manor was great and ITopia. We did want to go on Thunder Mountain but the que for this ride was always at least 60 minutes and this particular area was always very busy.We preferred the rides etc in Walt Studios. I think that the disney park is better if travelling with younger children especially little girls who love the disney princesses. The parade was very good. People were getting into their position about 1   2 hours before the start of the parade!We only visited the parks for one day before heading off to central Paris but one day was more than enough for us. Although we had a great time, all the queing and peoples rudeness was too much for me and I couldn't have done anymore than one day.","Neutral"
"This is the second time I visit this wonderland since 2005. Frankly to say there is not much progress in the park. I pay my visit to Disney in the world many times(from FL LA TOKYO PARIS), this is the least park i would like to go again! Something is missing in this park! which belongs to Disney and Mickey!BTW, Please learn to line up before play!","Negative"
"We were not happy to find out that the Haunted Mansion was on repair, also Mickey was not home, and it was probably one of the hottests days in the season. But stll getting in the Space Mountain ride is just as exciting as when I was 16 and the fireworks at night still make my eyes watery.Make sure before you plan your trip that you are aware of the undergoing repairs, weather and plan ahead with your friends or family where would you like to go as priority. Dont forget to give yourself time to sit at least 1 and a half hour before the night parade as it continues being one of the highlights.The downside is how frustrating it is to find out that nowadays you have a restricted line to get photos with your favorite characters, as a matter of fact I didn  t see one single princess that day.","Positive"
"After flipping the $300.00 for two adults and two kids (after military discount), the parking was $15.00 although we parked way off sight and were bused (not shuttled in). Burgers for four with drinks came out to just under $50.00, and microwave pasta dinners were just under $50.00 as well. Forget souvenirs, toys, or mementos... the idea of spending easily $500.00 in one day at a theme park is amazing. My opinion is to invest that money into a Carnival Cruise where at least for a little more you'll have 5 7 days of enjoyment with your family and the food will be included.","Neutral"

"We re entered the park around 9pm for the fireworks. Afterward they had the entire street and one side walk roped off for people leaving the park. People entering only had the right sidewalk (Lincoln Memorial Side) and it just wasn't enough room. Once we got to the middle section near the castle all hell broke loose. We had our 6 month old in the stoller and our two year old riding but standing on an attachment board. My wife and I were walking. People were walking in all directions and were acting very rude. Nobody said excuse me, etc. Many people cut infront of my stroller, etc. When we finally cut across to Adventureland near the tiki room and were headed to New Orleans square things just stopped all together. I guess people were lining up for the Fantasmic Show, but I just wanted to take my boy to the Pirates of the Carribean and the Haunted House. This was nearly impossible and I began to loose my patience. Later after we disembarked from the Pirates of the Carribean, they had my stroller roped off for the Fantasmic and told me I would have to wait 45 minutes to have access to my stoller? REALLY? This is when I decided to just act like all of the other nutballs and I just went over the bridge and around next to the restaurant and grabbed my stroller. We bought some popcorn and avoid the crazy crowds by cutting though the park by the train near the haunted house. We then went on the trainride and the haunted house. After the fantasmic crowd left we had Disneyland to ourselves. We lost at least an hour do to the poor crowd control employed by Disneyland. Please send us some more tickets!","Negative"
"The size of this park is tiny, definitely not worth the high entry fee! It's iconic and that's probably why it stays afloat. The Star Wars addition was ok, I thought it would have more then one movie, one museum, and one ride. It advertised it was much bigger. Hyper Space mountain was a ride we all enjoyed. Just very disappointed in the amount of thrill rides this park had. Very minimal, should be better then what it was for the $100 admission per person. The rides are comparable to a county fair! Definitely needs a facelift! The fireworks were cancelled last minute due to the wind? What wind??! A local & an employee advised this happens often! Probably a slick way for Disney to save some money! Disappointing to folks like me , who don't get out to California. This was a once in a lifetime thing. I'll be back to Cali def not to Disneyland! Utter disappointment for my family. My kids were looking forward to it, but they were not happy at the end of the day. Shame on you Mickey!","Negative"
"This was my first time to a Disneyland of any type. I am from Australia, so the best thing we have is Dreamworld or Seaworld. Disneyland was so much better than I had expected. To be honest, I cannot comment on the price of entry, as my trip was paid for by someone else. I was also provided with a fast pass ticket, which again, I did not pay for, but would highly recommend people to get one. It lasts for one day only, so I used it to go on all of the fast pass rides in one day, and then used the next 3 days to visit all of the other rides. Tip  If you stay at one of the Disney hotels, you can enter the park at 8am, and the lines aren't any where near as big. But otherwise, the lines were pretty long and tedious...there were sometimes lines for up to 90 minutes...which is a bit ridiculous I think.I really enjoyed my experience here...I purchased souveniers for my family back in Australia, and spent over 200 Euro's which was pretty costly, considering I really didn't buy alot...but I didn't mind as I had not paid for anything else for the 4 days I was here... including food, which I did notice at some places was very expensive, and to be honest the quality was not the best. I suggest to pack a home made lunch, you will be thankful you did. At 29 years old, I felt like a kid again....The lights, characters, shows and rides were suitable for children and adults alike. Even I was excited to get my photo with some of the Disney Characters. The rides were also good, enjoyable and suitable for most ages. I only came across 2 rides with height restrictions... but most were suitable for families. I am a larger woman, so was a bit worried about fitting into the rides, as I had problems a few years ago in a theme park in Australia, but was so happy that I had not one problem on the rides here. As the rides were suitable for most, the harness seatbelt lap bar, were all pretty loose anyway. I saw people bigger than me going on rides as well, and no one seemed to have any problems. My visit to the park was at halloween, so we entered the park that evening for the halloween night. It cost extra...i think, and was great to see other tourists and staff all dressed up in halloween costumes. The staff were really good, and this would be suitable again for children and adults, provided the children are ok seeing other tourists dressed up as vampires and cannibals. :DI should also add that the toilets were clean at all times, at each different location I entered. There is also  stroller  rental, which are big enough for the whole family to use...I did see a grown man being pushed in one. lol. I don't know how much they cost...but it was a good idea. Both parks were lots of fun...and I can't wait to go back again next year!!!!","Positive"

"Hong Kong Disneyland was fantastic. It was very easy to get to via the subway and when we were leaving there was staff at the station to help with change & directions. We arrived at lunchtime and stayed until the fireworks display. The park was big enough for a full days worth of fun, but also small enough to get around it all in a day and to get on all the rides. We ate in the food hall which had a good selection of foods. We went mid week and the crowds weren't too big, the line up to rides and photos with the characters didn't take too long to get through. Toy story land was our favourite. The rides there were great fun.","Positive"

Disneyland is becoming overcrowded, due to its popularity After paying a $110USD entry fee, I gave up trying to go on any rides due to the excessive wait times of around 1 hour. Sadly I stayed only for 4 hours.Frontierland was my favourite.","Neutral"
"I have been to Disneyland Paris quite a few times. The first time was in 1992 when it first opened.Back in '92 It was expensive but well organised and the staff in general were polite and helpful. They had a happy and friendly disposition which you would expect from a theme park.I am sad to say that the original park has deteriorated and in need of a make over. The restaurants and rides are generally unresourced which makes the whole experience painful.You would for example not expect there to be long queues just to get into a restaurant. We pre booked all of our restaurants but still had to queue to get in. A 1:00 pm reservation turned out to be an actual 1:35 get into the restaurant followed by slow service. This was more a staffing issue (presumably to save money)I was also disappointed by the number of rides being refurbished. When you pay   50 00 to get in to a park, you expect to see all of it, not 85%. but at least they are refurbishing the place as it does look tired. Closed rides included space mountain, the Jules Vernes experience, etc. Some rides were closed due to technical reasons including the Aerosmith ride and thunder mountain. (I thnk some serious maintenance is required)So what else can be done to improve the experience?Add a few benches for people to sit on. There are very few places to sit, especially if you are wobbly on your legs.Fit better signage. You can spend quite a while finding things. A few extra well placed signs would go a long way.(signs in English, German, Italian, Spanish etc would not go amiss)Transport.Getting from the 'charles de gaulle' airport was a nightmare. The airport is very large and poorly signed. We laned at terminal 2 and had a train journey from the terminal to our baggage carousel. A journey of 20 30 mins. None of this was explained and we found the staff ignorant and rude.The actual bus transfer from the airport to the resort was also an experience. The driver spoke no english despte the fact that all passengers were from england. I can spek some French so I could understand the instructions (to an extent). The bus assistnat made NO ATTEMPT to help passengers with there luggage. He merely watched passengers of all ages putting there own luggage on the bus. (lazy and rude)The driver yelled 'Quelle Hotel' which i could understand but many travellers could not understand his ruse questioning.The hotel staff at the Sequoia were excellent. Friendly, well spoken and very helpful.The hotel was clean and quiet.You could walk from the hotel into Disneyland (10 15 mins) or catch a shuttle bus. Again no explanation by the driver that you needed to get off at the train station and walk 500 metres into the park.FoodAs was previously, the cost of food in the park is very expensive. I would recommend buying the food vouchers before you go, but dont buy a full board option, opt for the half board. You will get too tied down watching the clock for your next meal time.A half board option lets you choose a lunch time treat (tere are lots of places to get sandwiches, burgers etc...i.e. Earl of Sandwich, McDonalds etc)The meal vouchers are poorly explained but please note that you should book your restaurants early as the restaurants get full and you may not be able to get in. Also, some restaurants are only open lunch time ot tea time (some both)Beer is not always available...we found beer available at tea time but not lunchtime in some restaurants.Restaurants were understaffed and the service slow. The odd restaurants were however excellent i.e. Walts restaurant on Main street.We booked our restaurants on the first day (of a 5 day holiday) and the best time we could get into Cafe Disney (for a character dinner) was at 10:00pm. Not good enough when you have a 1 year old and a 5 year old.Menus also need a clarification which states which level of meal voucher you are using. We had a 'plus' meal voucher which allows you to use a certain number of selected restaurants and a particular set of meals.... this is unclear and it is easy to order food that is not on your meal plan.Snack Vouchersyou also get a set of snack vouchers which we found wee useless. You can only redeem these at certain times in certain venues. WE ended up throwing ours away. They need to be available for use all day and in all venues to be of any use.SmokingSmoking is allowed in the park...Entry TimeIf you visit by car and for the day, you will only be able to get in after 10:00am. Be prepared to queue for 30mins or more to get in.For people stopping in the complex, i.e. any hotel or the camp davey crocket, then you can get in at 8:00 but note that not all rides are open at 8:00 so it is a little bit misleading.Also, you need to access the park by the right hand queue (poorly signed) and show your disney hotel pass ID card. This gets you past the longer queues (day tripper queues)Ride Waiting TimesTimes displayed on the waiting time boards ere not particularly accurate. 10 mins could mean 20mins etc.Overall scoreI will go to Florida next time as the french resort is dated and in much need of a make over. The site is understaffed and the staff morale is generaly low. (not enough smiley faces)5 10","Negative"
"Neither my husband nor I had been there in over 20 years. It still has that Disney magic with a few new twists and turns. The sleds on the Matterhorn could stand some additional padding. That track coaster bounced like an old wooden coaster. I am a huge fan of Disney   s 101 Dalmatians but there is practically nothing in the parks or Disney Downtown about that movie; you can   t even select it as your favorite on line. I was very peeved when I realized that even the old time Fire Station on Main Street near City Hall didn   t have any Dalmatians. There was a ceramic statute in one store on Main Street but it wasn   t for sale. There was one animation cell for sale in Downtown Disney but that was it in the whole park! I realize they can   t have 101 real puppies but can   t they stick somebody in a character costume of Pongo or Purdy and have them hang out by the firehouse? A t shirt or two would have been nice. Perhaps they could make spotted mouse ears? They seemed to have every other incarnation of the things. I was happy to see the variety of food choices. You can buy juice and fresh fruit from the vendors rather than candy and fried foods which seem to be ubiquitous at other parks. I thought I was seeing things when I read the prices on the menus of some of the sit down restaurants. I was shocked that people waited in line to pay $25 for a sandwich at the Blue Bayou caf  . For that kind of money Mickey himself better be cutting my food and hand feeding me. Geesh.","Positive"
"I am 24 and I've never been to any Disneylands and WOW I loved it! The magic began as soon as I got on the direct train to Disneyland, the windows were the shape of mickeys head and there were little figurines. The park is a good size and it took me and my friend to complete within 6 hours. We also went on a Friday so the ques weren't long at all. It's a shame there wasn't more characters around the park. Well worth a visit!!","Positive"
"Save your money n just go to OceanPark. The HK Disney experience is terrible. Over priced, under sized. Not rewarding like Calif or FL. Save your money n go to the states. Attendance is down. Walt would be sad.","Negative"
"If you are looking for a unique Disney experience at Disneyland Paris, keep looking.This park is almost the same as the US counterparts and is just too American for the middle of France.I wish that they had made it more tailored to Europe.We all had fun but it was just average.","Neutral"
"We booked Disneyland Paris this year to celebrate New Year with our family and two other families. We stayed at the Newport hotel (separate review though issues are linked).Booking   terrible website. We were travelling by Eurotunnel and there was an offer on the home page that linked NYE tickets, food and free Eurotunnel. When clicking through the link the Eurotunnel element disappeared.The half board and breakfast option was otherwise best package but it was very vague as to what you could eat and where and we had to email support to get a list of where to eat (which had completely changed by arrival) The photos on the website did not give much of a clue about the hotel, the activities, the ridesor the park so I downloaded the app. Notmuch information on there either. A description of each ride (fear level) whether it   s indoor or outdoor would be incredibly helpful and a holiday countdown timer would be a useful bonus to that app at least.New Years Eve tickets were separate to the booking and quite costly and again it was very vague what    extra    we would gain from having these tickets. Turned out it was basically an extra cost to enter the park that would otherwise have been free and an extended parade and midnight fireworks show. No characters around no free celebration hats treats, nothing otherwise.The Park was beautiful no doubt and the staff were friendly and helpful at all points. There was a variety of things to see and do but mainly this appeals to either Disney or theme park lovers. I am not really either but my friends are and I could keep myself well occupied while they took on the worst rollercoasters. After years of playing the Disney game on X Box I was under the impression characters hung around on the park streets saying hello to children but in reality you have to queue up to meet them in side areas. Probably for money. Thing that makes a big difference here is weather. It rained 3 days out of 4. A lot of the rides have limited shelter but the majority is out in the open and when you   re soaked to the bone and wind gets up it   s hard to still feel the magic.Entrance is by paper tickets which we left at the hotel one morning adding an extra 35 mins walk back to the hotel for them. It   s (was) 2017 surely you   d think Disney would have progressed to electronic bands by now Centre Parcs have done it for years.The parades are outstanding and we got an amazing spot for NYE parade but we had to stand for 90 mins to reserve it and sneaky people tried to push their way in so it takes some willpower to hold your own for that long in the cold. Worth every second of waiting.The fireworks shows are amazing again best I have ever seen but once more ruined by people pushing into your viewing spots and standing on railings so no one else behind can see. New Years Eve tickets for these alone were not worth it. We spent 3.5hrs stood in a cold place with kids all huddled up together on the floor as they were so tired to get a decent view of the parade and the firework show which paid off for the parade but we could hardly see the fireworks for selfish people. Don   t waste your time. There   s a fireworks display around the lake in the village and the regular fireworks display the next night at 10pm was superior anyway and we got a better view half way up Main Street without any hanging around.The rides are really good. Like anywhere you can queue from 10 mins to over an hour. For non rollercoaster lovers I would recommend Star Wars simulator, Ratatouille, Pirates of the Caribbean and the animation show. Food on site is expensive and park vouchers get you more in some places than others I recommend Anabelles but avoid the Steak place. While you are there the app doesn   t always work as there is no WiFi, it   s good for checking queue times but again no info on the actual rides and we found it really hard to find toilets on it.I do think Disney Paris is a good place especially if you get good weather but as a test to see if we would enjoy Florida it   s actually put us off. I would expect more from a 25th Anniversary New Year   s Eve celebration in particular.","Neutral"
"We took our 2 grandsons to Disneyland for the day, while in LA for a short stay to bring in the New Year. We paid in excess of $600 for tickets for one park ( Disneyland ) and we paid the extra for the Maxpass to avoid long lines. The cost was never an issue as we have been to DisneyWorld in Fla many times and realize that while it is expensive, it was always worth it for the memories and the experience. The only memories we are going to bring away from our visit to DisneyLand are going to be off outrageous wait times on every ride ( and that was after waiting for 2 hours in a line to get through security despite getting there at 8.30am )the frustration of not being able to use the Maxpass because use is severely restricted. Once we booked our Maxpass on one ride, we were not allowed to book another for at least 2 hours. The reason for this was never given and befuddles me. When we were able to book another ride on Maxpass there were no times available for hours. All in, it was a terrible experience and I can say we will never be back. Thank god we only planned one day for DisneyLand during our stay, otherwise the whole trip would have been a disaster.","Negative"
"I would recommend not going to the park at the moment if you have older children due to so many rides closed. I presume it's all being refurbished for summer. When we were there they might as well shut down Frontier Land altogether as everything was closed apart from restaurants and merchandise shops. I feel we should be informed of this before we buy the tickets or provide a discount. Also, we queued for three other rides which closed due to technical issues. Three hours of waiting wasted. There were good points; all staff were friendly and helpful, the rides we did get on were good but overall disappointed and not worth the price at the moment.","Negative"
"We had a lovely time at Disneyland, Paris, stayed onsite at Newport Bay Hotel(see separate review)We have been to WDW in Florida many times and it is difficult not to compare, but am going to do my review without comparison and review DLP on it's own merit. When you first walk in to the park & see the castle it is so magical, especially for kids, it makes a lot of adults feel like they're 5 again too!!Walk up Main Street USA & there are 4 'lands' with different attractions on either side of Main Street and the castle:Adventure Land, Frontierland, Fantasyland(perfect for little ones) & Discoveryland.As we have done many of the rides at WDW, we decided to stick with our favourite at DLP and those they don't have in WDW.A quick review of some of them:Startours..only did this once as all the narration was in French my daughter thought this was boring.Indiana Jones ride .. Brilliant, great for those that love coasters...with an added loop. We did this 4 times!Big Thunder Mountain..another great coaster, check out the photos taken on the ride on your exit..really funny.Pirates of Caribbean, lovely family boat ride through PoC scenery.Buzz Lightyear..A must do! Try n get the highest score with your laser gun. Photos taken on this ride too.Phantom Manor..really good family ghost train, lots of good special effects.We only did The Carousel, Pinoccio & Peter Pan in Fantasyland, but have done all the attractions here and all good for families with young children.The walk around adventure land over the rickety bridge & through the skull is well worth doing, we bumped into the Jack Sparrow character here.We did the character afternoon tea(4.30 6pm) at The Cowboy Cookout, it was sooo good, the characters we saw were: Goofy, Daisy, Winnie the Pooh, Rabbit and Jessie. They each came round about 4 times for photos cuddles etc.Good choice of pastries cakes drinks too, we pre booked @   17pp, can book in DLP for around    19pp.Tips: if you're staying at a Disney Hotel make the most of extra magic hours from 8am 10am. These rides are open in Fantasyland: The carrousel, Dumbo, Tea cups, Peter Pan.In Discoveryland: Buzz Lightyear, Orbitron, Space Mountain.Use Fast Pass for as many rides as you can, it really does save lots of time queueing. Try Earl of Sandwich in the Disney Village for yummy, good value hot sandwiches(I've done a review on this too ;0) )Things that IMO let the park down and to be aware of: Smoking, it is allowed in the parks, I know you get smokers everywhere, but with big crowds and lots of smokers it can be unpleasant at times.Smoking in queues for rides: this happens, but shouldn't, you can report it to a cast member if it bothers you.Queue pushing: Happens at all parks not just DLP, but people do it a lot more blatantly at DLP!I didn't like the smoking or queue pushing...however, these niggles did not stop us enjoying ourselves, we still had a lovely time and really enjoyed our mini break... We are thinking of going back nxt August! Have a Magical time! :0)","Neutral"
"The subject says it all!! For young and old... It is the happiest place on earth! Worth every dollar spent! Even though its a little expensive... The rides, attractions, restos and stores... Even the performance makes it all worth it!!","Positive"
"If you are American or travel to the US often, skip the trip out to HK Disneyland. It's the exact same thing with literally only 5 10 products that are unique to Hing Kong and those are mostly key chains and t shirts. Just nothing special for a 45 minute train ride out of town","Negative"
"I am a Hongkonger and an international traveller. Heard from a number of local friends that HK Disneyland is, by comparision with those in other countries, far too small; thus is not as interesting and fun. That's why I only went there the 1st time recently ~ I totally enjoyed the whole day trip! Great Fun! 1) It offers all Disneyland fun activities in a nicely renovated and clean park. Why complain that it is small, as everyone knows that HK is small and almost anywhere is small ~ restaurants, shops etc. ? To look at it from another angle, you don't have to walk a long distance for another fun activity. It is fun after fun!2) Remember to arrive at 10:30 am to avoid the queue.3) If going with only adults, go with those who are joyful and has a heart of a child.Cheers!","Positive"
"Travelled for a friends young daughters birthday by ferry which was horrendous but that is for another review...quick tip...do not travel by ferry whilst black..absolutely awful people & surroundings.Checking into the park you are greeted by rather lecherous wardens who tried to get mine & my friends number..this is whilst we are with 2 under 6s..not impressedThe park itself is dated and tje main 'attractions' are the myriad of shops & arcades to spend lots of money in. Foodwise its disgusting & expensive..really commercial The disney chatacters act as if you are bothering them if you ask for a picture or even a signature which they will only sign in an expensive disney brand autograph bookIn general staff are rude & dismissive..we ended up missing half of the light show due to one not bothering to tell us what time it started despite us asking. The lightshow is beautiful but ruined by every father propping up their child on their shoulders so unless you are 7 foot  you havent got a chance of enjoying..and most children arent..Was so relieved to leave & return to the UK..awful experience would never go again even if I was offered a free ticket","Negative"
"Visited this place last Jan 23, 2006. Our all ride fee of USD70w as not worth it! Too small with very few rides for children and especially for adults. I think there were more commercial stores or souvenir shops than the rides you can enjoy. They have to drop the entrance fee by at least half so people can appreciate the place and what they paid for. NOt worth visiting the place at the moment not until they upgrade it very soon. The Ocean park is a lot better theme park to go rather than this place.","Negative"
"When visiting California (July9th 12th 2014) we had one day to spare so we decided why not take our almost 5 year old to Disneyland, we also have an 7 1 2month old as well. First off the parking is a joke, yes it is easy to park but then you have to catch a tram to the park and then walk which is ok when getting there but takes about an hour to get back to your car. It was much easier to just walk back to our hotel which was about a mile away. Our 5 year was super excited, she enjoyed seeing the castle and the characters throughout the park. I was impressed with the number of rides we were able to go on with our baby as well. For lunch we headed to Disney Downtown and ate at the Rainforest cafe (15min wait for a table:) We also went to their 2 story build a bear workshop, something my daugher had been saving for. The fun soon stopped while waiting in line to see Anna and Elsa, when we got in line they told us it was a 2 hour wait time, ha, it ended up being more like 4, it was a good thing my husband decided to take our son back to the hotel at this point and leave him with one our friends, it was just to hot for him to sit around out there. At about 3 hours into waiting for the girls a man at the gate said   everyone in this line is waiting to see at least one character from Frozen right?  Umm that didn't go well with all of the hot, miserable, irritated parents waiting to see BOTH princesses and trust me he heard it. We finally got into see the Elsa and Anna and they were really great with our daughter. This is something I would have skipped but my daughters heart had been set on seeing those girls since we booked our trip in January so there was no way of getting out of line, what I don't understand is why Disneyland doesn't have 2 sets of these girls so they can be lined up in 2 different places in the park seriously it only makes sense to get the lines moving quicker.After our 4 hour wait for princesses and taking the time to go to lunch it was about 4:30 and we had been on 3 rides for the day. We did end up going on 3 more rides for the day so a total of 6 rides all day (5 different rides as we rode one ride twice). The Jungle Cruise was great  our Skipper Melissa was absolutely hilarious! If I could have had her again I would have rode over and over just because she was so funny!We did get lucky and get on Splash Mountain with a 40min wait time and our daughter loved it! It's a small world was an ok ride for a 5 year old but a little old and creepy for me. The souvenirs are decently priced depending on what you are buying, we bought Minnie Ears at the hotel for 6 dollars but were able to get an entire Little Mermaid Polly Pocket set for 20 at the park which I didn't think was too bad.","Positive"
"We have just returned from visiting Disney with my family and disabled granddaughter. What should have been the trip of a lifetime for her   turned out to be a 'nightmare'. ~Unfortunately, it seems if you are disabled at Disney then your options to ride become limited. They appear to have a rule that only 1 disabled person can ride at any one time!!!!!!! Therefore, all the able bodied pile on and the disabled have to sit and wait or in our case 'book an appointment'! (I thought you only did that at the hairdressers doctors etc.,) Unfortunately, my little granddaughter requires a wheelchair and does not understand the concept of having to wait and gets very distressed. On the first day we found a lovely ride (small world) it was perfect because they had an adapted boat and we could wheel her right on   she loved it and we went round twice! There were only three rides in the park that she could tolerate, but small world was her favourite. We went back the following two days and had a great experience until FRIDAY! We arrived at the ride and there was a small group of 3 waiting in the disabled queue. We were met by one of the attendants to be told  you will have to make an appointment . My daughter and I looked flabbergasted and asked why because we hadn't done this on the previous three days   so what had changed. She told us we could come back in approx. 1 hour 20 min and waived papers in front of us of what appeared to be bookings. By this time the people who had been sat in the disabled queue had boarded and set off. My granddaughter was getting really distressed and we were trying to calm and reassure her. Then the boat which is designed to carry the wheelchair arrived and we pointed out that this was free and not being used   so why could she not have a ride. Again the attendant waived papers at us and stipulated we needed an appointment!! The three of us left small world in tears! They could not see or acknowledge that this little girl had been left frustrated, distressed and very confused!! The staff do not appear to use what we call 'COMMON SENSE'!!!!!!!!!! Because that's all that was required and a little girls day would have been made and not ruined. Disney overall for the disabled (depending on level of disability) easy to push round, grounds very nice but if wheelchair bound only a few rides available. They all indicate person must be able to transfer themselves! In terms of 'Small World' staff on that particular day   I think 'Walt Disney' would have turned in his grave!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Negative"
"I've been to all the Disney Parks in the world, and this is probably the most disappointing.First the good   the Space Mountain ride here is more intense than other parks' version. It's definitely the highlight if you have older kids, or want something more exciting.The park was really crowded the day I was there. The wait estimates were terribly bad in a few rides. The Indiana Jones ride was closed. The Thunder Mountain Railroad closed repeatedly. And even the Buzz Lightyear Laser thing had problems. We wanted to ride the circling railroad at 6pm, and was told that it was closed too. On top of that, service was typically French, with an attitude. Wait for lunch at Videopolis was ridiculously long   about 20 minutes. French don't serve ice with cold drinks. When I asked for ice, I got a dirty look for server. When we asked for fruit cup instead of fries, we got another dirty look, even though the menu clearly says you have a choice. The dance at Videopolis was quite amateurish, and not very good.There are only 3 attractions for older kids here, and 2 of 3 were closed that day. The other strange thing is that at almost all the rides, you see people cutting using the handicapped lane. While some looked handicapped, many don't. Instead, they hold some sort of paper. Is this some sort of VIP thing? I haven't seen this in other Disney parks.","Neutral"
"What's going on here in the 21st Century with superfast technology? My young grand daughter wants picture with one of the Disney Princesses at the Pavilion in Fantasyland   Simple? No. You turn up and are told you have to come back the following day before 10.00 to get a ticket for a specific time, but what they don't tell you is you have to stand in a queue for almost two hours (in the pouring rain in our case) to end up having to utilise one of four touch screens (one was out of order) to choose one of two times that day. However, doesn't end there, when you turn up at your allotted time they keep you waiting another 1 hour to have a few minutes to have a picture taken with a Disney Princess not of your choice. So in summary, 3 hours of your precious time queuing for a 2 minute photo shoot which they have a cheek of charging you 15 euros for if you want to buy the picture. COME ON DISNEYLAND PARIS, COME INTO THE 21st CENTURY and stop treating your visitors like a herd of cattle!","Negative"
"Visiting Disneyland is dream for Kids & adults as well. We visited earlier in Paris but first time for my boy. The Disney train is really really lovely. Unfortunately during our visit the Main castle was closed for renovation & many other rides were closed due to Typhoon hence had limited choice. Even in evening the fireworks was cancelled & replaced with Parade which was good.Too small compare to the one in Paris with two attractions Disney Park & Studio but still good.Suggest to book ticket in advance preferable online at discounted price.","Neutral"

Definitely not the most magical place on earth I will go to Disney Orlando again in a minute as we   ve been there many times the girls wanted to try something new so we went to California Disney instead so disappointed. Snow White ride malfunctioned and my husband was hit with the cart. Employee didn   t even care just picked up his back pack that was dropped in the process and handed it to him. The ride was closed down due to him being hit though. None of us ever have the want to return to Disneyland again.","Negative"
"Overall I actually love Disneyland and had a pretty great time. What ruined in for me was no one spoke to me. I've had rheumatoid arthritis since I was two and use a wheelchair and at every attraction bar one or two (shout out to guy at the carousel) every single employee asked my husband if I can walk transfer. After 27 years in a wheelchair I had gotten used to it (which is messed up in itself), but I found that once I had children people realised I could most likely respond. I had my three year old in my lap 90% of the time and my six year old nearby. I was usually chatting to them when the cast would overlook me to speak to my husband.I'm feeling a little less than because of this treatment. No one deserves to feel overlooked and less than.

"Our first Disneyland experiance, and VERY sad to say probably our last.Our trip to Disnetland Paris started off of a very poor footing (see my review for Dream Castle to understand), but that was yesterday, today we start living our dreams, or maybe not.So off into living our childhood dreams we go, the day started out brillantly, I highly recommend the Tower of Terror, the 8 of us who went on it could not stop laughing, it was very well setup and the staff really got into their role playing, an excellant ride.As to was the Rock N Roller coaster, Crush's Coaster and Space Mountain 2, and despite having to queue for all of the rides, we loved them.Then it our dream ride came to a horrible stop, the first one happened after we queued for 55 minutes for the Indiana Jones ride, only to be told that it was now closed due to  technical  issues, so off we went to the next ride (Pirates of the Caribbean) and again, after being in the queue for over 40 minutes.Ok, so these things happen, off to Buzz LIght Year, now the lines are really getting long (mayhap to do with the rides being closed), we were in the line for 70 minutes, and low and behold, the dreaded anouncment comes saying that this to is closed.This patern was repeated on 5 more rides, it's now pushing 9 pm by this time, we have been in the parks since they opened (10am) and have manged to get onto a total of seven (7) rides, the upside is that we all manged to work on our tans whilst standing in the never ending queues, which would have all been great, had we managed to actually get to the rides that we were queuing for.We ended up visiting the Town Hall (office) to lodge our concerns, the poor lstaff at the desk were being attacked from every direction, and our sympathy well and truly went out to them, while they were fending of disgrunted people from amost every corner of the planet.The lady that we dealt with told us the the  technical  issue was to do with the heat affecting the power, which knowing a bit out this type of issue, appears to be an overload to the power system, which seems to have been addressed by the site controllers by  cycling  the power to various rides to ease the demand on the system, rather than just shuttig down one or two rides for the day. After hearing our issues she gratfully gave us some Fast track tickets to both Buzz Light Year, and Space Mountain (these were the rides that we had mostwanted to go on), we left her to tackle a very p'd lady and off to grab our last rides for the day.Well that was our plan, to everyones pure delight (NOT) both of the rides were out of service.This is the point were we all gave up and decided that the hotel was a better option.For our next attempt at such outings, we're thinking of trying one of the Universal or Six Flag attractions, for if this is how Disney runs a park, then we'll be giving them all a massive berth.Gary","Negative"
"Awesome day for the kids and us I guess. Just like Disneyland in LA but a little smaller. Awesome Star Wars stuff and the new Hyperspace Mountain was fantastic!!! Easy to get to on the train. Food is a little on the pricey side but not too bad.","Positive"
"I'm a 23 years old and this was my first trip to Disneyland   it was awesome! Loved every second and it did not disappoint! I went in the first week back at school for American kids, and a couple of rides were closed for Halloween preparations ... and so there were no lines! Longest wait was 15min, and I went on Splash Mountain 3 times with no lines at all! This made up for the closed rides. I met all of the Princesses, enjoyed the sun & had a ball. Disneyland I can't wait to come back! Had lunch at Tortilla Jo's in Downtown Disney, decent food, relaxing & great margaritas!","Positive"
"This place is much too overcrowded and over priced which took all of the fun out of our visit. First, long lines to get through security. Then long lines to purchase very expensive tickets. Then long lines to use our expensive tickets and enter an overcrowded park. Then long lines for every ride and amusement (many exceeding one hour). Then discovering that my favorite rides we closed. No Pirates of the Caribbean, no Matterhorn, no train, no Tom Sawyer's Island, and no Mark Twain paddle wheeler. Then to have two rides break down after waiting in long lines (Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain.) Then to wait in long lines for overpriced and bland food, and discovering that they had run out of forks and napkins. Then to wait in long lines for a rest room. Then to take a really hard look at many of the worn out buildings, and being turned off by old out of date rides (submarine, Autopia, Small World). Then to find expensive snacks ($4.00 for a chocolate chip cookie? Come on!!!). The Magic is Gone from Disneyland. Walt Disney would be embarrassed and ashamed. It's not the park I knew as a kid in the 60s and 70s. Corporate greed at its very worst. Don't go here. Don't go here. Please do not go here!!!","Negative"
"This is my First Time came to Disneyland. I enjoy all the show but don't go there in winter, very cold weather and raining. Easy to traveled by MTR, just transit at Sunny Bay and then Interchange to Disneyland Resort Line. It is Recommended to go in the afternoon, because you can watch Fireworks in the night. See the schedule for Fireworks and for other show (like parade, Mickey 3D show, etc). The staff really friendly, they help us so much. We need to take a lot of money, because lots of souvenirs, so cute.. I love it. I wait until 9PM for watching Fireworks. Really nice and worth it for waiting. For the food is not worth for your money because too expensive, but the place really nice. Magical Place and awesome. I'm happy to be there. Next trip I'll go there again.","Positive"
"Oh boy. So crowded. Even on a Wednesday. Lots of rides broken or closed. Wait times ridiculous even using fast pass. Save yourself the peril and pick another destination. Tip if you do go , get there in the early morning 8:00 am. However if you do want to arrive early, stay at the resort, because LA traffic will be prohibitive. You   ll spend more this way. Catch 22! Park is 60 years old and has not expanded much, but attendance has tripled. Our kids 12 and 13 has about 0 fun. Really Disney? For these prices everything should be operational and you should not have time to eat your over priced lunch while waiting in line for a ride that may or may no work by the time you get to starting gate. UUGH","Negative"
"Meh   it was fine   not many rides for older kids, seemed like a tired park.  Much more of a urban theme park than it's Florida cousin.  Not quite as magical...","Neutral"
"We covered both the studios and the main park in a single day, so we definitely did not have time to cover everything, however we still had a great time. This park is much bigger than the studios, so there are a lot of rides which are suitable for all ages out here, hence more family fun. We managed to get a good view of the main parade as well as the    Spring is Here    dance, and the photographs are so vivid and beautiful, it was well worth it. We   d already met the characters we most wanted to see in the studios, so we went on a few rides here, which were all fun, but had long queues. We were relieved that we   d packed our own picnic, as I saw really long queues in the restaurants. Pick up a map and program at the entrance to help you plan and buy your souvenirs towards the end of the day, else you   ll end up carrying them throughout. Overall, great Disney magic for sure!","Positive"
"Something that seems to go hand in hand with a Disney trip is crowds. The Anaheim park doesn't break this trend. We made our visit on what was meant to be a quiet day, midweek in the middle of May. The place was packed and it was uncomfortable. You couldn't move around the park freely and were constantly avoiding strollers and other guests. At points you were just standing still waiting for the crowds to move on enough so you could continue and occasionally darting to the edge of the pathways just to take a break from it. I've been to a few Disney's and this one cant handle the crowds. The crowd problem aside, there were a few rides closed which is a shame when you've travelled thousands of miles and only have a 1 day visit. I understand that they have to close rides at some point for maintenance but its always disappointing to find that a much anticipated ride is closed. Food and drink was, as expected, costly. There is a nice nostalgic feeling when walking around this park, knowing that its a snippet of Walt's vision, and you can feel it. Considering the crowds the park was clean and what we thought, well kept. Tomorrowland was looking a bit ropey but overall it was good. We didn't get on many rides due to the crowds. The end fireworks display was excellent and a good finish to the day.Disneyland is so worth a visit and there's no doubt we had a good time, but those crowds put a bit of a downer on our 1 day visit.","Neutral"
"Good to see while here, but very small. Great if we brought the children, but not for adults who have been to other ones. Not exciting for bigger children either.","Neutral"

"I am very disappointed that i have to write this complaint, but we were very unsatisfied with our stay at Santa Fe Hotel, Disneyland Paris from 6th November '09 to 8th Novemever '09. We went especially for our child's first birthday as we wanted it to be a special, magical day for him.  There were numerous issus that arose over our weekend at Disneyland Paris, and feel that these should be reported and followed up. As a customer and mother I do not agree how these issues could of occured on our visit and am disgusted that Disneyland Paris allow such rude and unfriendly attitudes towards their paying customers. Firstly, when we arrived we were given a room on the first floor of which there was no lift for us to take the pram up even though on our booking we had noted that we had a baby with us. We had to go back to reception and ask for a room on the ground floor. The next room we were given was right next to the main entrance into the building. The main entrance door to the block would not shut so a draft was coming underneath our door. We stopped the draft by putting towels down by the door. We had a baby in a cot which is close to the floor, having to put towels by the door to stop the draft is really not good enough. When initially checking in, we were asked a time we would like to have breakfast. We asked if we had to chose a time as with a baby we are never on time and didnt want to rush. We were told that we had to chose a time, so we did. The next morning we frantically rushed to get ready for our allocated breakfast time, only to find ourselves waiting in a long queue. At first we thought the queue was for our table and waited patiently. As we had to rush to make it down on time, our baby was still in his night clothes. We then realised the majority of people in the queue did not have their ticket with an allocated time on, and the Disneyland Staff were just letting them in for breakfast with no priority for the people queuing with a ticket. When we finally found a table we found it to be dirty, the milk machine was out of milk, there were only broken bits of bread in the bread basket and there were no glasses to get juice. This is unacceptable. We are trying to get our child used to a feeding time. We had to break our schedule to fit in with the Santa Fe rules, only to find out nobody was sticking to the rules anyway.All this time was wasted which we could have spent in the park. Our friends then went back to the room to get a shower while we finished eating and feeding our baby. On return to the room, they found the new key they were given didn't work, so they had to go back to reception to fix this problem. Once again, more time that was lost that could have been spent in the park. They had to queue for a considerable amount of time to get to the reception desk, only to then speak to an incredibly rude and ignorant manager. Our friends explained the problem about the key to him, and expressed that they were disappointed about loosing time in the park as they also had to queue for breakfast when other people were allowed to push in etc. The manager replied that there were problems at Santa Fe with regards to the breakfast, but they had tried numerous other ways of doing it and the way they were currently using worked best. He then went on to add that he had been to many other hotels throughout the world and that they all have problems. Our friends said that they were also frequent travellers and had not seen breakfast in such shambles as that! The manager went on to argue with our friends that he had been to more countries and and stayed in more hotels than they had!! We find this to be completely unprofessional. The manager tried to resolve the problem by promising that he would come back to the room and fix the key. He never did. The rest of our 2 day stay we had to share the key which was completely unreasonable.  When we finally got to the park we were having a lovely time until.. We had booked the 'Birthday Meet and Great' in the Lucky Nugget for our son's first birthday. Again, we wanted his day to be extra special and one to remember for all of us. I phoned twice and both times when I reseved a place I was asked for his age and name. Once again, we had to wait a considerable amount of time to even be let into the Lucky Nugget, in which time other guests had started gathering outside. When the doors eventually opened, we found the other guests to push in and bombard other guests. With regards to Health and Safety, this is a very dangerous situation.  When we arrived we were seated at a table and then we went to change our son's nappy. When we came back, the staff were handing out the birthday cakes. We found the waiters to be very rude. They literally plonked the cake down in front of us. Nobody said happy birthday to him. A card was also placed on the table which was blank. It didn't even his name writen on it.  Goofy, Pluto, Tigger and Tac came round to meet our son, of which he loved. Then we spotted Mickey, but he was going round every table so we thought he would come to us last as we were situated near the end. When Mickey finally got to the tables near us, we assumed he would then come to us. To our dismay we relised he was about to leave, so my partner went over to him and kindly asked if he could you come over to say happy birthday to our son and sign his card. Mickey's helper then very rudely and abruptly replied  no, we are going he has no more time . We were so incredibly disappointed and upset by this. Our son has a Disneyland Paris autograph book with pictures of him with everyone except Mickey. Later, the staff then brought around the surprise for the the birthday boy girl and missed our table, so I went to the bar and asked if our son could have his surprise. A staff member called Aissa then went to get one and gave it to our son. We quickly realised the surprise was not suitable for under 3's, so we asked them if he could have a different surprise suitable for his age group. Aissa then went to find another product and once again came back with another surprise that was not suitable for under 3's. Aissa told us they didn't have anything for under 3's which I found funny as we were in Disney which is aimed at children, and we had seen things suitable for his age group around the park. We found the lady we spoke to very abbupt and her attitude towards us appalling. I was concerned my son would pick up on her negative approach as they pick things up so quickly at his age. I informed her that we had paid for him to have a birthday cake, meet the characters and receive a birthday surprise and that he had not recieved his surprise. She rudely replied 'You didn't pay for him'. We had to pay 19 euros a head for the adults. What right does she have to talk to paying customer like that? She then tried to get around the situation by telling us the surprise was not included in the price, and then told us that he could have the surprise that was not suitable for under 3's for him. Items have warnings printed on them for a reason. If our son had choked on the gift that Disneyland Paris gave him that was not suitable for his age group, imagine the public interest and what would be printed in the newspapers. Luckily we did notice, but if Disneyland Paris is going around giving presents to other children and the parents are not so alert to this, it's an accident waiting to happen. I told her that I would like to speak to a manager about these issues, only to be told there were no mangers on site. Once again, if something was to happen in the Lucky Nugget and there was no manager around to handle the situation, imagine the interest of the public and newspapers. Something else waiting to happen really!Finally a supervisor came and spoke to us. He was very pleasant and understanding of our issues raised to him. He also told us that we could complain near the entance of the park and explained that he could not do much more than which we found to be resonable. So, why couldn't Aissa who gave him the unsuitable toy, or the manager at Santa Fe handled it the same? Why did they have an abusive, threatening and uncaring attitude towards us? We're paying customers, wanting a fantastic birthday for our son. We found the staff to be unreasonable with us and make our time at Disneyland Paris uncomfortable and stressful. So much time was wasted going back and forth which could have been spent in the park. We're disgusted that Disneyland Paris employ people with such poor customer service and unacceptable approach to customers to work around children and deal with children and families everyday on their special occasions. The time for his birthday party was runined and we payed 19euros a head *4 to be argueing a fair point with a staff member that was so unreasonable and rude which i feel is totaly wrong. We paid   636 for 2 nights in a draughty room which was not suitable for a child to sleep in a cot low to the floor. When we complained at City Hall the staff were very helpful, understanding and friendly. They totaly understood our point that we could not give this toy to our son and kindly gave him teddy which was very kind. Why couldn't that have been done earlier at the Lucky Nugget? They were also very sympathetic about our troubles at Santa Fe. They informed us to write to Disneyland Paris as this is not acceptable behaviour for staff at Disney. We are so angry and upset to think we paid all that money for our son's birthday and ended up treated in such a poor manner. Disneyland Paris is meant to be a family park and we didn't expect such low standards, rudeness and aggressiveness.  So, that was his first birthday. It was meant to be incredibly special. Instead, it was an incredible let down.","Negative"
"Having been to Disneyland Orlando twice in the past 5 years I was hoping my first visit to Disneyland Paris would be bring the magic back.Having arrived all of the family were excited. My first impressions weren't good the toilets in the car park were in a very poor state. The toilet situation didn't improve through out the parks they all smelt and were very dirty and needed a good clean. The wife changed the youngest outside the toilets as they were too dirty.The Park was ok and the rides if running were good but we all felt the Park was missing the Magic of what I associate with Disney, the Main Street had music and characters in the street but once you leave the main street and start exploring you could be anywhere. In the US you would have lots of music and characters walking around and staff entertaining your kids but this was missing in Paris.I'm glad I went but felt slightly let down but the dirtiness I wont be returning.If you go please be prepared to spend lots as the food was overpriced and poor. 2 cheese burgers and chips and 2 kids meals came to 38 euros !!","Neutral"
"Take an umbrella and you'll be ok. Lines are under cover, but some attractions like meet the characters are not on. Parade was cancelled, but a good day out anyway. Haven't been to any other Disneyland to compare. Access by train is easy.","Positive"
"Was really excited to experience my first Disneyland with wife and young child. Left the day feeling like I had not experienced Disney or its characters. Disneyland Paris is mainly merchandise shops and restaurants. For every ride, there are 2 shops. Having paid about    250 to get 2 adults 1 child in on basic tickets, this really took the fun out of it.We barely did anything. We were limited to toddler friendly rides and the wait time all day was 45 60 minutes on average. In 7 hours we were able to do three rides, one maze, have lunch and snacks, see the parade, and briefly visit the studio area. There are no Disney characters or staff to be seen. Apart from the parade, in 7 hours we saw one Mickey and were prevented from approaching him (VIP event) and one Aladdin running late to something. To see characters you have to queue for 45 90 minutes. Although overcrowded, it felt lifeless as its just visitors walking aimlessly everywhere.I am sure the Disneyland concept works in the USA ( though I'm not from there). However France lacks the customer service, work ethic or attention to detail to pull this off.Disappointed, Disney Group.","Negative"
"I think if we hadn't been to Disneyland in LA, and Florida I think it would have been a lot better. The queues for rides where huge. Food outlets were overpriced and crowded. The staff looked unhappy not like LA every one looked like they loved there jobs and being paid were a bonus but not in euro disney. It just didn't feel like the happiest place in the world. ( just no magic). There were a few rides that are not at other parks. Even the parade at Disneyland Paris had come and gone with out even knowing it was on. We caught the end 10 min and didn't even know. Main Street weren't even blocked off. Like at other park were you have to get your spot 2 hours before . My tips. Get a few day pass with magic mornings. It costs a bit more but you can go in 2 hours before the public.Take a few snacks and drinks, saves you some money to spent on Disney souvenirs. As soon as you go in go start to the big rides. If you wait for a few hours the waiting time is 1 hour  Also a good time to go is when the parades are on","Neutral"
"Staff   bored and uninterested.Rides   often breaking down.Food   ugh!Smoking   everywhere   it's a kids park for goodness sakeQueues   use fast pass or don't bother, and lots of pushing inCharacters   what characters?Pin exchange   sparse, and again uninterestedOverall experience   poorAdvice to others   save up and go to Florida.","Negative"
"Went with my sister and three girls aged 9, nearly 7 and 4.Be prepared to queue. Even for rides like the tea cups we queued over 20 minutes. The bigger rides were over an hour. They have a fast pass system on certain rides which means you put your park ticket in a machine and get a ticket with an alloted time to go on the ride. Although they advertise that you can have five fast passes a day read the small print which says you can only have one fast pass at a time. So our idea of getting fast passes at the beginning of the day for 5 rides went badly wrong!Oh did I also mention that you have to queue to get a fast pass..grrrr.Our girls do not like scary rides so did not go on 'big thrill' rides. In Disney our favourites were Peter Pan..feels a bit like you are flying, Buzz Lightyear..you are in a carriage shooting aliens with guns..great fun, Its a Small World..a boat trip around countries (the girls loved this but I found it a bit spooky..don't like those dolls!).In Walt Disney Studios Park...Stitch Live was really impressive.If your kids don't like to be scared then watch out for the 3d honey I shrunk...it has realistic 3d snakes and other scaries. In the Studios Park the film tour bus ride special effects bit was impressive but it really scared the kids so be careful if they don't like fire and water! Don't want to post a spoiler but if you want to know more then email me. The Snow White ride was also full of witches and may be a bit scary for young kids.The 5pm parade was lovely, a really nice end to the day. Talking of characters if your kids want to do the autographs then try and catch the characters on walk about if you can...we queued for over an hour in 26 degree heat to get minnies photo and signature..worth it for the photo..they take a professional photo which you can buy and ours was a really nice momento but still a long time to wait. I would only do this for one character and only if they really want to. The queue did not seem that big but everyone in front had a signature and a photo so be warned as the queue did not move!High School Musical Parade is also on in Disney studio at the moment and the kids loved it (and me too if I am honest!).Didn't get chance to see the shows as the queues were just too big..come on Disney sort out advance booking for the shows as there was a huge queue an hour before the show doors even opened...too long to wait with young children.Anyway feel free to email with any questions, happy to help if I can!","Neutral"
"I love visiting here with my girlfriend but it was ridiculously packed this time about 3 4 hours wait times for each ride. For the price of the ticket it was not that worth it","Negative"
"The park is divided by two.. disneyland park and movie park. You have to pay separately for each park. If you combine both park in a day also quite expensive. The castle and atmoshfere is lovely but as not as big like other attraction park i have been in the Netherlands. Disneyland has his big name with all disney character. The price for lunch and souvenir way too expensive. We did enjoy our visit but not worth enough to be back soon.","Neutral"
"Disneyland was wonderful.  We used one of those apps that let you know wait times for rides and what rides were closed.  The app worked perfectly.  We were also pleasantly surprised by the food we had.  It was reasonable and it was good.","Positive"
"For this money what you give for Disneyland you can go in Germany and visit three parks and make your children great happiness!!! Das is very very bad, stuff don't want to speak english you can only understand if you speak French, everything is very expensive, we buy a ticket for only one park, because we knew that that we cannot visit to parks with our children 6 and 9 years old in one day, they was very disappointed!!! For every attraction they have to wait more than one hour, they was very nervous, everything else is nice only for eyes and that's it!!! For picture with Mickey Mouse we have to wait almost two hours, that was crazy, but what is Disneyland visit without picture with Mickey Mouse?! With so many people they have to make 10 Mickey Mouse places not only one, and also with other characters they have to walk through the park that every child have a chance to make picture with them, because this is crazy you can go there and do nothing just waiting... or in every corner go to the shop and children crying for this or that we're also everything so expensive is, very very disappointing!!! I suggest people not to go there, to save money and nerves because that's really nothing!!!!!!!The only positive thing about Disneyland ist feuerwerk at 11 o'clock!!!","Negative"
"With a Star Wars fan and a Disney Princess fanatic, this was one amazing vacation destination! A three day pass or more is a must, just when we thought there was nothing left to see, we found a ton more! We had such an incredible time, we're already thinking about our next trip! Many of the rides allow baby's in carriers, or just held on your lap, which was wonderful. An early entry pass is something that I would highly recommend, especially if your kids want to meet any of the more popular characters or go on the more popular rides. The biggest downfall, in my opinion, is the cost of everything inside the park. There are very few souvenir options that are inexpensive and still reasonably nice, and all of the food is easily triple what you would pay outside the park, so pack a lot of snacks and bring lots of your own water! And plan to be there from open until close every day you're there, the sore feet are well worth it!","Positive"
"What a magical place   Such a good laugh and plenty to do   The only thing that would improve the overall experience is if you could have more than 1 fast pass ticket at a time","Positive"

"Well where to start.We went on a family trip for 2 days,1 night at Santa fe hotel.The hotel and staff were friendly and pleasant.So on the short walk up to the park we get to the disney village where the shops and food outlets are,looks really clean and tidy .You start to get into that magical feeling of disney,looking forward to getting in the park.Get to the entry gates greeted by a really grumpy rude staff member,oh ok not a good start.The parade starts not long after we get in so it makes up for it , so get back into it.Really good parade the pirate and princess.Starting to walk around and go to rides finding that a wait time of an hour for most of them in general. We go to get a drink and ice cream at a vendor, to hard for them to say hello and goodbye apart from how much they want.Not long into the park i say to my wife ,why are people looking so miserable jokingly. We did not see any characters walking around the park at all, you can wait for an hour to meet one.The magical feeling dissapering quickly here.The food is very expensive and awful ,frozen mush heated in a microwave.You can get better looking food at loan prices.A good thing here now, the closing show was awesome really good and felt like disney .My opinion is that the park is loosing money every year and this shows, things look tired and run down no money being put into it.The staff probably hate working there and wages are probably bad (my opinion)Not once did we hear welcome to Disneyland, you do not feel a part of it. I think disney land paris has had its time.Close the doors on it, this is not what Walt Disney would want of it. I am sorry to say this.There is no magic there.","Negative"
"I went to Disneyland with family on 4 19 and had a great time. The shuttle from the parking lot was fast. It seemed crowded but the longest line I sat in was about 30 minutes. We were able to use fast pass to get on enough rides to not have to wait long. Walking around the park itself seemed cramped which is why I said it was crowded. All in all it was still a lot of fun.I have been to Disney World Magic Kingdom many times and found Disneyland to be almost exactly the same. Disney World is a little more spread out. A few of the attractions were different. I was with a 9 year old and an 11 year old. They both seemed to enjoy the park and felt it was on par with Magic Kingdom. Space mountain was a little different than the ride in Florida and in Florida there are 2 Dumbo rides but for the most part the parks are almost exactly the same...without the heat in Orlando.Fantasyland seemed a little more cozy in Disneyland and had a few more rides for little ones.The food options at Magic Kingdom are better. We ended up eating dinner at Downtown Disney which had plenty of options. The area is also a short walk from both parks in the area. The fact that both Disneyland and California Adventure were both 100 yards apart would have made things easy if we planned on going to both. One problem we did have was the Fantasyland section basically shut down at 8:30 or 9 pm for a fireworks show. Getting to the surrounding areas was very difficult at that time.We did have a great time and would come back again if ever in the area again!","Positive"
"The queues were very long, many of the popular rides were closed for refurbishment. It would have been helpful if public announcements were made about closures and break downs. The rides are getting a bit old and creaky. The day we visited it was about 37 degrees so staff were not as friendly as usual.","Negative"
"Disneyland was what it promises to be! Very entertaining and enticing. Had gone for my 9 yr old daughter. She is a Frozen fan. Overall experience was very good but found that the whole place is more of a marketing and sales promotion for Disneyware. Every building is actually shop selling something at seriously exorbitant prices.But apart from that, it did make my daughter super happy! Be prepared for spending a lot. And of course for walking a lot. Several long queues for every attraction. Plan to spend three full days for really exploring the place properly. My suggestion is that though its kinda expensive it will really help if you stay in one of the Disney hotels on the Park premises if you can afford to. Particularly if you are visiting in summer. As the Park is open till midnight in summer you will be able to make the most of it. Commuting from Paris to the park will get you exhausted and take a lot of time out of your schedule.Also buying tickets online in advance is a must. Otherwise you may feel the pinch. Google and find out how to buy cheapest tickets.","Positive"
"Disneyland paris is a fun place with plenty of rides and attractions for children, especially younger ones. It was relatively easy to get around and see most things in 2 3 days. We particularly enjoyed the motor and bike stunt show . Downsides were the long queues for some attractions, e.g Pirates of the Caribbean was almost a hour long queue. The food and drinks were also a bit expensive.","Neutral"
"We just has the WORST experience ever at Disneyland. We went on a Tuesday it was so jam packed my daughter got injured by someone ramming into her shoulder. There is NO good time to go to Disney anymore. It is only going to get worse when they build the new Star Wars land. I can hardly call it a great time at Disney when your daughter is walking through the rides in tears because her shoulder hurts so bad. You may think this isn't Disney's fault, but it most certainly is. A park is over sold if you can't even move without getting an injury. We will never go back until they fix this. Maybe they need to turn people away.","Negative"
"Our 3rd visit here, 2009, 2012 and now 2015, we have a 9,3 and 6m old, in 2009 and 2012, the characters use to walk around the park so you'd be able to get photos and autographs but that's all stopped. We should have had 5 days, 4 nights but we came home a day early, both older children we're crying during day as 3 occasions they queued to get a signature and photo and each time a staff member it the rope across them or people in front after 30 min in the line. We only managed to get on a few rides as the wait times were all around 1hr long and the middle child always wanted a wee towards the end. A 50 queue to see Mickey Mouse, you have to make a reservation to see 1 Disney princess, the light show at the end did not have frozen in it. Sorely disappointed and will not be coming back","Negative"
"What can you say about Disneyland tgat hasn't already been said. It was great as usual and the cast members went out of their way to ensure the experience was top notch. As a veteran of the hospitality industry with over 20 years of experience I am always intrigued with how well Disney does everything. The new firework show was amazing but I was not prepared for how unbelievable the new Fantasmic would be. It left my son with his mouth hanging open. Bravo for an absolutely magical experience.","Positive"
"you cannot beat the magic of disney and to see th look on the little ones faces is priceless apart from from some attractions shut ( we already knew about this) we had a great time the only thing what spoilt it was the sas mafia what GUARD the characters stopping the litlle ones getting autographs etc and no inprompto scenes with interactions with the little ones not a patch on usa","Neutral"
"Its starting to get a bit jaded. Lots of upgrading being undertaken which means many rides are unreliable or not available which puts pressure on rides that are open. Wish we had been fully informed about this before we went as we would have postponed this visit.We had to be evacuated from one ride having queued for half an hour, another failed before we could get on board.....annoying.The younger kids still see it as magical, those of us who have been before are a bit disappointed.","Neutral"

"I went there last Saturday with my friends. We decided to buy a photopass to register the moments at the breakfast with the characters and in some rides. The staff member at the shop guaranteed that would have loads of professional photographers around but we didn't see any.No photographers at the breakfast and just a couple of rides with the service. Two of them not even operating that day. Result we spent 60 euros for 10 pictures.We tried to talk to a member of staff but he didn't show much interest and just sent us to the city hall that was at the other side of the park and it was packed so we gave up.We asked directions to a show and another member of staff said the show was over and it hadn't even started yet. After over an hour in two of the biggest attractions they had technical problems and didn't bother to give us even a fast pass to come back later... staff said that we have to come back later and queue again.Disneyland Paris never again!It's better go to Orlando... I've been there 2 times before and never had a problem. ","Negative"
"Reaching Disneyland Hong Kong was easy through the MTR. Wherever you are in Hong Kong through the MTR you get off at Sunny Bay and then on to the pink line to Disneyland.This Disneyland is very small compared to the ones in Anaheim and Disney World in Orlando (I have never been to those in Tokyo or Paris).I always describe my visit to Disney either in Anaheim or Orlando as a Prozac pill that will last me for a year. So in accordance, believing in the magic of Disney I thought this will apply to Disneyland Hong Kong. I visited the park on the 14th of July 2014 and it was hot, not hotter than Orlando, but for the life of me I do not know why I couldn   t tolerate the heat.The people there were loud, cut lines and had the most undisciplined children ever.The stands that offer ice cream, popcorn or cotton candy also had dried squid that smelled awful. And guess what? People actually bought that dried squid and ate them and fed them to their kids leaving a disgusting smell during waiting lines. We went to Disney Hong Kong as couple, my husband and I, we tried to stay tolerant but after an hour and half in to the park I wanted to leave. I was so looking forward to the fireworks but I got a massive headache from all the loud speaking people there. Either they were hard of hearing or I had sensitive ears. I did not experience the magic of Disney. I need a do over.","Negative"
"I Visited the park for 3 days with my wife and 6 year old daughter.The park itself is great for kids. Meet and greets are excellent if you have the patience to wait.The rides are mostly for kids. I recommend Ratatouille ride but that one gets very busy. A 4D experience. For adults I recommend the Aerosmith ride... If you like rollercoasters that is!! Rides close if there is heavy rain but reopen quickly when rain stops. I was most looking forward to the summer of Marvel stuff. Unless you are willing to queue for 2 hours before the main indoor show starts (yes 2 hours) you will not get to see it. I didn't :(. There is another smaller outdoor show frequently during the day and the Guardians of the galaxy dance off which is corny but fun. Don't stand at the front unless you want to dance on stage!! Also forget captain America meet and greet. Or incredibles. Unless you are super lucky. You need the lineberty app (available in your app store) to book a slot and that slot goes within a few seconds of opening daily at 0945. They do not keep any slots for people who just show up even if the line is dead or there are no shows which was frustrating. Disappointed at the above but generally the park is OK for younger guests. Friendly staff also help. Highly recommend the inventions dinner with the characters. Food was nice (buffet) and characters are great without the need to queue. Get to meet around 5 of them. Can upgrade your half board vouchers but BOOK EARLY. Call in advance if you can. Make sure you catch the daily parade around 1730 as it is excellent. As well as the 11pm closing show on the castle. Finally if you want to do the princess pavilion get there EARLY. Queues peak at 90 mins and are generally minimum 50 mins. You only get to meet one princess for 5 mins or so after queueing. VERY expensive to eat there... Even with half board vouchers. All in all its OK but don't go just for the Marvel stuff. Unless you are happy to queue...There is also a place in the castle where you can 'make' your own glass wand. Expensive but good quality wand. Had a great time but the Marvel problems and a few rides being down for naintainance mean I only can give 3 stars. ","Neutral"
"Six of us, four adults and two children have just spent four days at the Park. This is not a cheap holiday and so we were most disappointed to find that at least six of the attractions were closed and one we were on broke down. This meant there were fewer things to see and the queueing time was made worse. The food offer is monotonous, overpriced, and again led to long waits. There were no smoking zones so people were able to light up everywhere that was not an attraction. Having said that it is all about the kids and they were happy. The attractions may not now be sophisticated enough for teenagers.","Neutral"
"Went for 3 days and had an excellent time. The weather was  35cTips, take your own water bottles and snacks sandwiches, you'll save a small fortune. The park could do with doubling the amount of water fountains and street vendors. The Disneyland Park I would say is more the adult and Studios more toward the kids side. The shows are good. I would recommend the stunt car, marvel avengers (tip   queuing starts an hour before the performance). Tower Hotel was very good, Aerosmith rollacoaster (very strong g forces), Mickey's magic show (kids loved most of the shows). The Star Wars Hyperspace, Buzz Lightyear, all good. The Star Tours was really good. We went on there 3 times, it's a shame they have 3 or 4 slightly different stories and they played 3 out of the 4 dubbed in French. Warning there is one with JarJar (shudder). Should play them in the original version. More good rides than bad. RC Racer. Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones etcProbably can avoid (and save time) on Armageddon, Art of Disney. The Studio tram tour not worth the long wait (tip   go at the end of the day with no queue).Tip   some of the rides have single rider queues which appear shorter waiting times, I saw groups of people going into these but the actual queues where quicker. The Crush Turtle one comes to mind. Good ride but no fastpass. The street stalls at the studios were easier to find for food and beer! Queues not big. Overall, staff very nice, shops expensive, you can pre book meetings with the characters (they won't stop and have a picture if they are walking through the park). A little overrated I'd say (maybe the cynic in me)   I think the kids loved the pool in the hotel more! Haha. But it's done and probably won't go back anytime soon. If I do it will be Florida. You will have a good time.","Positive"
"I was hesitant about DLP, having been to both WDW and DL CA, but I loved it! It's still Disney magic and still a happy, wonderful place. Just keep in mind that you're in Europe, not sunny Florida California, so you're surrounded by Europeans who smoke and don't know how to queue properly. The parks are smaller and I think the rides are not as good (some don't have any commentary because of the languages some are partially in French), but it's still a wonderful place to visit and I had a great time. I would go back!","Positive"
"Recently visited Disneyland for 2 days. The crowds were horrific   people everywhere. I used Ridemax and nothing worked   Fastpasses barely helped. At one point the wait time at thePeter Pan ride in Storyland was 100 minutes. Really?! This seems like child abuse   Disney corporation. The crowd size needs to be limited which I know will never happen   corporate greed! This was last trip to Disney for our family so at least 4 less people.","Negative"
"Fun great little Disney metro train to the park nice entrance in. Usual 'lands'. Hard to find your way around, seemed to be a few dead ends.  Hardly any rides at all. Smaller and less impressive than disneyland Paris and obviously Florida!  Didn't deal with...More","Neutral"
"I had a sense of nostalgia and came back to DL for a visit on Mon 28 Sep 09... It was so, so amazingly crowded, thousands of strollers and almost impossible to actually take any rides, although I did use the Fastpass for Indiana Jones & the Haunted Mansion with the cool holiday overlay... I first came here in 1979, then again through the end of the 80's and the early 90's, and there was a time when Disneyland had off peak times, when ride lines were sometimes short. I suppose those times are over. Nothing wrong with that of course. In terms of the Disney magic, I didn't sense much in the faces of cast members who looked hot, bothered, and quite obviously frazzled by dealing with the massive crowds. One cast member on the Disneyland Railway was quite rude to a whole bunch of people with small children waiting for a train. I've never quite seen anything like it before. But there you are... I hope you find the magic you're looking for   I'm just sharing my personal experience!","Neutral"
"This Disney park is small compared with Disney parks over the world. Not much choice of games.  Suggest to add Florida 4D Toy Story game, and digital games of Epcot.","Neutral"
"The last time I was here was in 2008, so please keep in mind that I don't have the most up to date review. There is so much to do here you will need days and partially it's because you have to stand in very long lines for literally everything. Bathroom, food, rides, line to get in, etc. That's the biggest downside to this place. Sure they have fast pass, but it's still a good portion of your day to wait. There's a lot to see even if you don't ride on anything and a lot of great food if you like to eat. Normally I would give a place that has extremely long waits and is severely overpriced to get in a 3 star but this is Disneyland...it deserves at least a 4 :) There are lots of great memories for me here. Stay for the fireworks show or leave and come back. It's worth it!I also recommend that for parents, you should rent your stroller there. Singles and doubles are available. It's much easier and you don't need to worry about your personal stroller getting stolen. :)","Positive"
"The park is really amazing, so many different things to do. Wonderful shops, lots of rides, parades, meeting Disney characters, different activities, the atmosphere is wonderful and the fireworks show is amazing. Plenty to do for children of all ages, plenty of places to grab a bite, had a wonderful time in this park, so much to see and do.","Positive"
"This was our first time here. We had a good time, but I much preferred Disney's California Adventure Park to this park. Long lines and high prices.","Neutral"
"Beautiful parks, but it has many outdated attractions.The parks are organized to make more money.Parents and children can stand in an hour long row to pose in 10 seconds with Dark Vader or a Princes. After this hour long queue you almost feel obliged to take a photo of 17 euros !! to buy because you have not waited for it for hours.The price quality ratio is hard to find.The food is fat, cold and overprised. We paid in the park 36 euros for 2 burgers with fries. And 80 euros in Disneyvillage (cold junk food in a crowded noisy place).Nice park, but never again.Efteling in the Netherlands is a cheaper and more beautiful park.Het zijn mooie parken, maar het telt veel verouderde attracties.De parken zijn ingedeeld om nog meer geld afhandig te maken.Ouders en kinderen kunnen in een urenlange rij staan, om in 10 seconde te poseren met Dark Vader of een Princes. Na deze urenlange wachtrij voel je je bijna verplicht om een foto van 17 euro!! te kopen, omdat je niet voor niks uren het gewacht. De prijs kwaliteitsverhouding is ver te zoeken. Het eten is vet, koud en overprijst. We waren in het park 36 euro kwijt voor 2 hamburgers met friet. En 80 euro lichter in Disneyvillage (lauwe junkfood in een herrietent).Leuk park, maar nooit meer. Efteling in Nederland is een goedkoper, en mooier park.","Neutral"
"Visited Disneyland after several years. Not much was new and several rides were out of service. Huge disappointment!","Neutral"
"This is my second visit to Paris after visiting in 2005. Since then I've been seen to visit Florida California and Tokyo Disney parks unfortunately Paris is still nowhere near up to scratch especially when you compare it to other Disney parks. Firstly The Good The Castle in Paris is definitely the best. The Disney team really comes to town with it and it's made one of the people in castles to play around the world complete with working dragon. The park also has said he can no longer see it any other disney parks. This camera should be unique.However there is still an awful lot that Disney need to do to bring this park and this resort up to standard.The staff were interesting you would get announcements telling you no selfie sticks, infront of staff members were plenty of people using them even worse after the announcements the staff members still ignored it. We saw staff members just stood around having conversations ignoring guests and no interaction with them other Disney parks this will not go on. My personal favourite was seeing the distance last number trying to chat up the young lady is waiting to see a show an extremely professional attitude to working at Disney. However the saddest part was seeing images of the rides. On Monday we were the first people on Peter Pan yet they were still a sweet stuck to the support bar and it was sticky obviously not cleaned, dumbbell had cracks on the Ride buttons missing from the ride paintwork chips and cracks away this would not happen in Florida it would have been repaired quickly. When arriving in the morning it was obvious that been no no cleaning as they were still a litter on the floor in the night before again this would not happen in the US parks. If you're a vegetarian you'll struggle they do sell salads but at    8 each it is not vaue for money. The sad thing is the spark so much potential it is let down by lots of little things the staff a lot of care and really the fact it seems to be unloved. If Disney get their act together this can be one of the best parks until then it's still second rate","Neutral"
"Our first day was the Fri 6th May which was just hell ...never have I seen so many people in one place!!!.....have since found out it was a public holiday in France ...but it could of been an absolute disaster if something had happened in the park!.....we left after 2 hours with 3 very disappointed children. Luckily we were staying at the Davey Crockett Ranch a 10 min drive away so went back to our cabin & enjoyed the rest of the day there in the pool & Ranch.The following day we went in at 8am (with Disney hotel pass)& managed to get on quite a few rides before the hoards of people arrived at 10am!!! again we left early & went back to the Ranch as the crowds are just too much! Another day we went in early ,popped back to the ranch & then came back in for the Parade at 5.30pm & Fireworks at 10.30 which for us were the highlight of this holiday.Much of the park is closed at the moment due to refurb & they are doing good deals to get people in ....unless you love ridiculous crowds ,standing around for hours waiting for rides of which there aren't too many...then I would give this a miss.","Neutral"
"Had such an amazing trip with a big group of our family!!  So many wonderful memories made that we will cherish forever!  Make sure you stop on Main Street for the old fashioned ice cream!! So good!","Positive"
"Long lines, expensive food, nothing new and where was Mickey??? We went to Disneyland 5 years earlier and nothing new. What was missing were the characters. Hardly saw any characters and when we did they were only out for a short amount of time. Overpriced and not worth a second visit.","Negative"
"We've just come back from a couple of days at Eurodisney. I agree with a previous review writer that to the staff at Eurodisney its just a job, whereas at Orlando they do the job because they actually like to do it. That's not belittling all the staff at Paris as some where very helpful, albeit they seemed in the minority.We weren't warned that some of the rides were closed and the fast path tickets ran out early afternoon. Additionally we couldn't get a Park Guide in English as they had all ran out! We booked our tickets over the internet direct with Disney which failed to arrive and we waited 40 minutes to be given replacements on the day. Having been to Disney at Florida early this year perhaps gave us an unfair comparison.Whilst writing   does anyone know what the Halloween song was that was played?We didn't feel that the Park had the same Disney feel as Florida, true it was Halloween there but you could have been anywhere. There were very few characters going around.Having said all that   of course we will go again!!!","Negative"
"We   ve been to Disney Land many times. It was the same as always. I noticed it wasn   t quite as sparkling clean as I remember but it   s not dirty or anything. We went on Tuesday May 16th and it was super crowded. Pirates was closed. Space Mountain was closed for awhile and scheduled to open in a couple hours and the line was super long. Thunder Mt. was a 70 minute wait according to the sign but it was longer. Small World sign said 20 minutes but it was 45 min. It wasn   t that hot but if it was and you had to stand in line all that time it would be miserable. There are other things to do where you don   t have to stand in long lines like the monorail and the train and you can see the sites. I noticed it was about 23 bucks for a sandwich. Bring your Mickey and Minnie ears which everyone wears. ","Positive"
"I was so exited to go on this trip. I arrived to the park with my 9 year old daughter and this was her birthday gift. She could not wait to get inside. When we got into the park Main Street was all she enjoyed. Every ride we tried to get on broke down. We waited on ALL of the main rides and they all had technical problems. 12 hours at this park and all I did was stand in lines for nothing and watched the parade fireworks. Awefull. Buyers beware. ","Negative"
"Everything in the Disneyland Park and Disney Village is HUGELY expensive and I don't believe we can purely blame the    Euro rate at the present time although it should be bourne in mind. Prices are really bumped up for the captive park users. We paid   5 for a small cup of hot chocolate and our cheapest meal for four during our four day stay in December was a McDonalds that came in at   34 (and included three  value  meals). We don't mind paying good money for a decent meal but there is little to offer in the resort that represents good value for money, acutally, NOTHING that represents good value for money.Also, is it just me, or is Planet Hollywood (located in the Disney Village) trapped in the early 1990's. My kids (7 and 13) wanted to go but with the likes of Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and the Lethal Weapon movies on the walls I felt that they wanted our money (18 Euros for a burger and a very small portion of fries) but they hadn't reinvested any of it in the resaturant for YEARS.......The furnishings are tired and dusty and twenty years out of date. Come on Planet Hollywood   get yourself into this century or we won't be going back.Disneyland Paris   great but an expensive holiday......having a  magical  time is very costly.....","Neutral"
"I am not a child anymore but i LOVED the place. It's the first time i had visited Disneyland and I was completely mesmerized. But a pair of Minnie Mouse ears and enjoy your day in this fairy tale! We went there at 11 and stayed until closing, they have great restaurants for lunch and desert shops for sweets&refreshments.","Positive"
"This was our second trip to Disneyland. We went 4 years ago when my daughter was 6 and my son 4. While we had a good time, I think she is growing too old. Many of the rides were too young for her. We enjoyed Calafornia Adventure much more. Both kids love rollercoasters and the madahorn just didn't do it for them. Don't get me wrong, we had fun, but I think we could have had more somewhere else. The lines did get really long and the pin trading thing is a racket. So I would recommend to someone with smaller children, stay on property and for a first timer.","Neutral"
"We went to Disneyland in July while it is VERY hot. It is not pleasant to walk around the park in the heat! But in the parade the characters did spray water onto the onlookers. Which was really nice. The rides were small and really for younger children. They had an African show which was really well done! The puppets and acting was excellent!","Neutral"
"Visited the park in mid May, supposedly before the start of summer break. The layout, ambience and reception at Anahiem was good but for a US$80 adult and $74 child ticket, I would expect to cover more of the park rather than to spend most of the time in queues. The Fastpass is a suppose to give you a designated time to come back but most of the popular rides would tell you to come back 6 8 hours later. The new attraction, Star Tours had a constant 200min waiting time and ran out of fastpasses. The Fantasmic viewing area was jammed packed by twilight and families were reporting to staff about space hoarding and reservations. The fire works was quite a spectacle but standing room only. One would have to raise your cam overhead to get a good pix or vid but then told by the back that you are blocking them. And all these on a weekday...I really can't imagine the experience over the weekend. Why can't such an established and successful organisation just limit the numbers to allow all guests to have a positive experience? That way, I would accompany friends and relatives to Disneyland for return visit. Now I dread the next one.","Negative"
"Lovely entertainment for all ages a very well organized amusement park . The staff very professional friendly and well trained . It was a unique experience and made the most of it as we stayed in it for 4 days . Both my teenage kids loved it .","Positive"
"My family visited Eurodisney in July. Queues were long and wait times underestimated. The rides once on them were good. My advice would be to buy a Fastpass during peak periods, even though the regular entry cost is high. If you are buying food, try an early or late lunch but avoid 12 1:30pm unless you want to wait in yet another queue. My children (6 and 9y) enjoyed it but not as much as several other places we visited, including Legoland (Billund) and the Eiffel Tower.I have been to other Disneys and found my experiences there (though not recent) much better.","Neutral"
"I got the three day So Cal Pass for a very good price. I was excited they brought it back since it wasn't available in 2013. I see why they brought it back though. So many of the rides were closed! What a disappointment! The park gets incredibly packed now and the prices are ridiculous. I won't come back in a very long time. ","Neutral"
"Disneyland itself is without a doubt a magical place! Starting on a positive, I really enjoyed when the castle lit up at night standing there looking out on it on the bridge with my boyfriend  very romantic, if it wasn't the fact it was the first time abroad with my man I don't think I would have seen it as such an adventure! We went on the trip with coach innovations  it was only   90 each for the trip and entry to park so we thought it would be worth it, however I must say it wasn't great! It rained all day, it was wet, cold, tiring weekend and the park just doesn't have enough shter   warm points  other than gift shops that are soooo expensive!! we only managed to get on the  finding nemo  ride which was an amazing ride  however we queued for 2 hours and were freezing! Staff didn't really seem friendly and were not many to be seen, didn't see anyone dressed up in character. The food really WAS NOT great!    20 for a burger and Chips   cold and inedible.Would maybe return in the summer  but even wrapped up it was unbearably freezing!Christmas parade was lovely! but not long enough.I think the fact we spent from 9am to 11pm was way too long !","Neutral"
"this Disneyland had a nice mix of rides. there are many people who say that is a very small Disneyland for kids but I didn't find this to be the caseGrizzly gulch, RC racer, space mountain are great thrill rides. grizzly gulch is a great ground hugging coaster with great elements and storyRC racer is a great ride with lots of air time for a compact ride, don't under estimate itspace mountain was its usual thrilling self with lot of effectsmy favourite ride was mystic manor, the story was really interesting and the ride had amazing effects and timing they really made it come to life, its one of the best themed rides I've ever been onthere is the usual Disney staple rides like small world, autotopia, river cruise, mad hatters tea cupsall the lands are very well themed as standard by Disney and the toy story play land is the epitome of this. it is a very immersive with lots of detail even in things like the structure of the shops, there's lots to spotthe end of the night firework show is spectacular and worth staying the whole day for","Positive"
"Yes it's not as big as other Disney Parks, the castle is smaller but it is not a small world beyond that and you can easily spend 6 8 hours wandering round...we did and enjoyed every minute. It's typical disney with many rides you will have seen before but some we hadnt seen (Although our experience is limited to Paris). We got excited by the Philarmagic 4D screening, Winnie the pooh ride, The Lion King festival and best of all Mystic Manor which we would gladly queue for again and again...not scary just fun!As for queuing we arrived at 10.30 and grabbed a fastpass for Winnie the pooh but chanced our luck for everything else. It was a hot day and there were ots of people but the lonest we queued was 20 minutes!!! Not saying that will always happen but if you are there early and you plan well you will spend more time having funTop tip: book in advance from the disney website and take the credit card you booked with to redeem your tickets. You get a reference number but we didn't need it. When you get to the park simply go to the machines tucked away on the righthand side of the entrance, use your credit card and grab your tickets...none of the hour long queues, we walked straight in! Get there for 10.00 and plan your route to get fastpasses and you are in for a fun day.","Positive"
"Good...1. The theme park is well maintained. Facility is accessible and clean.2. Staff are friendly and well presented, professional.3. Close to airport and Disney styled subway is fantastic.Bad...1. Admission is too expensive.2. Packed with nasty visitors. Queue jumping happens all the time. There are nasty people purposely enter your view when taking photos. Someone worse even dare to tell you move away (unfriendly) because they want to take pictures. Completely disasters!!3. Games are not exciting enough. I guess it's because they need to care about younger kids.4. Food is expensive. Although you would expect that but management can control it better.I believe it can be demographic issue, since I never come across all these bad things in American and Japanese Disneyland.Good luck.","Negative"
"I planned a trip to southern california around disney and it happened to be the place we liked the least. I had the most miserable, tiring, hot day of my life. I went on a weekday to try and avoid the crowds somewhat. But 1.5  hour waits for the big rides. 45 minute waits for the kiddie rides. Lines to eat. Lines to go to the bathroom. I expected lines. But we barely did anything all day. We used the fastpasses as much we could. But standing in line all day in full sun when it is 100  degrees drove me nuts. Disney, please can you please get some more benches in the park. But what topped it all off was when i stood in line for about 1 hour we were the next group to ride, they told us they had to shut the ride down for the parade. So we waited in line for nothing. Also, when my fastpass time for star trek ride came, the ride was stopped for maitanence because it had problems. Terrible terrible park. I am sure i just had bad luck and the hot did not help. But it was insane and i will necer want to come back.","Negative"
"Excellent.  We should have scheduled even more time there.  Only disappointment was that several major rides (Matterhorn, Indiana Jones, Submarines, Rocky Mountain Rail) were closed.  Bring some food, because the park's leaves a lot to be desired.","Positive"
"We had been very excited to be visiting Disneyland and had been discussing which characters we were hoping to have photos taken with. The day we visited was a Sunday in October. Not one character was strolling the park   not one! We saw a stationary Maleficent and could have queued for a photo but didn't bother. It was pleasant walking around the park and very clean of course but became very crowded after about 11.00am. The queues for any ride were over an hour at anytime of the day so we only got to do four rides over the whole day. All up I would not recommend it at all. Very very expensive for not a lot of fun.","Negative"
"The train ride out is fantastic. Quick and efficient and so easy to find. The park itself was extremely clean and all the staff were welcoming. It was a fantastic day out, but definitely one for families with young children. Don't go if you are hoping for big rides as there aren't any. My friend and I enjoyed our day and would recommend it for a visit.","Neutral"
"I'll start off by acknowledging that the production quality of Disney is first rate. The cast members were wonderful; warm friendly and very helpful. However, as great as that is, here are the negatives: Overcrowded, even on  off peak days.  Wait to get get your bag checked.  Wait to get your body scanned.  Wait to enter park. Rush to get fast pass. Rush to get in line for ride. Stand in line for one hour, enjoy 5 minute ride. After waiting in long lines, rides break down. (Happened to us 3 times) Dodge constant wave of people and strollers.  Rush to get next fast pass. Wait in line again. Wait in slow line for drinks. Wait in line for food. Search for tables to sit & eat. Hunt for restrooms. Wait in line for restrooms. Oh yeah, lots of waiting and fighting crowds. I get it! If the these things don't bother you, Disneyland can be totally worth it. However, I really don't want to hustle & strategize on vacation. It was too much work & stress to truly enjoy the   magic.","Neutral"
"We went as early was we could (which wasn't very early considering how late my mom always is) and it was so crowded that we could barely move. It turned out there was a parade, and soon the crowd dispersed and we went on the Matterhorn. The wait was about 20 minutes, and the ride was very long, and especially better considering you were in a mountain. Other rides we went on were the log ride, which gets you completely soaked, the haunted house, and a submarine ride with a long line. Space Mountain was probably my favorite ride, followed by the Matterhorn and Thunder MOuntain. BUT BEWARE OF LONG LINES","Positive"
"Disney land park is a great attraction don't miss it!! children & adult u will enjoy it.one day isn't enough to visit all the park but its too expensive to go twice (80 euro per person).i advise you to visit it during week days so you will face less traffic.if u wanna buy items with Disney characters its your place you will not find them anywhere else in Paris !","Positive"
"Went there with our two kids (one was 4 and one was 2 ) in July. It was great to catch the subway to Disneyland. My 4 year old was very excited to see Mickey mouse' ears on the train. We only got the one day tickets. But we think you probably need two days to see everything there. One thing we think is really disappointing is for some shows, you have to go to the places and make a reservation first thing once you arrive at Disneyland. Otherwise you won't be able to see the show. You can probably still go in if you are happy to line up for 2 hours. As we traveled in July, it was stinky hot. There was no way for us to line up for 2 hours to see the show with one toddler and one 4 year old. So in the end we didn't end up going to many shows or rides. The Disney Paint the Night show was fantastic but it was a little bit short. Our advice is if you want to go there, you really need to plan it in advance and know where to go and what to see.","Neutral"
"Nice buildings in disney style. Only a few disney figures. We only saw Mickey, Miney, Pluto and some of the princesses like cinderella and one other. I expected more from the Disney stories like the family duck, goody, newer stories. Toys r us etc.Some attractions where you have to wait a long time before you can go in. Everywhere you are overloaded with souvenir stores. There where too many in my opinion. No buildings from the movies.Try to go in a better season. There was a lot of maintanance.The park was clean.

"An otherwise forgettable first visit to Disneyland Paris was salvaged by a trip on the fantastic Aerosmith Rock'n Roll Rollercoster tucked away in the Walt Disney Studio Park. The ride is fully enclosed in a hanger, so on arrival you have no idea what to expect. We queued for only 10 minutes (compared to up to 50 minutes for other, inferior  attractions ) and only once inside we were able to see the cars being launched at what appeared to be an incredible speed. After take off I can say that the acceleration was like nothing else I have ever experienced. The ride was utterly terrifying, with loop the loop and worse, all at very fast speed. The initial acceleration from take off will remain in my memory for ever. As for the rest of Dinseyland Paris   ruined by the queues and totally forgettable. Terra Mitica at Benidorm beats it hands down.","Negative"
"If you grew up with Disneyland, it just doesn't matter   its still Disneyland. Sure, it's tired and crowded and hot and a little careworn on the edges   but it is still DISNEYLAND!! Even after 3 days, we rarely make it to California Adventure   we just keep going back to the 'real' Disneyland!For those who grew up in locales other than Southern California, or have seen other Disneylands   well, give the grandmother a break! The Engineers have made an art form out of waiting in line, and the Fast Pass is great!","Positive"
"There is no doubt that any parent would feel that the money is worth it when they see the sparkle in their daughters as they see Disney princesses. However, overall we were disappointed with Disney Land Park. Having recently been to Universal Studios in Singapore, we'd had high expectations. Unfortunately the age of Disney Paris is showing and the lack of modern technology in the rides is evident. You could overlook the dated nature of the place, as they clearly can't be updating it all the time. But what we could not overlook is an overt attempt to gouge every last cent out of you. When it came to lunch time, there were no simple stalls to be seen where you could get a hot dog or a sandwich (we eventually saw one at 5pm). You are effectively forced to eat in one of their over priced restaurants. We settled for their  fine American all you can eat buffet.  For EUR30 per adult and EUR17 for a child above 3 years of age you got to eat very average food   oh and ONE glass of soft drink! For those of you with young children you will probably share the pain of even getting your children to eat (and don't think of your kids simply eating what you bring with you if you want to go in   they charge you at the door as you walk in!). This was after a poor experience on the ticketing. We booked the Mini Ticket which allows access to both Parks in Low season for a day. Unfortunately we had to postpone our trip due to an emergency and had to move it to high season. Their website tells you that you can top up if you want to use the ticket in high season. What they don't tell you is that you don't top up to the two park high season price   you have to pay much more. So be it, but it would be better if the website is a little more transparent on what it means to top up. I only found out after a few calls to their call centre in Paris   it's not shown on the site. All in all, the kids will always remember that they've been to Disneyland, but it would be good if the experience was improved as time goes on so that parents feel it is worth the price.","Negative"
"As a 26 year old adult, newly married on his honeymoon I was absolutely impressed with this magical land. This was my first visit and was thinking that it would be a kids paradise, not entirely true. Not only did I have the time of my life but saw other people my age enjoying the disneyland experience. Anyone who has an ounce of joy in their hearts will absolutely love this place. Great dining, fun rides, wonderful staff and plenty of memories!!!","Positive"
"Even for kids Disneyland has become a bit like hard work. It's overcrowded, expensive and at this time of the year unbearably hot. Space Mountain was closed for renovation which was a great disappointment for our 12 year old son. Fast passes are a must for the popular rides.","Positive"
"Not worth it! Long queues, especially in the afternoon, up to 2 hours!! This was mid week and most main rides closed for repair. Best to pack your lunch too as food poor and expensive. Many better ways to spend a day in Paris with the kids.","Negative"
"Maybe it's because without the aid of young children the Disneyland Experience is like Marmite, you either love it or hate it. Well maybe hate is to strong a word. We sytayed for 4 nights and 5 days and after day 3 i would have been happy to jump on the train and go back home. All the big rides done, some of the small rides done and the wallet was nearly empty through the expence of being in the Disney bubble. If you have young children the appeal is the Disney characters and processions. We took a 10, 12 and 15 year old and the interest in processions, Disney characters was further back than going on all the thrill rides and watching the stunt shows. Tower of Terror, Areosmiths Roller costers, Space mountain, Thunder mountain and Star Tours were much more favoured over chasing characters for a picture or seeing a prade. I have now been to Disney Florida and Paris and would rate the lay out of the Paris better, not as many parks but the Disney Village, Studios and main park are all right next to each other. The cost for eating is way to much, the maintenance on some of the rides   a little less impressive than the Amercian counter parts (Aerosmith Rock n Rolla is not half as impressive when it doesn't have the music playing for several days). We stayed at one of the Hotels recomended by Disney with the free shuttle bus (you are now captured in the Disney bubble), with the hotel swimming pool and ball pool on offer the kids spent hour playing in these each evening, All that said we had a nice time, but wouldn't do it again (couldn't afford it).","Neutral"
"We took our 4 year old Daughter for her Birthday 21 22 23 October. Caught train from Ashford and was very a simple and relaxed way to travel. Got off train at the park and got rid of luggage which was transferred straight to our Disney Hotel. Entered park about 2pm and It was raining when we got there so queues were at a mimimum and we managed to do quite a lot of rides in the 5 hours we had in the park. Tried to book an evening meal at City Hall but the computer system had gone down so we were told to do it at our hotel when we checked in. Checked in our hotel (Newport Bay) fairly quickly but were told that the earliest we could have a table for dinner was 8.45pm! We told them we needed to eat earlier as our Daughter was really tired and they found us a table at the Sequoia Lodge Hotel. We wish we hadn't bothered as the food was terrible and struggled to find anything we liked. We had the pre paid vouchers which I would recommend as they do save a lot of money but maybe avoid buffet restaurants and stick to table service. The second day which was my Daughter's Birthday was a lot more relaxed. We got to breakfast for 7.30am (any later and you would be waiting for ages). The breakfast was basic but you could get toast and cereals so not too bad. There were characters in the reception area which was great as everyone queued and waited their turn, unlike in the park. We got to the park for about 8.30pm and did quite a few rides with no queues, although a lot of rides don't open until 10am. We managed to do most rides in the morning and even meet a few characters. We then went to Rainforrest Cafe for a special lunch and the place was more or less empty at 12.30. Food was really good but pricey, a two course meal for 2 adults and 1 child with drinks was 60 Euros. We then went to the Studios which is a lot quieter than the main park and we did a few rides and shows. Stitch LIve and Playhouse Disney were brilliant and my Daughter loved them. We had pre booked a Birthday Party with the characters which was well worth the money. We turned up to Luckey Nugget Saloon at 5pm and were seated in the middle section and helped ouselves to a selection of cakes, buns and sweets. There was more then enough for everyone and the staff kept replenishing them. There were a lot of really good characters present and they came to everyone's table in turn. There were certain parents that couldn't wait their turn and kept taking their children to other peoples tables which was really annoying. We waited until the end when most people had left and my Daughter had the characters mostly to herself and even danced on stage with Mickey. We made the mistake to going to McDonalds at 7pm when the park closed and my husband queued to be served for nearly an hour. The meal cost 16 Euros so if you are on a budget this is a good place to eat, just not at 7pm!The final day was a Friday and a Halloween Special day when the park stayed open until midnight. We missed breakfast as we were so tired but still got to the park for 9am. When we walked in the park we knew it was going to be one of those days! It was much busier then the other two days and the queues for rides were massive already. Luckily there was only 3 rides we hadn't managed to do the other two days so we aimed to get them done. My Daughter wanted to go back on Pirates of the Caribean ride as that was one of her favourites, but when we got there were informed it had broken down. We went to the Snow White ride and queued for 30 minutes and then were told that was out of order. We also queued for Cassey Junior for 30 minutes and got to the front of queue when that also broke down. We wandered around a bit as all the queues were huge and decided to try and meet the Princess near the castle. We stood for 30 minutes waiting for her to get round to us but all the French and German people just pushed in which is one of the biggest complaints about the park. In the afternoon we went back to the studios and did a few more shows and chilled out for a bit, it was still a lot quieter than the main park.By 6pm I was really looking forward to coming home and the magic had definately gone for me, I would hate to be at the park in the summer holidays it must be chaos!Our hotel was basic and would have been a lovely hotel 15 years ago, it was mainly clean but looked like it hadn't changed since it had opened. It was convenient and functional but that was about all. The park was a lot smaller then I expected and and can't be compared to Florida. My Daughter loved meeting the characters, but rude foreign people spoiled it for her by pushing and shoving! The shows and parades were brilliant, but the food is mostly terrible and so overpriced. Go to the train station shop where everything is a lot cheaper and take a bottle of orange squash with you and fill up water bottles at the water fountains, it saved us such a lot of money! I am glad we went but would save the extra to go to Florida next time.","Neutral"
"Disney is always magical but this trip to Disneyland was a disappoint. From the dirty restrooms to the lack of helpful staff members, the litter on the ground, the high prices and the long lines left me feeling weary! True that the major attractions have fast pass availability, one has to zig zag the park to make use of them. Parking was easy enough and shuttle to park was no problem, there was some confusion in finding the right queue to get back to the right shuttle to the parking lot we used.","Neutral"
"Me and my wife visited the park the day after Christmas. After reading some bad reviews and already visiting Walt Disney World in Orlando several times when I was younger I wasn't expecting much here other than a better looking Alton Towers.I have to say I was really impressed. I have been to many Disney Parks and Walt Disney World in Florida has always been my favorite however Disneyland Paris is not far off. The theming for Christmas was excellent, food was delicious, the rides were great, all the staff seemed to enjoy what they were doing and were always on hand to help.So, I hate to say it as apart from this the Park really had been fantastic and would of earned a 5 star rating..... the toilets, no matter which one we used they were not stocked with supplies and were not clean we were there for two days and did not see one member of staff clean any of the toilets in either the Magic Kingdom or Walt Disney Studios.","Positive"
"Good old Disney   it does the job of entertaining children and adults alike. The fireworks show in the evening is a real highlight and worth waiting until the park closes. The special effects are amazing.However, the food is insanely expensive. Honestly, how can they justify 35 Euros for 3 hotdogs with drinks and 2 portions of fries?","Positive"
"If you are going to go to Disneyland, wait until you are in your 60s (by this age, you have learned that patience is a virtue). Or, rent out the entire park to yourself. Anyway, let's start at the beginning, we walk up to a lady behind a bullet proof window with a hole shaped like Mickey mouses head. We tell her that my son is turning 3 today so she tells us we have to pay full price for him. I tried to be nice and even funny but no dice. This woman has worked here since the day Disney opened, and she likely gave birth to Walt Disney himself. She's seen it all and she doesn't care. So I bought 3 tickets, went to a different counter changed my story and got my son in for free. I had warned my kids of the lineups and I made sure I took snacks and water and anything that I could possibly hold on my back. I downloaded the app to tell me wait times attractions etc. It didn't help. We went on about 4 rides and waited in line to meet Mickey, rapunzel and goofy, and then we stopped for lunch. At that point my six year old made an executive decision to go back to the hotel and play in the pool. So we cut our losses and left. Later that night we went back but still, it wasn't for us. We are personally  homebodies  so if you are like us, and don't want to hang out with 600,000 people I'd say skip Disneyland, go to the Disney STORE and call it a day.","Negative"
"Here is the first tip.... If going for two or more days get an Annual pass. Not sure about other European countries but an annual pass costs about the same as buying a two day pass in the UK. Couple of block out dates but look it up online. Disneyland this year on the days we went had stuff broken for hours. Thunder Mountain was off for an entire afternoon, space mission was off for the same arvo and the entire following morning. Some of the Fast Passes weren't working. OK kids, this is the trick... Check dates for block out but get a Fantasy annual pass. You can get in at 8am not 10am. Spend a couple of hours getting on whatever is working without major queues.","Neutral"
"Who doesn   t know about Disneyland!!! This place to me is better than DisneyWorld. It is smaller but way better rides. Always a great time. Get the Maxpass so you do not have to wait online. Get Fastpasses right to your phone. Mickey is waiting!","Positive"
"We went to California adventure park and were so impressed. It was magical and could not wait to get to disneyland. Once inside Disneyland it was terrible, old no characters nor were there any professional photos. If you have little daughters granddaughter that love disney princess then recommend. Definitely would recommend california adventure park.","Negative"
"Quite frankly it's hard to say it's the happiest place on earth when the average wait time for a 60 second ride is 45 minutes. And we didn't even try to go on rides that were popular, those wait times were rediculous. One of the very few positives about Disneyland are the characters and getting pictures with your child with those characters. Each day there are times and locations of where those pictures can be obtained. However, the character are rarely there and they are never there at the times that they say they will be. If you see a character and want a picture, sprint to try and get in line. Odds are that if you see the character when they first come out, you will get a picture. If however, you see the character already in he process of taking pictures, the line has already been cut off and you won't get a picture. Simply put, the character pictures are a huge part of the appeal for my son, he loves the Disney characters, but we can't get him a picture because of the reasons listed above. There are too few characters on a whole and their limited availability makes the issue much worse. I do understand the issue of someone having to dress up in a costume and that it's not pleasant, I support them not being in those costumes for extended periods of time. I'm just saying, get some more people to play those roles so that people can actually get pictures with them.Disneyland park is severely outdated and has ridiculous wait times. California adventure is more wide open but is limited in their offerings to young children. For a 2 1 2 year old, you can do the whole park in less than 2 hours, there just isn't a lot available to them. My son loved the Disney Jr. Show, I highly recommend it for parents of children that like doc mcstuffins, Sofia the first and the Mickie mouse club house shows. Put simply, the is insufficient value at these parks to warrant the enormous expense that people are asked to pay. I would not recommend anyone go to either severely overcrowded park.","Negative"
"......so many rides were broken down, out of commission, breaking down (3 times for us while waiting!!!) or Fastpass (a strange concept) had run out.Why oh why can't you buy Front of Line like other parks?These 2 parks need serious maintenance to recover the Disney experience.Poor old Walt must be spinning in his grave.The only reason I have awarded the 3rd star is because the evening parade and fireworks were excellent.Also, why allow people to bring their own food, but then charge sky high prices at the food outlets? If the prices were reasonable, more people would eat there, surely?","Neutral"
"We stayed for 4 days and experienced 6 breakdwns of attrations. Unlucky? This is not what I expect from a facility such as this.Staff were helpful but all could not provide adeqaute information Required a complaint to the Management office, be prepared to queue and be 'sorted ' by the door staff!!!!Resulted in free passes and queue beater access","Negative"
"I visit Disney most years at the beginning of December. This year it was very evident how scaled back everything was Smaller and less fantastic parades. The same parade 3 times a day and very few characters in the park. Equally my kids used to love seeing the characters in the hotels at breakfast this was stopped in October I was told. I think they need to remember that Disney can be magical but I have to say this year didn't feel that way at all","Negative"
"I grew up watching Disney but things have changed much since Walt Disney died. It has become a marketing scheme. The park lacked real creativity that it use to have and billions of Disney items were for sell everywhere. Castle was tiny compared to Disney World's. Lines were always nightmares, the kids did not seem overly thrilled after much money spent. Much money for what...","Negative"
"Although it can get pretty expensive you can   t come all the way to California and not experience the magic of Disney.Go early in the morning and get the Disney App, you pay 10 dollars but it   s worth every penny. You can get your fast passes this way and it allows you to have your picture taken by professional photographers in the park.Stay for the fireworks they are spectacular!!","Positive"
"Positives, we stayed in the hotel New York, took advantage of the hotel only access to the studios and got most of the rides done that morning before 10am! If you want breakfast take the first slot at 7am or forget about having breakfast as it's not worth the wait! The kids got to meet the characters in the hotel lounge, without having queue for hours (we were up very early though)We didn't get robbed this time we stayed at the the New York Disney!Negatives, the room safe was too small to take an iPad, so had to carry them about all day, as last time we stayed there our room was ransacked! So make sure you carry your valuables if you stay there!! The room was extremely dated and stale, obviously hasn't been redecorated since the building opened back in 1992! Room service menu is extremely limited, ok if you like pizza or curried bread sandwiches?? (You see my point) There are more adults in the park than children, and when the parade is on route the adults don't think twice about pushing kids out of the way to see! Watch out for rude locals pushing anything and anyone out of the way to get on rides, my 5 year old son experienced this treatment! It seems the park has gone downhill since our last experience 3 years ago at the same time of year revisiting! They have sacrificed a lot by cutting back on main attraction that people wish to experience on their visit to Disneyland! There were next to no characters in the park, the ones that were there you had to queue ages for! The ice rink had no ice and instead were giving out roller blades and in my opinion that is not the making of a winter wonderland that was described with ice skating!!! The high chaparral theatre ice skating show we have seen for the past 7 years seemed to be no longer running or advertised! The restaurants seemed to have staff cutbacks as we soon realised as we had a booking for walts restaurant for 2pm and didn't get seated till 2.40pm! Some of the main rides were shut randomly throughout our visit! The parks needs pulled into this century, we went to the EO theatre, I think they should rename this attraction the 'time machine' it so old I get better 3d on my tv at home!! The early opening on the Monday was a waste of time as there were only some of the rides open in fantasyland, so the queues were just as bad as ever! If your thinking of eating at planet Hollywood, the food is lovely but expect to be in the place for at least 3 hours for 1 course!!Pinocchio ride, if it's a 5 min queue go for it.... Anything longer it's NOT worth the wait unless you want completely let down for your time spent in the queue, only thing it was good for was sheltering from the rain! Overall, be warned its on the down, Walt would be spinning in his grave! If you want to keep the disney magic alive go to Florida!!","Negative"
"Our kids have been waiting for years to visit. We made a major investment getting there   and expensive it is. The positives were the happy and engaging scenery, the sweet staff and the well organized and clean place. The major negatives were the massive renovations, the closed and constantly malfunctioning rides (twice while waiting at Buzz Lightyear) and the amazing fact that people smoke everywhere regardless of kids. Disneyland has a no smoking policy with designated smoking areas, but does NOTHING to enforce this; no signs on entry, no no smoking signs inside and not a single staff member seen reminding people smoking right next to them. For a park for children, obsessed with cleanliness, that is truly sad. Other park; LEGOLAND, Universal Studios, etc have long sorted this out. Disneyland Paris, please enter this century: get signs up everywhere, make every staff member enforce and level fines for violations. Please.","Negative"
"We visited on the last day of the  medium  season, and I was really annoyed. Most of the good rides (e.g. roller coasters) were closed!Of course they would all open the next day, when it was High Season!The one roller coaster that was open had a 75 minute wait. This is not practical with kids. And the Fastpass was useless because all available slots were immediately booked up. It really depends what you want out of Disneyland Park ....If you want Disney ness then its great.If you want a theme park, go somewhere else! (For example, GardaLand in Italy is FAR better)Some negative notes: * Parking is expensive* Closed rides* Most of the character based attractions are outdated   my kids had no idea who most of the character were. E.g. Indiana Jones, Captain Nemo, Pirates of the Caribbean, Alice in wonderland, Dumbo ... Some positive notes: * Its spotless!* The food in the restaurants is quite good and not that expensive!* The fireworks show at the end was fantastic!* It's relatively good value ... esp when compared to a themepark where you have to pay for each ride!Some hints: * Bring lots of drinks ... the drinks are very expensive ... food is not too expensive.* Good shoes! Lots of walking* Get there early, but pace yourself. The queues disappear a couple of hours before closing. Do the good rides then, but don't be too tired by then : )* The fireworks show is just amazing!","Neutral"
"The buildings from cartoons I liked. The terrible waiting time to get on a ride. My kids waited 1 hour in line to get on a 90 seconds ride. The broken rides you expected to ride and they were broken, that I didn't like. Crowds were terrible there ought to be a limit how many people are allowed in.","Negative"
"It was alot to take in but overall we had a good time. The lines are ridiculous but like any other park. The shows were awesome","Positive"
"We took our children to Euro Disney about 24 years ago and had a good time. We returned on 20th February with our grandson after a long drive from London. A total waste of time and money. It is now a complete rip off and should be avoided. One hour, 20 minute queue for a 3 minute ride on the flying Dumbos (3 of the 16 pods out of commission). Best attractions such as Pirates of the Caribbean   Madhatter   s teacups closed (   for your future enjoyment   ). Most refreshment outlets closed. Only place to get warm was in the shops     all of them open! People were sitting on the ground outside the shops eating chips in the freezing cold. Despite advance tickets on a Times promotion you had to queue for an hour even to get into the park (only one window in three open). Attitude of staff:    We know it   s rubbish. We don   t care. We only work here. it   s not our fault   . On top of everything, no sign of Donald Duck or the others in the gang . . . the one thing our grandson had been promised. In the UK we probably would have a case for suing them for misrepresentation.","Negative"
"So I give this a 3 rating and the reason are below...it   s Disneyland it   s exciting and everyone lives Disney. It   s the 2nd time Iv been but the first time was 6 years ago. We can for Halloween specially so we were expecting cold and rain and it didn   t really spoil our trip. The look of the place was outstanding (all Halloween) my son 11 was amazed. We managed to see a few characters (luckily buzz was free as we walked past) we waited around 30 mins for Donald and nearly 2hrs for jack skellington (expected as its was Halloween) just be warned you queue for every little thing in Disneyland. Fast pass was a good thing but you can only fast pass one ride at a time which is a shame! Everyone is rude! Everyone pushed and shoved to get first no matter where or what. It got so bad I would say that ruined our experience. We were let down by the Halloween night also, we paid   160 extra on top of the holiday cos to have Halloween night at Disneyland and I wouldn   t bother again. Nothing much changed to during the days, they didn   t have sweets for the kids to trick or treat which I did I expect, they had buzz as a dj and a few other little things but really that   s it! They organisation what awful! We walked all the way around the park (back of the park) with staff pointing lights and everyone was pushing into each other and if your hand slips from ur child then they are lost! That   s how bad it   s was. Then when we got the end (everyone assumed the end) we were all just left with no explanation. So poorly organised. The rides were brilliant after you queues and although we were at Disney for 5 days you still don   t see everything you want to or go on everything you want to but that   s expected. You must stay for the illuminations at least once they were amazing and the so much more than we expected and the parades were really unreal. The park clean very clean and staff make sure it   s like that all day and night. The food and snack are expensive but it   s what we expected so no shock. I also like the fact all the gifts and toys were the same price on any shop throughout Disney. Be aware of the people outside the gates asking for your tickets as you leave! It   s a bit naff having to walk past them. Also little tip...the train station at the bus stop have 2 great little shops inside for snacks, sandwiches, wine a cigarettes.We did have a great little trip and we are glad we did it but I   m afraid we wouldn   t go back.","Neutral"
"I   ve been to both Disney parks in the US and expected the same in Paris. The rides are nowhere near the same. The details lack and most rides are very short. The fireworks were spectacular, but the rest was just ok.Still had a fun day, because it   s Disneyland and who can   t be happy there?","Neutral"
"overall Disneyland still maintains some of its magic with some good rides but the fastrack system is very poor. we managed to use it once in the morning returning at 1pm after booking our slot at about 10.30. that was ok but after 1pm we found all other fastrack options were only available after 7pm. rubbish. Disneyland needs to learn from universal   their front of the line system is much better. also why Disneyland think that selling greasy burgers and horrible fries constitutes a great meal and a sandwich is a turkey burger I don't know. again we visited universal last week and their eateries has much better selection of snack type food","Neutral"
"It is Disneyland... what is not to love??? I wouldn't trust ANYONE who doesn't love Disneyland!","Positive"
"A CHILD'S LAS VEGAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!clean park, cast members smiling. the characters, world renown!cost is expensive, and goes up every year. this year i decided not to renew my annual pass for the first time in about 5 years. my kids luv this place!i know this place very well. Disney has a stronghold here!","Positive"
"Having been to the two parks in America and the one in Paris, whilst in Hong Kong it was a must to come here. Obviously a much smaller scale to Anaheim and a few of the favourites are not here but it definately runs along the Disney theme. Nice touch is the Disney train you catch to reach the park, definately gets you in the mood for a Disney packed day. I just found it very expensive and ended up not buying anything in the park to take home with me which was disappointing. I would still recommend to go, especially if you haven't been to a Disney park before but perhaps pack your lunch and be prepared to fork out heaps for a momento. Word of warning, if there is a typhoon warning do not go to the park. They say many things are still open but most things are closed and they still charge you full price to get in. Many disappointed children walking around and some very disappointed Aussies!! We ended up going again and it was much more enjoyable.","Neutral"
"Hot, overcrowded with little chance of getting on rides .... I certainly wasn't feeling the Disney Magic! Disneyland could learn a lesson from Universal and provide better shaded facilities for queuing and use cooling fans.","Negative"
"Since I went to Disney World in Orlando, FL first before I ever went to Disneyland, it may have been unfair for me to rate Disneyland based on my experience at Disney World. It doesn't compare. I would not waste my time and money at Disneyland. But maybe if I never been to Disney World and went to Disneyland only, I may think differently. And if I lived closer to Disneyland, I may feel otherwise.","Neutral"
"We will surely come back to this magical and happiest place on earth! We spend 3 days in Hong Kong, Day 2 for Disneyland, it was February 14, 2016.The day before was their 10th anniversary so luckily the place not too crowded and no long ques for rides. But honestly we were not able to try all the rides since we arrived past 12 noon because we had a city tour before we proceed there. One of the best is Grizzly Gulch ride and 4D film show. My daughter was so amazed. We really enjoyed it. Thumbs up for Day & Night parade especially for the breathtaking fireworks. Souvenirs and foods are so pricey!","Positive"
"It is extremely expensive and not a viable option for middle income or lower.  Go with a full wallet, at least a week's wages for one day.","Neutral"
"For Disney fans this park is a must the original and even though it   s the smallest it feels special! Out of the Disney parks I   ve visited this park for me feels special. As with all the parks it   s spotless and while a little dated this adds to the charm, my only downside was no fireworks the park was full and I feel it   s what we all wanted.","Positive"
"Star Wars.  Pooh   s Corner.  That Castle.  Princesses and Stormtroopers and Mickey and friends all in the same place...Inner child   s Heaven!!!!  So much fun and the character movie based treats made it that much more fun!!!","Positive"
"We spent 2 days here with my immediate family and extended family. It was so unbelievably full of people. I knew it was going to be busy, but it was really difficult to enjoy the park with that many people. Line ups ran 100 mins or more. The first day we were able to get our fast passes in the morning and we got times for 9:30pm. Some of the staff at the restaurants were absolutely done and didn't provide good service. The second day we just gave up, most rides were out of passes. I'm happy to say we all came back measles free from the recent outbreak. Lesson learned, we will never come to the Magical Kingdom for Christmas. I think it'll be another 5 years before I can consider coming back after that experience.","Negative"
"Disneyland was fun but it is no Disneyworld. It shows its age and many rides and attractions feel like throwbacks to the old days of amusement parks. The staff in Orlando are friendlier and more in character. Anaheim staff just clocking the hours by comparison....More","Neutral"
"I will start by stating that I am not really Disney fan and this was my first visit at any of their theme parks in my life since my wife really wanted to take the kids. If going into it you know you will stand in line on average of 30 to 60 minutes that would be good to know   this also includes getting food or going to the washroom. The sheer volume of people they allow in the park is overwhelming and seems like nearly every experience you need to pay extra or wait in line for long periods of time. Some of the rides are fun   Star Wars and Space Mountain as an example   and getting in with fast pass helps but basically felt like a cattle being herded all day from one line to another and every where you turn someone is trying to up sale you on something. The amount of waste this park must produce to me is also appalling   only recycling stream is for coke product and everything else goes to landfills. It is very clear they are in the business of making money and are very good at it but personally. For a family of 4 with two kids ages 4 and 6 we spent over $1,000 which is more than any one day activity I have ever spent...first time at their theme park and hope to never have to go again.","Negative"
"we thought one day is not enough, but, surprisingly, it was! Disney Hongkong is apparently the smallest Disneyland in the world, so one day visit is just enough. the happiness from my 5 year old faces seeing buzz, woody, donald and the rest of the disney characters was truly priceless!!!we didnt have any problems going to the place due to a very accommodating tour guide!","Positive"
"My husband and I took our 10month old daughter here for the 1st time and throughly enjoyed it. It is cheaper to book tickets online and we would recommend this. We came by the RER and arrived just before 11am. The park was quite busy and the queues for most of the rides that we were looking to go on were between 20 and 30minutes. Some of the bigger rides (like buzz light year and space mountain) were 50minutes. With a young infant we were able to enjoy pirates of the Caribbean, Snow White, Pinocchio, the fairy tale boat ride and the mad hatter tea cups. It is worth saying that some rides are closed such as its a small world and the train which goes around the whole park is also closed. However we still really enjoyed it. In terms of value for money food and drink in the park is expensive so we would recommend taking a picnic. Lots of families are doing this so its no problem to bring in your own food and drink into the park.All in all it is an excellent, family day out. Undoubtedly the park is not as big as the Florida Disney or indeed the Anaheim Disney but it's probably better than Tokyo Disney and the one in Hong Kong. We will no doubt return again.","Positive"
"We visited the Disney California Adventure park and purchased a one day hopper ticket. This allows you access to both parks on the same day. We had a fabulous time at the Disney California park which we stayed at until we watched the 5.15pm parade. This then allowed us to move over to the Disneyland park for the later part of the day as it was open until midnight. This park has the main fireworks display taking place at 9pm which was fantastic but some of the rides were closed off before this which was disappointing as we were not made aware of this. The main access around the park was also restricted for the display which made it really difficult to move around (even although the fireworks were not til later the restrictions started about 8). The park is a great park but I wouldn't buy the one day hopper!","Neutral"
"Having never been to a proper theme park (only the crappy, unsafe Thai ones) I have to say this is well worth the money. The place is spotlessly clean, well organised, punctual and not too crowded.The better rides like Space Mountain were less popular (probably as there were very few teenagers) but the boring rides like Dumbo have a 1 hour queue??? Still can't figure that one out.Water is ridiculously overpriced so better to bring your own and the food is bland. Bring some chili sauce. The train goes straight to the park entrance and can be accessed from anywhere in HK.Crappy Disney souvenirs are littered all over the place, so if you are on a budget, cover your kid's eyes. On hot days the lining up can be a nightmare, so it would be nice to have a little more shade and some mist fans.","Positive"
"We enjoy going to Disneyland with the little one. Just go with an open mind, expecting the crowds and try to plan your day as best you can. Or don't plan at all and go with the flow. It's a fun place to spend a day or two.","Positive"
"The Disneyland was very crowded. However we still enjoyed the parade and rides. It was sad to hear Mickey only met people till 2pm as the park is open till late night. The firework was good.","Neutral"
"Too many people and long waiting lines, however you can book in advance by using Fast Pass.Food quality need to improve with more choices.Provide moe shaded area while waiting on lines. Direction signage is not clear.The train is not in service which was disappointed.Not enough shaded area for people to rest and sit, as a result, people are sitting on sidewalk.Cheers,Max","Neutral"
"Overall the place is ok. Yet, you need to plan well before going. I suggest you to go early in its opening hours as you will not have to queue up for long for the rides. Around 3pm, you need to wait for around one hour for a 5min ride.Also, if you are a Muslim, know that there is no good dining option and there is no prayer room. It will be difficult to have a place for prayer.","Neutral"
"My aunt and I met my sister at the grand hotel. We had 4 hours of free parking IF we ate at one of two restaurants. We went to the lounge were we drank and ate and visited for 6 hours. Our bill was $ 314.00. Our parking was $70. No free parking if you don't go where they want you to go or stay longer. Ridiculous.","Negative"
"For our family of 4 we chose 3 day Disney passes and accommodation via AirBnB   we found a bargain 7 night stay in an elegant family apartment in a close by village for   500. Wow! We took food, sweets and drinks into the park to cut costs and ate 1 meal at Disney each day. Good points:  fountains, flowerbeds, topiary, trees and natural wood and rocks made the park feel like a beautiful garden in places   well done for a top effort on the good maintenance and upkeep, including some immaculate toilets (mostly).OK (ish) points:  The parade was good; costumes, dancers and floats were impressive but we needed to sit on a kerbside about 40 mins before it started.   Princess show was good but why so many vocals on the backing track   more princesses should sing, only 2 performers actually sang!  Illuminations were impressive but no decent view points and it was very late at 11pm so we had to leave part way through and watch it on UTube the next day!   Marvel show had impressive projections and stage sets but the waiting time was so long and we should   ve been allowed inside the theatre earlier. Bad points:  Overpricing of everything! Immoral maybe even?!!!   Parking was expensive at 25    each day. Why?!  Some of the car park moving walkways weren   t working.   We felt unsafe walking past the train station.   No signage anywhere in the park!   Lengthy queues everywhere   the fast passes were only useful if you got to the park early.   Hardly any rides in Adventureland and not that many elsewhere for small children.  Some rides were based on dated themes.   Some rides started with lots of empty seats.   Old fashioned staff uniforms instead of something modern that the staff can be proud to wear.  The    app    didn   t work sometimes so it wasn   t that useful for us; the show times and queue waiting times were all incorrect and it wasn   t obvious how to book the meet    n    greet slots.   Lots of junk food.   Couldn   t book a table at Planet Hollywood so we had to wait over 30 mins. Cold pulled pork and chips was sent back then the waitress forgot that the order was with no pickles so the next one went back too. Tortillas were not served sizzling and the peppers and onions were actually still raw! All in all we have enjoyed the holiday but not sure if we will come again. the park needs more rides   and ones that can seat many people so the queues go down quicker.","Neutral"
"We have visited Disneyland Park in June 2017. I together with my 2 years old son wanted to try Disneyland Railroad attraction. After 1 hour of waiting attraction employee did not let us in the boarding room because there was only one place left. I told him that I can take my son on my knees, but he said no. On my question, how much time I have to wait  he answered approx. 1.5 hours. That is too much for 2 years old child! That was our first impression from Disneyland Park. And it was also the strongest one! We refused to wait, went down, sit in some sheriff car, which brought us to the castle. It was a great desicion because all attractions for very small children are located in the farrest from the entrance part of the park, behind the castle. Great business desicion from organizers of this park!!! :((((","Neutral"
"It probably the tiniest Disneyland in the world, right size with 2 young kids easily get tired. The park facilities were cute and clean. Staff members were polite and high respect to their guests. Just wish they had better foot traffic control though. Those groupies (I guess) were cutting in lines often, and it was frustrated for the rest who were follow the rules. 2 year old couldn't stop saying 'mommy, its not fair'!","Positive"
"We were here with our 11 year old son. It is a smaller park compared to the parks in the U.S. and definitely doable in about 7 8 hours. Our favorite rides were the Grizzly Gulch, Hyperspace Mountain, and Iron Man Experience. My number one tip is to get there right at 10:00. No lines to buy tickets to get into the park and super quick to walk over to the rides. We were there on a Thursday in January and we didn   t have any lines longer than 5 minutes until around noon. We also got a fast pass for Hyper Space Mountain in the morning to be sure we could come back again later without waiting. I would also recommend downloading the Hong Kong Disneyland app to see wait times and get a map of the park. We ate at the Main Street Corner cafe and the sweet and sour chicken and shrimp and the burgers were really good. It was easy to get here with the MTR and it took us about 35 minutes to arrive from Kowloon. I don   t think I would come here a second time, but definitely worth a visit at least one time.","Positive"
"So, getting right to the cons...too expensive for the quality of service and attractions. 400$ plus for one day. Lines, hoards of people everywhere, pushing, running into you, vying for the best spot to view the parade, fireworks, etc. Food and drink is beyond over priced and restaurants are difficult to get seating without reservations. Parking is more $$$ added to your day. It was just a let down. Disney should not allow so many people in the park per day and it could be the Happiest Place On Earth. But right now it's just a scam for Disney to make as much money as they can. My kids  6&8  preferred Knotts...and so did my husband and I!","Negative"
"To put this in context   we're older customers. Not kids. But love Disney and the parks. So we wanted to try this place as we were in HK and it's only 30mins from the city.Overall, not busy at all. Visited mid week and was amazed how few people there were. Zero lines for the rides and no general sense of excitement as per the other parks in the world. Very odd. The general scale of the whole park is low and compact. Main Street seemed like a scaled back version of the original. The Castle is tiny!The Chinese visitors don't seem to want to try the 'aggressive rides' (Space Mountain etc) and appeared to meander around the place in awe. The rides are just the old favourites, given a slight spin or name change; the exceptions being the ToyStory Land ones...but there are no 'grown up' rides at all. We managed to do most of the rides at least 2 times and were in the park a total of 4hrs. The staff generally were lacking any sparkle and most were yawning. Least enjoyable Disney experience.","Neutral"
"I came several times and used to enjoy it more, the rides and shows are still great but it's truly getting too over crowded and staff are less and less friendly in a supposed to be a happy place.","Negative"
"over priced, over hyped, far too many people in such a confined area (far to craven for a pound note euro) rude and surly staff . food and drinks ok, merchandise a complete rip off. unsafe levels of lighting after the fireworks show (pushed trampled over) 3 times on way out, on crutches. queues that tested the resolve of this stiff upper lipped brit. and the thing is my kids are now saying they wouldn't want to got to the real deal in florida based on this farce (even though me and the wife know it rocked and we loved it ). went to parc astrix a couple of days later and it was awesome, everything Disneyland should have been","Negative"
"The name disneyland just makes you want to think it will be a magical wonderland, although designed really well i prefer Universal studio in Singapore over this and regret not going Ocean park which looked like we would had more fun. Food and beverage was limited, long queues to take photos with the main characters, kept on changing them without any notice, limited rides, mainly for kids so Disney saying for all ages is just not correct. Hoping Paris and Florida experience will be better if i ever go. Only good thing was at the end Fireworks over sleeping beauty's castle.otherwise place is really overrated!!","Negative"
"Having never been to Disneyland before I think I just expected it to be bigger and grander. I think if I was 5 years old then I would have thought it was amazing. It looks a bit aged but they are obviously doing work on things as Sleeping beauty   s castle and a few other things were all closed for renovations. It   s not cheap but not overly expensive either. The rides we did go on were great and the street parade was fun. We got there at 10am opening and had walked the park and were done by 1:30 and had ridden a few rides, there really isn   t that many. We went on a Monday so didn   t have the massive queues either. I think if we had gone when our kids were young we probably would have enjoyed it more it certainly is a place for small children.","Neutral"
"I've most likely been to a Disney park for the last time. It was clean, attractions are attractions, waiting in 50 to 90 minute lines the normal. What I did notice was that the personnel, especially running the attractions were about 50% of them were not watching the patrons, were not assisting the patrons, just talking with co workers or daydreaming. It was disappointing from a safety perspective. I'm sure there are many first timers wondering if they are doing the right thing at the right time. Something has changed, and from my perspective not for the better.","Negative"
"Unfortunately the park was very crowded. The wait period to get on the rides was at least 90 minutes. Although Disneyland is a magical place the lines to buy food, get on rides and watch the parades is overwhelming. I loved the Christmas themes, but definitely you need alot of patience. I believe for the price it is very unfortunate you really don't get your monies worth. I saw alot of children crying because they were tired if awaiting in.lines definitely a challenge for parents. As a couple we did enjoy walking around and enjoying the atmosphere.","Neutral"
"We visited Disneyland on Christmas Day, and California Adventures the day after.Both parks are great, there is something for everyone. I'm afraid of heights, was thinking there will be nothing for me except the  baby rides . How wrong... I enjoyed so many attractions, and absolutely loved Soaring Over California (even if only by a second attempt, and holding tight to my husband). Our 12 year old who is becoming  too cool  for the characters and some of the rides loved EVERYTHING, and even asked to go to visit Mickey (at 10PM...turned out, we were the only ones there   no waiting, and Mickey all to ourselves).The fast passes system helped a lot!!However, both parks must know that for parades and for the water show, there will be extreme crowds to handle, especially at Christmas time. HIRE MORE PEOPLE!! TRAIN THEM!!Their system of controlling the crowd is awfull and absolutely not working. We were pushed away, yelled at, sent all over, squeezed in a little roped area with no respect or friendliness. Each staff member was saying exactly the opposite from what the previous would say. In Disneyland, there was an extremely rude and aggressive security guard with the nametag Rich who threatened us without even listening for a second. Our child got terrified, and the whole experience got an unnecessary scratch. In Aventures, they would not let us go anywhere for a while (all of us had those colored fast passes), giving some senseless explanations, and children were crying that they will miss the show.For the staff its just a working place, and visitors are best once their gone, we know that. But try to consider how many hundreds of dollars each family leaves there... Some people save for years to go there. And Disneyland should be able to cover the expense of some extra staff on those special, extremely popular dates. They earn enough...Very dissapointing.","Neutral"
"Steer clear of the new year time period as we had four days of not being able to access rides and fireworks cancelled with no notification. In queues many times for over an hour to have the ride break down and having to start again. Too many people with rides not always functioning. Was a major disappointment.","Negative"
"As part of our Silver Wedding celebrations in Paris my husband and I decided to visit Disneyland Paris where we had visited 25 years ago on our honeymoon, the Christmas they had first opened. What a huge disappointment! The park itself had lost some of its initial sparkle. Fast pass tickets only cut a short time off the long queues. Our favourite ride, Pirates of the Caribbean was closed. Apparently being mended but there were no signs visible when you paid full price for your park tickets to state that this ride or Hyperspace Mountain were both closed. Burgers for two came to over    30 for lunch and if you wanted to queue for 30 minutes to have a photo taken with Darth Vader it would cost nearly    40 for your 3 prints. After spending several hours in the park, we moved on to Disney Studios where there were much newer rides but the exact same studio tour we saw in 2006 with our son. Overall a huge disappointment!","Neutral"
"We spent 8 days in Coronado the last week of September. Friends from Michigan flew in on Tuesday and had planned a day trip for us to Catalina early Thursday morning. All 4 of us (my son & I and the couple from MI) got to Dana Point early only to find out that the ferry was sold out ... I guess that shows how far in advance they had  planned  this day ... . So rather than scrap the morning I suggested Disneyland. Mixed grumbling ensued but the decision was made to drive the extra 40 minutes for a fun filled day.MUCH had changed   parking, ADMISSION cost !!!!!","Positive"
"I m a big Disney fan so I am partial to this place. It's always amazing to me. Try and go during the school year if you can that way the waits aren't as long. The 60th year celebration is so amazing. I too turned 60 this year so I of course had to go and celebrate with Mickey! ","Positive"
"Make this quick. MaxPass it! Schedule the rides. Try to do the early in times as well. Prepare for rude people after 1pm, lots of stroller road rage, try to keep your family safe! next time we know but I think I will wait another year before returning. We will try California adventure this summer.","Negative"
"We spent 5 1 2 days at Disneyland and California Adventure in the first week of December. And thank goodness we had so long as the parks were VERY crowded. We tried to line up 30 minutes before the parade and we ended up somewhere we could only see the back of the floats :(The tickets were EXPENSIVE (A$1100 for 5 day park hoppers for our family of 2 adults and 2 children). If you want to wait less than an hour to see a character, you have to pay $100  for a character breakfast. If you want a seat for the Candlelighter's performance, that will be $50. I paid $6 for a hot dog that was a micro bun and a small sausage. I've had better food, and more reasonably priced, in airports :( If you want to actually see World of Color, buy a meal that includes a fast pass to a reserved area. It's add on, add on, add on. Which after shelling out $1100 to get in the gate, I thought was too much.The lines were horrendous. 45 minutes to get in the gate with our pre paid tickets on day 2 as they were checking photo ID of EVERYONE who had more than a one day ticket. So that was basically everyone. DREADFUL experience. Two hours   line up for the Radiator Springs racers. Over an hour for the Buzz Lightyear ride in California Adventure. And on and on and on and on the line list went. Not at all suited to small children who have zero waiting tolerance let alone when they are tired.Would I take our family back again? Afraid not. That was my fourth visit to Disneyland in California and I fear it will be my last. Which is a REAL shame.","Negative"
"I've been to Disney Parks on 3 continents and Disney Paris is great value! The park is small which make it very manageable, the ticket is the best value in the Disney family of Parks and the dinning was great. I really enjoyed the rides and the restaurants. I especially enjoyed their take on Space Mountain and the Blue Lagoon restaurant.The shopping was very hit or miss and the product quality needs to be inspected carefully. The  Downtown Disney  area is a fail and I would avoid (especially for food & drinks) except for World of Disney for last moment souvenir shopping. Would I return? Yes!!!","Positive"
"I love, love, love Disneyland. When we arrived it poured down with rain but it did not last long. We never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a ride so mid week in September is a good time to go. The highlight for me was the parade in the evening. I felt like a child again. Disneyland did not disappoint. We only had a day to spend at Disneyland and a day to spend at California Adventure Park. Due to the low crowds we were able to ride all the rides we wanted and even went back to the flume ride 3 times! It was our favourite.","Positive"
"I've always been more of a Six Flags Magic Mountain kind of guy. Any time I think about going back to Disneyland, the ticket prices always steer me in the direction of the mountain. Or the nearby farm. Well, I decided a few months ago that 15 years was long enough.While Disney won't break any height or speed records, what they excel at is completely immersing you in the ride experience. Once you're in the park, the outside world ceases to exist. It's easy to get caught up in the whole  Happiest Place on Earth  thing, despite the constant crowds.Of course, the best way to beat the crowds is to take advantage of FASTPASS. The best tip is to always get your next FP before you use your current one. (Make note of the time at the bottom where it says,  Another FASTPASS ticket will be available after... ). Other than that, the posted wait times at each ride are fairly accurate. You can also download an app like MouseWait (it even helps you find the nearest restroom).Disneyland is simultaneously a ton of fun and a ton of work. But with a little planning, you can quite easily make the most of your day.","Positive"

"Took my 2 children 4 and 8 for the bank holiday weekend. So having been before I know it's not Florida, expected it to be a busy weekend and I am a fan of Disney. What I didn't expect was to queue for hours on rides to get to the front and be told they have had to stop the ride die to technical problems. In 2 days this happened 3 times! Queued for 40 minutes for Pinocchio and just as we got to the front they had to stop the ride for 20 mins, then straight over to Peter Pan where we queued 50 mins and they stopped it due to technical problems then at Ratatouille the next day, queued and then this was closed again due to technical problems and for a good couple of hours, though when it finally reopened it was one of the best rides. Also disappointed with the food, unless you wanted a full on meal in a good restaurant (which we're generally fully booked) the only other options were an all you could eat buffet, a dodgy hot dog or a pastry on the go, not many options to grab a sandwich or even a burger on the go, came home feeling very unhealthy. Last gripe was not being able to get a good spot for the parades or fireworks but that's just because it was so busy you need to get a spot about 40 minutes before! Some great rides; thunder mountain, buzz light year, ratatouille, Florida next time!","Neutral"
"We got caught off guard how bureaucratic Disney can be!When we booked the tickets off the app, nothing was said explicitly about selfie stick not allowed into the park. We explained we did not deliberately bring the selfie stick but forgot to remove it from the bag since we came in a rush. We perfectly understood why selfie stick is not allowed in the park.Even better, there was not facility to store the selfie stick and the only options (which were not options to us) were to leave it in the car (which we took Lyft there) or throw it away (drastic!).Yes we so excited to see Mickey and we did not read carefully the 1000 lines of terms and conditions before heading to the park but why not spare some thought for customers to allocate lockers to store the long list of prohibit items, which could be accessed after exiting the park? Why no such option?We saw people smoking and puffing in the park too why they were allowed entry to the park with cigarettes and e cigarettes in their bag??This was a bad start of the day resulted from bad thought process of handling exceptions!We wanted a refund and got directed by security to the ticket booth, waited for 30 mins and the booth staff apologized they could not help since the ticket was booked from the app!","Negative"
"1st time visit to Disneyland and it was Magical. Although it rained all day and made things difficult to explore, it didn't dampen our mood. Staff were welcoming and there were so much to see and do. We will definitely come back again and I would advise that you'll probably need a 2 day ticket to fully enjoy everything that Disneyland has to offer.","Positive"
"We went to Paris Disney Land with family. (along with a 3 year old kid).We took a train from Paris (near Arc de triomphe). It nearly took an hour to reach Disney land.We reached there by almost 10am in the morning. We spend almost till 5pm in the evening in Disney land. There are two parks for you to see and therefore better off , if you take a ticket which enables you to visit both the parks.Its indeed a great experience if you have not gone to similar places earlier.the first park is called disney land park , where you coul see all the big small medium rides and the second park is Walt Disney Studios , where you could lot of actions from Hollywood movies and how its made...(both are extremely good).Is some rides , you would be able to obtain a FASTPASS (but this is not available outside for sale to my knowledge). The way it works is basically you get a fast pass from one of the rides which is busy..you would then get an allocated time and you have to be there at the exact specific time for the ride.When we went to Disney land , they were celebrating the 20th anniversery.Some restuarants are highly prices , however you would be able to see others as well.","Neutral"

"I've been to Disneyland Paris 3 times before and both California and Florida. Unfortunately Paris is now a very poor relation to the American Parks. The parks claim to be non smoking but people smoke everywhere and the staff just ignore them. We had to move twice while waiting for the parade because people started smoking next to our children. The customer service is mediocre at best. As an example of this my daughter had a birthday badge at California last year and all the staff said happy birthday and the entertainers sang to her (magical). This year we only got 2 happy birthdays all day and very few of the staff break into a smile for anything. There is a severe lack of characters. When I first went about 10 years ago there were Disney characters everywhere including the restaurants. I counted 3 in the whole of Hollywood studios, which doesn't even have a parade any more and the Frozen parade in the main park consisted of a single horse and carriage. The shows are nowhere near as good as the American counterparts. While the kids enjoyed the Frozen sing along the production values are basic (bring back Tarzan) and nothing like Aladdin (California) or Lion King or Belle (Florida). In short if you want a great Disney experience save the extra money and go to the USA. I can't say the kids didn't have fun it's just that it could be so much better with a little effort and the odd smile.","Negative"
"Well, Disney is Disney, but this park is so much smaller than I remembered it being. I don't really think it was worth the price of admission. So small compared to Disney World.","Positive"
"We had a lovely full day at Disneyland Hong Kong.We have been to Paris, California and Florida parks and Hong Kong is tiny in comparison but it is a still a fun day if you are in the area.The castle is still there but is partly obscured by construction walls and a crane   it will soon be demolished for a new super castle in 2019 which is really exciting.The park is mostly bilingual with English and Cantonese (and Mandarin on occasions)   we would it hilarious when Mickey and friends spoke in Cantonese.Tips:Highlights of the park that you have to go on   Mystic Manor (a unique experience amongst disney parks with a fusion of ratatouille and haunted mansion rides), Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Train (a fusion of Exhibition Everest and Big Thunder Mountain and a launch coaster), and Hyperspace Mountain (HKDL version of space mountain). We went on each of these twice and loved them. The rest of the park rides are the same similar as the rest of the parks around the world.Mickey and the Wondrous Book is a really special show and I highly recommend you see it. Each performance was full and it wasn't until our third attempt did we get a seat! It's a fusion of Florida's happily ever after night time show and Paris's Peter Pan night time show. The live singing and performers were all excellent.Both parades were excellent and are your opportunity to see lots of characters at once. Arrive 30 minutes before to get your spot.If you want to meet characters get to the park for 9.30am. Gates open at 10 and there are lots of characters to meet on main street USA before the main park opens at 10.30   Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald and Daisy, Chip and Dale were all out and about.Only negatives of our day were the weak side show performances e.g. Moana home coming and the Christmas stage show. I'd avoid these and use the time to go on rides. Also the shops were always rammed and overflowing with queues snaking around the shop so you couldn't find the end of the line. If you want to get gifts and don't want to queue there is a hong kong disney store at the airport with the same prices and a fair bit of stock.","Positive"
"Right where do you start? First of all my 5 year old loved it, she was in dreamland but it is very expensive, not exactly magical and needs a lot of fairydust in my opinion. First up the Princess Pavillion, you have to queue for over an hour just to get a reservation and they are gone by noon. We knew about it having done research but there was next to no signs explaining the process so had no idea what line to join, did we all need to join and that you needed all your entrance tickets to get in for a one on one with Cinderella and Co. Asked a castmember who was just grumpy and pointed at a long line of waiting Mums and Dads kicking off the day in one of many queues. I don't understand why the big rides for big people are all fast pass but Disney thinks it is OK for young kids to have to wait over an hour to go on rides. Surely it makes sense to fast pass these rides for families can plan their day. Food stands and there are not many were poor, off milk, grumpy staff and closing up by 6 even if the park is open till 10. Some of the most popular rides were closed for refurb but when the French refurb a ride they need 6 months to do it. Surely you work 24 7 to get it done when charging 80 euro a ticket and 20 euro to park. It's all being done for the 25th anniversary but to have so many things closed across bith parks is a bit much at busy times like Easter. I quite liked the Walt Disney Studio park next door which was less crowded and seemed to feel a bit more like the US parks. Toy Story land was rammed and calling out for fast pass whilst the big thrill rides only had 20 minutes waits. The Terror Tower was excellent and a must go on. The highlight was the parade, it was really good even if it was identical on both the days we were there. So in conclusion glad we did it for our little girl but I think we will take the US option if we did it again. This park is great to have in Europe but it certainly is missing something, not sure what but it feels lacking that sparkle you expect from Disney. I know we knock the Americans but maybe that over the top cheesy customer service and attention to detail maybe just doesn't translate in France.","Neutral"
"Disneyland Paris suffers from the same pitfalls as Disneyland California   small park, high demand. The crowds are awful and the lines for food bathrooms are a nightmare. But if you don   t eat and never need to use a bathroom during your entire visit it   s probably pretty great. The Ratatouille ride that everyone raves about in the Studios park I found underwhelming; I   m not a thrill rider, but I was told by my companion that Space Mountain and Big Thunder are particularly great attractions that have some unique draws among their Disney park brethren. Phantom Manor was closed during our visit, which was a major disappointment. I enjoyed the walk through attractions like the dragon under Sleeping Beauty   s castle. We stayed open to close, which was grueling, but nothing beats riding the Orbitron at the end of the night with the fireworks going off in the background. And the crowds don   t stop when you leave the park! If you stay until close, be prepared for a cozy standing room only train ride back to Paris with all your tired, hungry compatriots.","Neutral"
"After our arrival in Hong Kong, we went to Disneyland and it was a nice experience. We arrived there at 11am and did all attraction until 6pm. For groups it is perfect, even when the amount of thrilling attractions is not too huge, beside the 2 rollercoasters there are only a few other funny attractions. For kids it is perfect and they will really enjoy it. There are a lot of attractions for kids and it is totally worth it, to check out the promotions online, before you go there.","Neutral"
"It is what it is but I would never go again. There was a distinct lack of characters around this year. Very few staff around and queues like you would not believe. I fear it brings the worst out of everyone!","Neutral"
"Just went to Disneyland during the week and it was good weather but way to busy for during the week and we kept getting directed all over the place by staff due to construction or closing off parts for a parade in 30 minuets and making us walk all the way around with a 8 month old, 2 year old and 5 year old. Was not able to get on all the rides mainly due to walking around a lot extra.Besides that it's Disneyland, happiest place on earth!","Neutral"
"We brought my 73 year old mother to Disneyland for the very first time. She can walk very short distances so we brought her wheel chair. We did not find the staff very friendly or willing to assist a person in a wheel chair at all. Maybe one out of every dozen employees actually made effort to assist us and it was very dis heartening.","Neutral"
"great parades and squeals of delight when we saw any of the disney characters but wow what crowds, queues and poor food. Is there a limit to the amount of people allowed in on any one day? the wait for most rides was 60 minutes long between 11am and 4pm daily and the wait for the  fast Pass  was just as bad. I have never seen so many tired children, parents and waiters as I have just witnessed. Less people and more break out, chill places for the children to play and not queue would be a great improvement.","Neutral"
"Make sure you utilise the fast ticket system! Lovely place, I enjoyed the suitcase and a dream musical   i could have watched that over and over again.","Positive"
"Fun for the day, however, everything is expensive. We packed a cooler and had lunch in the parking lot because everything in the park was so costly and the lines to eat were 2  hour wait. The lines for the rides were long as well. However, the kids had a wonderful time and it was a once in a lifetime experience. Some of the rides need to be updated and parking is expensive, but isn't everything, so I am not really complaining. Be prepared to spend on this trip. If you do your planning you won't stress out. Enjoy yourself! We did..","Neutral"
"Disclosure. I hate theme parks. I'd rather sit in traffic on the Paris peripherique than stand in line for half an hour to shoot a laser at Buzz Lightyear. So perhaps I'll share some insights for all those parents who are going to Disneyland Paris, just once, because they had a moment of weakness.First, the money.I booked the cheapest ticket online two days in advance. I think     50 euro is actually fair value. If you drive there, you'll pay an extra 20 euro to park   flat fee. Once inside, there are at least double the number of shops as rides, and everything you want to eat or drink is very average and expensive. A soft drink is 3.90, a portion of frites is 3.50.If you're a family of four, you'll easily burn 100 euro in a day on a single meal and couple of drinks.TimingWe went midweek in May. Before lunch we waited 15 30 mins for each ride. After 2 the numbers seem to double and the queues too.We were in the park by 11, and left at 4. It was long enough to do everything we wanted to do ( was with three young teens).ExperienceIf you're 8 and love Disney, it's probably fabulous. I thought the rollercoasters were ok, but you'll find just as good in any other theme park. (Reliably informed by my kids). Apart from that I missed the creativity, the surprising ideas, the WOW! There are more ideas in a single Disney film that you'll find in the park. Good luck!","Neutral"
"Vacationed from Missouri to Southern CA, where I grew up. It was my kids' second visit to the park. SOOOOO disappointed!!! Even though we love Disneyland, almost every single ride that my kids were tall enough for, was CLOSED.....at the same time!!!!! So heartbreaking. I understand Disney needs to upgrade from time to time but, oh well. We did ride 3 rides, plus the monorail and train. The characters weren't out either. Last year's visit was awesome but this year's was a total miss. Guess we'll see how next visit plays out.","Neutral"
"I was really disappointed by how bad this park is compared to other Disney attractions. I knew that it was smaller before visiting, but even with that knowledge I thought it was worse than I imagined. The number of rides is awful. If you want to spend your time queuing to have your picture taken with characters then you're in luck. We had a two day ticket and regretted it at the end of the first day. I'm sure it will continue to attract the Asian market (until Shanghai opens) but it is rubbish.","Negative"
"First time that we had visited Disney Paris and I have to be honest, after only going to Florida I was nervous that this park would disappoint.I am happy to report that we all had a great time! The only things that we noticed is that there were no way as many characters spotted around the park. During our 4 night 5 day stay we literally didn't see one princess. We saw chip n dale, goofy n Pluto and Micky and that was it. However as we had gone for the rides and atmosphere rather than characters, it wasn't a problem, just an observation.Oh and can someone ban the guys trying to sell the    1 Eiffel Tower key rings etc please   you literally say no to one and the next one starts on you.","Positive"
"So what can I say about the magical place on earth....terrible,for the money spent on getting in you would think that things would of gone smoothly, when coming to the park it wasn't to bad, but finding half the rides being closed because they were having problems and the staff being rudeThe entire place is just a shopping area with hardly any rides and with the money you spend to come in I do think that it's a waste of money. When it came to the night parade the staff were very rude and would snap at you if you stood in the wrong step and would shout if you tried to stand anywhere, josh who was outside the penny arcade area really made my time at the park a bad one and i would return again, when trying to enter one of the shops a staff member shouted and said I couldn't enter. The fireworks display was cancelled and a poor light show was given that lasted 2 minutes.I've found that this is not the happiest place on earth more like the dullest and rudest place on earth that just wants your money","Negative"
"I totally agree with Charlie1uk. We know the value of the pound is bad at the moment, but I object to have to pay at least DOUBLE just to be in Disney. What a complete RIP OFF! They have you there and they know it!POSITIVES: The kids enjoyed it   they would would'nt they! The charachters on the whole were very good. The pre booked dinners with the Characters were good especially Cafe Mickey, and the Prince Princesses at lunchtime (both pre booked as a package). Hotel OK  The Sequoia  rooms OK fairly comfortable, descent beds. Warm and air con good!NEGATIVES: Disneyland is a Massive Rip off! Everything you buy is over double the cost of in England and I thought that was bad enough!   70 to park at Ashford for 4nights 5days! Train station at Disneyland freezing and some staff are ignorant! Don't go in March as its just an icy cold concrete metal jungle! Freezing freezing cold! Have to pay for some public toilets! Fast food which we had to wait for for ages was cold, basic crap and double or more the cost of back home! Rather starve during the day than eat some of the cold nasty stuff they serve you up at the fast food outlets! We were late checking in and some staff seemed please they could  tell us off for being late ! and when you look around smiling at each other looking totally smug! Ignorant some of them! especially when your rushing with 3 kids and suitcases!! Sequoia Pool is terrible, freezing (thats the indoor pool) dangerous steps, dirty Jacuzzi with too many people and kids in   one unhygienic mess! and the staff just ignore you in general. Safety aspect terrible! The changing rooms are very small compared to the size of the place   just terrible. Looks good in the brochure : dont be fooled! Probably more negative stuff if I had the time. Hopefully my kids and grand kids won't temp me into going again just to see their smily happy faces when they meet the Characters! Hopefully someone might read this who will look into the rip off side of most things!","Negative"
"Having never been to a Disneyland before we were excited to go and kept it as a surprise treat for our 8 year old son on our last day of a trip to Paris.The first thing that hits you is how tacky everything is and in such a bad state of repair. Customer service generally could best be described as glum. Despite it not being school holiday time in France the place was rammed. We queued first of all for an hour and while approaching the front were told that the ride had to close for safety reasons.We caught sight of Mickey on a walk about and made our way over to the large crowd hoping to meet him. He was cordoned off by minders who barked orders at young children and their parents. Horrible. Waited patiently for another 45 mins or so to try and meet him but time ran out and he was off. Managed to get a photo of Mickey's back and my son smiling gamely in the foreground.The queues were building towards lunchtime so we thought we'd better try and get a place. The food offerings generally tended towards poor quality junk food at highly inflated prices. We stood in line for a further hour to get into a self service buffet type place. You pay up front on entering and extra for drinks.  Do you want a drink?  the harassed person on the till demanded. There is no menu and basically you have a choice between  soda , wine or beer. She then waved a curley Mickey straw in front of my son ... which was another 10 euros or so on top of the extortionately priced food. No thanks. We had already forked out 30 euros to kit the 3 of us out in rain jackets since it was tipping down and extra to stow our luggage ... while we were  enjoying the magic . We looked around for a table ourselves but were instructed to move to a smaller table laid for two once seated. We ordered drinks but after 20 minutes or so they still hadn't arrived. We asked a waiter who presumed we hadn't paid and wanted to see our receipt to prove it. Another queue for the ladies toilets (laughably inadequate for the size of restaurant) and we were out again for more  fun .Just under an hour to queue for the Buzz Lightyear ride which flashed by in a couple of minutes and it was time to head home.What a disappointment, it felt like the whole thing was an exercise in trying to extract the most amount of money for the least return. I am baffled by the good reviews ... you couldn't pay me to return. Save your money and go to Chessington on an inset day   it knocks spots off Disneyland Paris.","Negative"
"Heaven: The original Disney rides like Teacups and Small World: whimsical and sweet imagination; true artistry from the mind of Walt Disney. Hokey to some people but enchanting for younger children and adults too. So neat to see kids' eyes light up with the sheer silliness of it all. The character actors, princesses and heroes: These Disney employees really play the part and take pics with lines of children and still manage to make happy experiences for kids and families. Prepare your child to wait patiently. Bring an autograph book and pen. You don't have to buy there; bring from home. The night parade: Big floats with thousands of lights, music and characters. Disney takes the basic parade idea and multiplies it by a hundred. However, this is the most uncomfortably crowded time that we experienced there. Fireworks every night around 9:30. Tip: the fireworks are pretty substantial; you can see them from blocks away. If you don't want to be packed like sardines, you can stand or sit outside the park in the big plaza just outside the admission gates near downtown Disney and see them perfectly fine.  The greenery and landscaping: Yes, a detail but lovely nonetheless. The topiaries in fantasyland; trees shaped like an elephant, a horse, elephant. So charming. The greenery in Bugs World. Long lush greenery representing the point of view of a bug. The jungle greenery along the jungle cruise. A lot of areas in Disneyland are very open and sun baked, but there are a few green, lush, beautifully maintained greenscapes that are pretty. California Adventure Park: the partner park to Disneyland. Loved the art deco theme on the main street. The Frozen show at the theatre was great and air conditioned. This park was about 30% less crowded than Disneyland and had tons of great rides plus all the Disney characters make appearances there as well.Hell: A lot of walking, plus more walking. The July mid day heat is not the best time for families with children to walk for hours. Plan your excursion. Duck into the little movie theatres, restaurants and shops for regular doses of air conditioning. Also, plan rest breaks in shady areas. With kids, take a 5 minute break every 45 minutes or so. Sit, drink some water and re charge. Crowds, sometimes dangerous levels: Evening around 9pm was intensely crowded. They dim the lights in the park to prepare for the parade. Not a safe feeling moving through a crowd with a stroller, in the dark. Staff help direct with lighted batons, but still an uncomfortable experience. Ride Line Ups  What to add on this topic? They're a drag. Fastpasses are good and bad. You have to come back at a designated time  often hours later. You then have to plan your schedule around this one ride. You cannot get fast passes for multiple rides just one ride at a time. We found that for some rides it was easier to not bother with the fastpass at all. Sometimes just walking back to a ride area 10 minutes later will surprise you with a shorter line. Ear piercing noise on some rides: Shattering people's eardrums does not add to the thrill of the experience. This is not really an issue with the little kids rides but some of the older kids rides have noise levels that are ridiculously high.","Neutral"
"Good for day trip. But cant be compared with santosa island amusement options at Singapore . The best part was samba show and evening prade. Overall expensive and worth not visiting again.","Neutral"
"You can do as much research as you like, but Disneyland is crowded no matter the day now that Cars Land is open. I took the kids (12 and 8) out of school for two days and headed to Anaheim for a long weekend. We had a great time, but the crowds at DCA for Cars Land were unbelievable. If you're going, and want to do Cars Land rides, you really need to stay in a Disney hotel to get early admission...even though we did, it was still a long wait at Radiator Springs (great ride). This trip, we spent some time seeing the fireworks (great) and wandering Downtown Disney a bit (decent food). It was unseasonably warm (102   aack!) so we left the parks to swim most afternoons.It's been said time and time again, but it bears repeating...get to the park as early as you can possibly get in! You can visit more rides attractions in the hours before 11:00am than a whole day if you arrive late morning. Use Fastpass. Stay at a Disney hotel if you can swing it to get the early entry. When the parks start getting super crowded (noon ish), bail for a few hours. Go back in the evening when everyone starts leaving around dinnertime.We had a great time. Go with the flow   appreciate the architecture   let your kids explore the attractions that aren't  E ticket  rides (mine loved the Tiki Room, Tarzan's Treehouse, and even exloring Toon Town) when the park is crowded. Take the Riverboat and pet the animals at Thunder Mountain Ranch. Sometimes, Space Mountain can wait for another day...","Positive"

"I visited for a much needed break with my 8 and 7 year old in January for a weekend. We came from uk and stayed at the New York so my comments are based on just this   a Disneyland park package holiday. This included tickets, early entry, full board and hotel. It is also worth noting we have visited WDW before. I was extremely disappointed in every area. Firstly, pervasive were staff   they tried, but this left them acceptable   not the Disney difference and when things were not right, that customer service element was absent. That is so key to Disney, that attitude that you are here for something magic and we try to achieve that. The worst bit is they don   t even recognise it as a problem because it isn   t even part of the culture.The rides are mostly just that   there is nothing really unique here and what there is seems to have been pulled away   autopia not running, 3D show where captain eo was has gone, the fantastic pirate ship not open to public, playground closed. There is just no sparkle   lol those street performers, all the waving cast members on Main Street, all those ad hoc shows   none of that. It is just like another theme park. And seeing characters walking around clocked like some sort of creature rather than through hidden cast member access simply freaked my kids out. Poor show   Walt would not approve.The food is appalling   I made this comment 10 years ago on this site and prices have gone up and quality down. We ate two dinners and both cost over 100 euros and was inedible.The PhotoPass is beyond a rip off 60 euros for ride photos of low quality you don   t even want. As with many things you may judge this against the photopass you get in America were you will get dozens of photos taken per day   we didn   t get a single one outside a ride photo Conclusions   we enjoyed some rides. This was not worth the money, not special and destroyed buildings, characters and attractions that in America through these subtle staff and strategic elements become special. I would strongly recommend you don   t visit or if you do, go for one day, do not purchase food and stay off site","Negative"
"We booked our Disneyland Paris break last June 2015.When we arrived for our spring break holiday we were very disappointed, along with our three daughters to discover that the majority of the 'big' rides you associate with Disney were closed for maintenance.Whilst I appreciate maintenance is crucial, it seems greedy and very off that they allow the same amount of visitors into the park when basically there isn't enough rides to go around. The queues for the rides that were operating were awful. Queuing for over 1.5 hours to go on a ride that we could have gone on on a pier in Britain just isn't on. That is not what you go to Disney for.No compensation is offered, you just have to get on with it. We had saved for months for this and were bitterly disappointed.Check carefully before you book for closures.I have put a complaint through to Disney but doubt I will get any response.","Negative"
"Wife and I visited HK Disneyland on Boxing Day. The place was extremely crowded and the ques for the rides were very long and the RC Racer ride in Toyland took 1 hour !I hv previously visited Disneyland Anaheim and in Tokyo, but HK Disneyland by far is the smallest. Missed the haunted house there.","Negative"
"I usually love this park but there was a lot of rides closed down , the one I like the best Big Thunder Mountain Was closed and the only other ride open as I could see in frontier land was the haunted mansion. Also the good the the stores way too over priced. Disney need to look at this as I bought five pencils for a child at 9 Euro. I looked at a hand bag 300 euro and even the cheapest sweat shirt was 40 Euro.","Neutral"
"I'm not going to go into details about the park, what's left to say. Here's a couple of tips instead. When it comes to food, it's best to leave the park. If you don't want to go too far I highly recommend the Earl Of Sandwich in Downtown Disney. It's at the very end next to the AMC Theater. Two can eat like kings for about $20. If you don't want to leave the park but want to eat ghetto cheap, bring cup of noodles and hot chocolate packets and your own cup. Any vendor that sells coffee will give you a free cup of hot water. Instant hot meal!!!","Positive"
"the ticket price for Disney is so expensive i researched that the tickets in Hong Kong are more expensive than Paris Disneyland which is ridiculous as in Paris there are more attraction and more rides compared to Hong Kong Disney. however overall a good place to visit with the kids.","Neutral"
"Despite it raining every day we were there, we did the typical British thing and made the most of it (and lets be honest, the kids won't remember being wet and a little cold ... they'll just remember all the great experiences). My only issue was just how many attractions were closed this year ... the list is:Big Thunder MountainStar ToursPeter Pan's FlightPirate ShipFamily Robinson Tree HousePaddle SteamerRock and Roller CoasterAnimagicIt was a pity that my children didn't get to enjoy Star Tours and Thunder Mountain, which were two of the highlights to my visit when I was younger. I realise rides have to be closed for maintenance and refurbishment, but they could have staggered it far better, perhaps closing half of the simulators in star tours, or doing just a couple of rides a year instead of all at once.The silver lining to it being so wet was that a lot of people who are in driving distance of the park stayed away, and so the queues weren't too long (except for Ratatoullie and Crush's Coaster) ... my son managed 15 times on Space Mountain, which was about 13 more than I did last time due to the queues!","Neutral"
"I grew up going to Disneyland for summer vacations. Things have certaintly changed since then. But taking my grandkids kids for a family type reunion vacation was such fun. Only thing I would suggest, is if you have people in your party that want to meet the characters, plan on spending an entire day doing so. Unless of course, you are headed to Disneyland in the Fall or early Spring. The little ones loved the train and meeting the characters. My oldest granddaugther, 7, rode Star Tours and Indiana Jones for the first time. Star Tours is now her favorite, but Indiana Jones was too scary for her, even though she met the height requirements, the theme was too frightening. Be careful and considerate of the ages in your group. We did separate so the adult males could go ride some rides, while the women and children waited in line to meet the characters. We also wore matching shirts that my daughter made so that we could easily spot each other in the crowds. I'm feeling my age, so next time, it will be 3 days at Disneyland, with a day in between for more restful activities.","Positive"

"I had waited years to go, however, I was disappointed with the need for updates. Toon Town had faded out colors, paint chipped and felt that Disney is allowing the properties to decline.

"Have visited Disney parks in California and Florida, and recently had the opportunity to visit their park in Hong Kong. Getting here was very easy. The MTR provides Disney park with its own line. You can get to the park from pretty much anywhere the MTR services Hong Kong. We made our visit on a Tuesday ( May 2nd). Arrived there just minutes before the park opened (10:30am). Pleasantly surprised with the small crowd. The park entrance is very wide and clean. Landscaping is traditional Disney. As you pass the entrance (the main train station ) and walk into  Main Street, USA  you will understand why I chose the title   it's a small world after all . Had I done some research prior to coming I would have not been surprised by how small this park really is. It's nearly one fifth the size of Magic Kingdom in Florida. Aside from the small scale , the park is very much  Disney . Tarzan's tree house was closed for maintenance. This has a big impact considering the few attractions in the park. For the roller coaster enthusiasts , I recommend the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. I won't give it away just suffice it to say there are surprising maneuvers. Over all a fun park despite its small size ( you can easily cover the entire park at a leisurely walk in less than 5 hrs, just my opinion). Expect hefty prices for any and all goods you purchase in the park. Most park employees speak English enough to communicate with you. We were pleased to find most employees had left the Honk Kong attitude at the gate. Get a bench early (6 6:30pm) in front of the castle for a good view of the fireworks. Park closes promptly after the pyrotechnics (8:00pm). There are plenty of trains to take you back to your destination so no need to worry. Overall a pleasant experience , but the size of the park was disappointing.","Positive"
"When this park was first built, it was famous for being much smaller than any other Disneylands. I visited it before and again this trip. They have added many more attractions and it is now comparable to the other Disney Parks. Avoid weekends and Chinese holidays as it is terribly crowded with Mainland Chinese visitors.","Positive"

"My husband is a Disney phile. So we excitedly rode the RER out here. It was small, but we expected that. What we did not expect was how run down it was   how many rides kept breaking down over and over and over (took 3 tries to get onto Ratatouille   our main reason for going there!). The stores are WAY OVERPRICED and very small   could not believe how tiny the World of Disney was! Very limited sizes in merchandise. And they were out of buttons! You know, the buttons you get to celebrate a birthday, or first visit, etc. That was one of the 2 main souveneirs I wanted from France   that and a Disneyland Paris sweatshirt. I came home with neither. Surprisingly how few employees speak reasonable English compared to the rest of the country.","Negative"
"After having a wonderful time 20 years ago in Disney Anaheim, our expectations were admittedly high. I am bitterly disappointed with Disneyland Paris. It is overpriced, overcrowded (do they even think about limiting numbers in busy periods? After spending over $1500 for tickets for the 5 of us, I had to spend an additional $1500 for one day of fastpass just to ensure we got ANY value from the parks. The food is overpriced rubbish, and (here I go again as an Aussie coffee snob) the coffee was atrocious. The limitations they place on the tickets and the outrageous queues (120 minutes was the max we saw on our days there in early Jan) mean it is almost impossible to get the full value from your ticket. There are so many other great options for things to do in Paris please don't waste your money like we did. Additionally, because of the additional expense of the food and fastpass we felt compelled to buy, our kids left with no Disney merchandise (partly due to the price and partly on principle). All I can conclude is that it has all been downhill for Disney in the past 20 years, or that Paris is a shadow of the Anaheim version. Finally, the park has a no smoking policy which is absolutely ignored by many of the visitors and is not enforced by the staff. This is supposed to be the  happiest place on earth , not a vector for lung cancer in children.My advice, if you MUST go:1. Take your own food and drink2. Buy a fastpass. Total rip off but your tickets are worthless otherwise You are paying to queue.3. Get there early   it almost always opens earlier than the posted time, in our experience.4. Carefully examine the Ts and Cs on your tickets   multi day tickets in our case had to be used with a defined week period, which restricted our flexibility enormously.","Negative"
"We visited here 4 years ago in October and had a great time. However, in mid  August the magic has largely gone. Whilst the rides are good, the queues are so long that you can only manage 4 or 5 in a day. Also   200 for the day for a family of 4 is really steep.","Neutral"

"We made the mistake of going during our children's spring break, and the place was well over crowded and the lines were horribly long.

"Hong Kong Disneyland is clean, well organized, has good rides, and great shows.The Lion King Show is a wonderful extravaganza of dance and song. Tarzan's Tree House includes a raft ride and moving animals. I would not return because of the constant physical pushing, shoving, and cutting in line by adults. I have been to Ocean Park in Hong Kong and this did not happen there. I have been to the Florida Disney World and there was no physical pushing or shoving; and cutting in line may have been there somewhere, but it was by children. I asked one lady about this, and she said that the people doing it were mainlanders, but I saw others doing it too. There were no uniformed security people to stop it. I overheard one man with a heavy British accent turn to the woman with him and say  that man just shoved me and I shoved him back,  to which the woman answered  No, you can't do that.  This is an unusual situation that I have not yet found anywhere else in Hong Kong. For the most part Hong Kong citizens are very pleasant and helpful, so this was very surprising, especially since it was adults doing it. At one boat ride, there was four inches between me and the person in front of me when a Pakistani man pushed in front of me and all the people behind me then let two men and three women in front of him. The  FastPass Line  was an entirely separate area. If the security improves this would be a wonderful place to go.","Neutral"

"Went for a weekend with my 13 year old daughter.Stayed at one of the on site hotels which entitled us to early entry between 8 10am.Arrived at gates at 8.15, which were closed and not open until 9am. By this time hundreds of people from the various hotels were all queuing. No updates or info given as to what was happening.Got to ticket office with my mobile voucher, then directed to customer services. Queued at customer services to be told I had to email then the voucher, even though they could see it on my phone. They did not have the facilities to scan it. This is one of the largest company's on the planet, but they don't have the facilities to scan mobile vouchers??!!My email was unable to sent it to them, I was told at this stage that it was my fault for not printing it out   great customer service!! The que was full of families in the same predicament. I had a 13 year old who although fed up tried to find a solution by sending it from her email. Other families were not so fortunate, toddlers were crying, parents were stressed and it was certainly not the happiest place on earth.When we finally got into the park, we had arranged to have breakfast there, there was no one the to ask directions. Many of the large rides were closed. Frontier land is basically a waste of time.I have been to the Florida Disney which is far superior to this. I would recommend you save your money and go to Florida. Give this pour imitation a miss.","Negative"
"The place is nice, but, after i have visit in Paris and USA, this one its not that great.  it's feet more to little children.  The show at the evening was great.  I really waited to the  space mountain  but it was nice only.","Neutral"
"Having been to a few disneys, the highlight for this one are the shows. The Lion King is excellent almost as good as the real show. It is not a big disney, but has many of the usual rides. The food though is extremely expensive and of poor quality. I would get into one early though as queues form early. We went early and had the place virtually to ourselves but it filled up later with queues everywhere. Worth a visit if you have not been to a disney.","Neutral"
"After an easy but very busy train ride, you will be greeted with a very long walk to the entrance, we took the train around the park first to get a look at where to explore, all you see is trees, the main ride was down for maintenance, mystic manor is fantastic ride, the rest are boring, it's all but impossible to get a photo with a character, food and souvenirs are very expensive, movie world in Brisbane Australia is so much better.","Neutral"
"This was our first time visiting Disneyland, we usually go to Disney World. It was awesome! Smaller than DW, DL was more doable with just a few days to visit. They have many of the same attractions as DW, and some have a different twist....More","Positive"
"Weather was a little too warm for an October day so be sure to always check weather report especially for Southern California. The Halloween decorations were great! Park closed early due to special Halloween event that you had to pay for separately so got a little upset with that. Be sure to check park hours and scheduled ride closures. All the employees were friendly and made our experience very enjoyable.","Positive"
"The park itself is not massive like Disney in Orlando. It more resembles the Disneyland in California. A lot of the rides were closed for renovations (which they fully disclosed on their website), but it made us wonder why Disney would choose to renovate in the peak summer months and not in the winter? So the lines were longer than usual for the rides that were open. But otherwise it was a good experience.","Neutral"
"My daughter and I went to Disneyland Paris with our kids. We booked the Newport Bay . The first surprise was that breakfast was a 15 min. walk away.The hotel was halfboard and we had expected to eat in the hotel. We were wrong .When we finaly found where to eat, we had to wait in line for 30 min. to get an unhealthy    poorly    prepared a hospital food in a paper box. The staff everywhere in a park was incredibly slow. If you want to buy drink, eis cream, souvenir  line,line,lineFor every attraction you have to wait 40 75 min. for 5 10 of fun. The so called    fast pass    was not fast at all.To get lunch was another nightmare. When we finaly run into a restaurant that wasn   t packed, it cost 150,  Euros for 2 gnocchi portion and 2 kids hamburgers, 2 coffes and a bottle of water. It was robbery. When we ask to consierge to make reservation for next day, they said that it wasn   t possible, everything was full.The kids were dreaming about meeting all the Disney characters in the park. Only way to meet one was to wait in line more then one hour in the hotel.Only thing we took from this experience was have to wait in lines.We paid 2000,  Euros for 4 nights with half board and park admission for 2 adults and 2 children. I really regret wasting the money on a such nightmare.After 3 days of diasappoitment I was completly deflated and exhausted.If you do not have the money to waste, don   t!!!!!!! go to Disneyland Paris.","Negative"
"Kids had a good time, but it was below expectations. Meeting the characters is way too challenging, they shouldn't issue those autograph books if you need to queue 35 minutes to get a single autograph. The light   firework show is cool if you can stay that late. The parade is OK. It just felt really dated, the star wars ride is really old technology I thought with all the start wars mania they would have something cutting edge. Have never been to Florida but everyone we met said there is no comparison.","Negative"
"I love the recent improvements on some of the rides  especially Thunder Mountain RailroadUsual Disney, hot, busy, long queues, crying kids   but it's still a little piece of magicCalifornia screaming is simply the best rideYet to see the new soaringDisney  how about one day a week for over 21 year olds only   I'm convinced the adults enjoy it more than the kids","Positive"
"What happened to the requirement for Disney employees that they smile and are helpful? Things have changed! Three rides  went down  while waiting. $100 a day for tickets and only get to ride 4 things. Prices make it far from the happiest place on earth. Walt would be sad. ","Neutral"
"I'd been to DLP before without kids and it was wonderful. It really became magical with small kids. It's beautifully sculpted and full of fun and interesting things to do. There is quality and attention to detail in everything. The staff were consistently freindly and helpful.We arranged our travel separately and planned to take the TGV from CDG airport but, not having booked in advance, we couldn't get tickets and had to take the bus. Having successfully taken the train back I wouldn't bother next time. The Disney shuttle was an excellent service, at least as easy to use and not really any more time consuming. If you make the most of the Extra Magic Hours (if staying in a Disney hotel) to get a lot of quieter time in the park it can be a long day. Don't be tempted to miss the closing fireworks and lights show: Disney Dreams. It is truly spectacular. The lights, the fountains, the music, the fireworks... just amazing. It's definitely worth an afternoon siesta (avoiding some of the busiest times anyway) to let little ones get back to see it. The evening is much quieter in the park as well.The parades were also well worth seeing and again, the music adds to the atmosphere to make it really fun. My 3 year old happily danced away the time until the cars were close enough to see properly and then waved manically at every character who passed us. Both were captured with jaws dropped at the sights.Meeting the characters was wonderful though you do sometimes have to be careful of pushy parents trying to get their kids in first. The 'minders' are good at keeping order though. We did queue to see Micky and visit the Princess Pavilion (go early or WAIT) but the others we just came across, which is great. I wish we had found more. It was hard to get smiles for the camera for the first few but after that the awe passed a little quicker.We stayed at Santa Fe Hotel, definitely the poor cousin of the pack but I couldn't fault the room, food or service in any way. We could book our meals or shows from the information desk in the hotel and the shuttle was very efficient.here is loads more I could say but I'll end with this: Plan in advance. Take lots of money and be ready to let go!","Positive"
"Perfect for us, two night stay. No shuttle needed, but still a 10 min walk. Nice breakfast.  Parking was convenient. Would definitely go back.","Positive"
"I expected the high pricing on food and drinks so we planned ahead and had snacks before we went in and dinner off site.  The rides are great the park and restrooms are clean great 2 day trip","Positive"
"We visited Disneyland Paris with our kids in October 2001, and more recently in August 2004. The first time we went (in 2001), we stayed at the Hotel Cheyenne which was nice due to its location and fun wild west theme. However, it was a VERY pricey trip in all considering it was supposedly the low season (kids were NOT free) and many of the main attraction were closed for repairs (Pirates, It's a Small World, Carrosel, etc). Our family has grown since then (we have 4 children now under the age of 10) and this time there were no Disney hotels that could accomodate a family of 6 except for Davy Crockett's Ranch. This didn't work for us, 'cause you need to have your own transportation to and from the park; we flew into Paris from Amsterdam so we obviously didn't have a car. (How stupid is that, by the way   no shuttle service to DLP from one of the official DLP hotels!! That is something that maybe Europeans tolerate, but Americans never would!)So this time anyhow, we were able to get an awesome deal at the Holiday Inn at Disneyland Paris for two adjoining rooms (a great hotel, by the way  I would highly recommend it!) with a regular shuttle service. BUT   once you get INTO the park and surroundings, you quickly realize that this is anything but a charity ward. Having grown up on the West Coast of the US with regular vacations to The Magic Kingdom of Disneyland, I wasn't prepared for the highway robbery prices on everything at DLP! We just about went broke on meals in the three short days we were there   there was absolutely nothing there for families on a budget. On the last day we went to Mc Donalds in Disney Village to try to save a few bucks, but they were so crowded and expensive as well.The park was beautiful, but as a reviewer noted earlier, it just doesn't have the  heart  of the American parks (I noticed this also years ago when we were in Disneyland Tokyo) and somehow it lacks the  Disney Magic . The DLP park is definitely smaller than its American counterparts, and missing some important elements with regards to attractions. The fact that you are always reaching for your wallet (you are really at their mercy when it comes to food and drink there) really puts a damper on the happy, vacation feeling!A WORD OF WARNING: Do not go on Indiana Jones   Backwards!! unless you are suicidal!! In 2001, I went on the ride, and halfway through the trip when you go upside down backwards, I felt and heard an enormous C R A A A C K in my back! I got off the ride and could not even walk! I developed a hernia then and there from going on that ride, and have had problems with my back ever since!! And I am an avid roller coaster fan!!Another tip: Do not go to DLP during the peak summer months   you will be sorry! It was even more  crowded than Disneyland  (as we say in the States) and on the last day in the park, it took us 5 hours to go on just 3 rides (and we even had FASTPASSes!!)All in all, it was just a  nice  vacation, but not fantastic. This summer (2005) we are traveling to the US to be a part of the 50th Birthday Celebration at Disneyland, California with a commemorative special cruise on the Disney Magic, so I'll let you know how that is! Let's put it this way, it can't be worse than our experiences at DLP!!","Negative"
"I paid over $400 to take my 2 daughters to Disneyland and California Adventure. I think Walt Disney would be rolling over in his grave if he saw how overpriced his park has become. What made it even worse is that we wasted 4 hours in the evening waiting for rides that eventually broke down just before we made it to the front of the line.","Negative"
"Go early! Only way to beat the crowds and endless queuing. Get a map before you go, work out what rides you really want to go on. With your plan of attack ready. Line up before the park opens, go through security, when the park opens and run to your ride. I happened to be there on my birthday. Received a first visit and Happy Birthday badge. My Happy Birthday badge made me feel pretty special as staff throughout the park wished me happy birthday, even in downtown on entering shops. Food was pretty expensive.Biggest tip was that i hired an electric scooter from our hotel, within walking distance from the Park. Best money I spent! The Park is over a large area. I could carry all the kids bags and they had scooter wheelchair specific lines, where i could take an extra five people. We were part of a sporting group, so this was great. Cut down our queuing dramatically! Sunscreen, hat and water.Was a bit boring for older teens who preferred California Adventure Park, which was in same area and we could go between. Worth going back at night to see the street parade, brings out the child within.","Positive"
"Lovely park but people who smoke are smoking freely throughout the resort instead of using the designated areas. Cigarette butts are all over the park floors!! Disgusting. Disney is supposed to be smoke free isn't it ??????? When we questioned a member of staff about this he had a bad couldn't care less attitude. When we visited in June 2015, there were quite a few rides closed for maintenance or broken and what baffled us was why were cafes, drinks trailers, ice cream carts closed throughout the park and why were shows closed Monday to Friday ??","Neutral"
"If you hate crowds, crying children and long lines, then run (don't walk) far, far away. Disney World in Florida is significantly better managed. Guests in wheelchairs waited longer than guests standing in long, long lines! The weather was pleasant, but the staff was not. Our first mistake was to Fast Pass a ride in Tomorrowland. Although it was 9:15, the Fast Pass was for 3:30 and that eliminated using Fast Pass for the rest of the day (the return sign was wrong when it said 10:30). There are so many other great parks in southern California, do yourself a favor and skip Disneyland. Your children and spouse will thank you in the end!","Negative"
"Very disappointed at the amount of  Technical Difficulties  on various rides eg. Pirates of Caribbean, Peter Pan, Backlot Tour, they let us queue up for over half an hour without telling us these attractions were out of order, someone could have come out and told us, we returned the following day and pirates was still out of order, we asked why it was not fixed after the park was closed, they replied with a shrugging of their arms, not very satisfactory considering we were only there 3 days and we specifically targeted that ride with out grandchildren. We were not even offered a gesture of straight to the front when it was fixed, very very disappointed, it would never have happened in Florida. Also the cinematique theatre, be very aware do not take anyone in under the age of 18years, as there is a scene from the Exorcist on large screen of the BED... We had no warning at all of what was to be viewed, and my 5year old grandchild was traumatised, we complained but no one said anything, (we shall be writing separately to the company) it was appalling to say the least that Disney should have allowed this to be shown.","Neutral"
"Went there with my 7 and 3 yo; played most all attraction for kids; recommended is Winnie Storybook Adventure, Golden Mickey, 3D Philhar Magic, Mickey Wet Parade and the fireworks. The disappointment is Utopia, not the same as describe in the brochure. Prepare umbrella hat cause it's very hot at this moment and also be patience to queue especially for the above attractions.","Positive"
"We had so much fun at Disney for my Grandson's birthday!!  Even though it was raining, Disney still made it a special place to be!  The crowds were smaller and the lines were shorter, which made it a great day!","Positive"
"No magic, no atmosphere, no characters, so many rides shut for renovation, no happiness or cheer, complete waste of money....only good thing to say is that we were lucky with the weather!","Negative"
"I can't believe I am about to write this but... I was SO disappointed!! As a family we are huge Disney fans so that doesn't rest easy for me to say that. Having visited the Florida parks I knew there was a risk of the Paris version not living up to expectations but not to this extent. The park was average at best...there were NO characters walking around greeting children and creating atmosphere... which was lacking to say the least and the only characters we saw were Captain Hook and Smee but when we approached, a very cold, uncaring female stopped us in our tracks saying: 'We are finishing now are you here tomorrow?'. When I said 'no' she just shrugged her shoulders...she didn't make any attempt to appease our 4 yeqr old grandaughter who was absolutely devastated. I was deflated and could not understand why we couldn't have just joined the very short queue. Also three rides we approached were closed, all with 'technical problems'. Many of the mobile eateries were closed and the restaurants are so expensive. We were also told that our own food wasn't allowed to be brought in but we saw many people clearly enjoying their own pack ups throughout the day in the restaurant areas. Maybe for people who are experiencing Disney for the first time, Paris Disneyland Park might have some magic but I feel it is a very poor show. My partner who didn't come to Florida with us also said that there wasn't the 'magic' he had expected to see there although he did say he enjoyed it especially seeing our four year old's 'awe and wonder' reactions   so not all bad. We also all agreed that the firework 'finale' was superb and I certainly got the Disney 'goose bumps' for the first time all day.I am so pleased that we only paid for 1 day as I would not have wanted to go back for a second.day. I won't be going back... but will save extra hard to get back to Florida (in a few years), where, in my opinion' the real Disney 'magic' lives.","Neutral"
"After looking forward to my trip to Disney for months I am extremely saddened to say how disappointed I was in my visit today. We arrived not long after opening time to what I can only describe as chaos. The queues to get in were were so unorganised and never ending and unfortunately that was the story of the full trip. We were there 8 hours and only managed 2 attractions (which weren   t even    must see,    ones. Some rides were    150 min,    wait times which is just insane when they only last a few mins each. There is no sign posts, the map is very difficult to use and despite there being an app, due to the amount of people there the 4G doesn   t work and is therefore, pointless. We were so hungry and thirsty as even the queue for refreshments were 45 mins minimum   we had to leave the park and go to the other end of the village for food and drinks. 30,000 steps later and so upset to say I still don   t really know that    Disney,    is like as after paying    200 I didn   t manage to experience it. I would recommend some vending machines, much more staff to help give instructions and answer guest Qs, more security for incidents, some sort of English translation (I fully appreciate the staff speak in French as their first language but with so many multi national tourists there should be translations especially for safety rules and instructions!) and the fast pass rules need to be changed   this does not work at all ... we bought a fast pass and by 12pm we couldn   t use it as apparently the fast pass was fully booked for the day despite the fast pass lane being empty all day   extremely silly and confusing. To add some positives the park was very clean and beautiful   it certainly has a lot of potential and is visually stunning but so many changes are required to make this a magical visit and I hope the reviews are taken on board to make this happen!","Negative"
"Early September is a good time to go because the queues are shorter, but it can be hot.  I don't think you could come here and not have an awesome time.","Positive"
"we were disappointed to arrive, having paid full fare due to the school holidays, to find that at least 3 major rides  attractions were under maintenance and therefore closed. We had factored in a trip to Paris especially to take our child there after a weeks skiing in Italy, so were disappointed by this   particularly as we paid over 200 Euro for the 3 of us, excluding transport and food.","Neutral"
"We did make the best of it but was not expecting an overly crowded park!Thanks to the fast pass program we were able to ride a few rides that didn't take 55 & 70 mins to wait in line for!The decor was Pumpkin Fall Fabulous & the staff were fabulous!It was disappointing when the show you want to see gets cancelled 3x for technical reasons but I guess it gives you a reason to go back!","Neutral"
"We had a very disappointing experience at Disneyland. My husband needs an ECV because of heath issues, he cannot walk for long periods at a time. Where you have to rent them is a long walk from where you get off the tram. We get inside and there are strollers everywhere. It is so hard to maneuver around them and if you need to park your ECV.... good luck.....I asked one employee where to park it at the Peter Pan ride and he says  It is a 45 minute wait for the ride.  What?!?!?! I told him... I am aware of that, we are willing to wait, where can my husband park his ECV? He says by the stroller parking. Thankfully, he did find a place. We ate in the French Market area for supper and the whole place was messy. The tables were dirty and ground covered with powdered sugar and trash, while about a dozen people working there had ample time to talk and laugh with each other instead of cleaning up the area. The Jungle Ride was a disaster....we waited for 45 minutes to ride and then the employee goes so fast during the ride, you didn't have time to look at anything. People were trying to take pictures and finally gave up. Then when the ride is over, we have to wait to get off because the boats are backed up! Hey... why don't you go slower during the ride that we waited so long for???? We have been to Disneyworld and it is a much better experience. I was expecting the same from Disneyland and we were left disappointed in our experience. We were thinking about going to Disney's California Adventure, but because of our experience here, we didn't want to waste more money by having a bad experience. I have always wanted to come to Disneyland and can say that I have been here, but not worth the money to come back.","Negative"
"I haven't been to this park in 15 years and boy is it different! It's GIGANTIC!!! California Adventure too! They added on a whole new theme park next to the other theme park! Make sure you wear comfortable shoes and I mean running shoes, not flip flops! This park is huge, overpriced, and overcrowded! Best to go during the off season. Half the attractions were closed or the Fast Pass machine wasn't working. There was a two hour wait for every attraction we went on. Maybe I sound like a party pooper but this seems like one monumentally overpriced tourist trap! I will be happy if I never have to go there again! If my son wants to go then we will be going during the off season and I will be having my nephew who works there sign us in, I refuse to pay for that!","Neutral"
"We booked tickets on line for Disneyland, this is something I recommend, the lines were already long when we got there, so booking your tickets in advance does help.I was advised to buy a fast passes, but i decided not to, because it was not clear to me on the website if this also counted as an entrance ticket, meaning; a total price of 90 euro with entrancevinstead or 74 or 68 or an extra 90 euro's, depending on age of child.But even if we would have, the lines were long there as well, and also, what kind of system is this? People that do not have that much to spend will be held back, because people with money obviously can skip the lines...absolutely ridiculous.Getting something to eat was horrible, again lines everywhere...just to eat someting right...And don't get me started on the staff, trying to figure out the amount of 3 icecreams with a small casio computer, and not being able to, or very rude staff. Only 2 ladies were friendly, have to be honest. All in all, very disappointing, long waiting lines, not being able to sit somewhere like a human being, and bad service.Our kids were so disappointed that they wanted to leave.We even heard people saying: 'Never again'.Absolutely not worth the money.","Negative"
"Had a great day at Euro Disney. Considering it was the weekend before xmas it wasn't too busy either Having read some reviews I was aware that the food in the resort is expensive though I was still surprised quite how expensive we found the Golden Nugget to be the best value and nicest location for what we wanted some of the others were pretty nasty particularly the burger bar and the pizza restaurant. Our big disappointment however was the closing firework spectacular. We hung around in the cold and dark for a couple of hours to see the fireworks (the show starts at 10pm on Saturdays) but their was no firework spectacular there were no announcements and no apologies from the resort and we heard lots of other people complaining about their disappointment too. ","Neutral"
"We have been to Disney World five times, and love it. Since we were in CA on Spring Break, decided to try Disneyland. We were very disappointed for a number of reasons. The park is not kept up like Disney World  peeling paint and lack of manicured landscaping, as well as at least 5 closed attractions. The cast members aren't as friendly and the magic that we feel at Disney World just seemed to be lacking. Granted, it was Spring Break, but the lines were horrendous! We didn't get to go on half the rides. I don't think we would go back.","Negative"
"do you like to bleed money? if so then you should visit the parks. Parking $$, food $$, drinks $$. So the next time I will look into staying at the park, that way I don't see all of the money that I'm bleeding.","Neutral"
"they let way to many people into the park at once. 90 min. wait on almost all rides even with the fast pass! it is a rip off to pay all that money and only get to ride 2 or 3 rides in a 9 hour day and walking over 5 miles to get to them only to learn you cant ride. long lines for EVERYTHING. tickets should be sold like a concert, so many on a certain date so everyone can enjoy the attractions! I will never return or visit any other Disney parks because of it.","Negative"
"After visiting Japan for 10 days and Osaka universal studio for a day, we stopped at Hong kong for a brief period of 3 days and tried to experience the Halloween at HK Disney land. We booked tickets through internet and reached the place at 6.30 pm using public transport. While the destination is easily accessible, we failed to get the feeling of Halloween at HK. The Halloween feel at Osaka Universal Studio took a upper hand. After spending time up to midnight and enjoyed some of the rides and night show, the adventure land for Halloween has been a big disappointment.","Neutral"
"Came to celebrate my wife's birthday. She has some health issues which they always accommodated. We don't mind standing in lines but due to my wife's health anything over 20 minutes is a real problem. In the past they would give us a pass that we need to wait 45 120 minutes to get on the ride. Between rides, we would generally people watch.Went to city hall and the employee said if my wife could not stand in line as long as required we should put her in a wheelchair and sit in line. This is problematic due to the sun.After gently discussing this, we asked for the supervisor. Clarissa came and set us up with a pass that allowed us to get a pass for a ride and then wait. Just what we needed.With the exception of the wait staff at River Belle, the employees acted as if they didn't want to be bothered. We don't ask for much, but had general questions regarding the time of different events. Very disappointing.","Neutral"
"One of out top reasons in going to HK. It certainly brings the child in you. Don't expect the rides to be that extreme though. But the shows, parks, everything inside HK Disneyland is so magical. Stay for another half an hour to take pictures when crowd goes lesser. Tip: Book a pass and meal voucher via klook and redeem them at the gates. It's way cheaper and hassle free.","Positive"
"Found it very difficult to get around Disneyland or to try out the attractions due to restricted accessibility. The website gives information about disabled persons having priority accessing attractions. This meant waiting in a queue to be given a time to come back to the attraction. Our visit was worsened when confronted by a very rude staff member who claimed we were late for our ride and we have to return later this despite me standing in the line for 20 minutes. Other attractions, we were told when we arrived at the attraction, had to be booked at 10am in the morning, again no prior warning via website or guest services about this. Sorry, cannot recommend the park to anyone.","Negative"
"We had so much fun. We walked around the whole park and rode almost every ride and just had so much fun","Positive"
"Spent August 7, 2016 with my son, his girlfriend, and one of his co workers at Disneyland. This was truly a magical day. A little planning went into the day, thanks to my son. We learned of the fast pass system and how it worked, THIS IS KEY!!! We also had the disneyland app downloaded to help us navigate and know how long the lines were. We also used the app to filter out rides for adults. Overall we had a plan of attack, read websites on what to bring (sunscreen, food (we stopped at a local grocery store and got sandwich wraps, granola bars, nuts, and veggie straws), water, a cellphone battery pack, and a regular camera so we didn't have to use our cellphones all the time). They did check our bags and allowed our food in....so do this if you can, it really saves on money. We were able to hit all the rides we wanted, saw the parade and the fireworks. I was a great day filled with great memories. P.S. WEAR COMFY SHOES!!!!!","Positive"
"My mistake. I went with big hope of having high thrill rides with big drops and upside down rides. To my surprise it was mainly for small children only and a couple of rides for parents to keep them un bored. Restaurant options are very limited i would say with the scale of name this place has achieved. Overall the theme is catered to shell out as much money from parents as possible to please their children by selling products Mickey branded. ","Neutral"

"I honestly love Disney and the parks are always a blast. Everything is just made perfect and there is beauty in every detail. The problem is, that there seems to be no restrictions (or to high ones) for visitors in the park. Not a single attraction was without a huge waiting time which really ruin the whole experience. But in comparison to Disney in Orlando oder LA the prices are very fair und you really get a lot of value for your money. Not comparable to Disney world where the prices are really out of the world.So to sum up:  waiting times not under 45 minutes even to grab some food  great price and beautiful park","Positive"
"We love to go here again and again. We were too irritated when we had to go there thrice a year to show to our guests; so took a break of 4 5 years and went again.  What a place, too many experiences.","Positive"
"This is a small Disneyland, but it is perfect for a one day event.  The lines to meet the characters weren't too bad which was great because my 2 year old adores Mickey!","Positive"
"The newer ones like Toy Story and Grizzly were the better attractions   better landscape design and rides were more interesting, probably from an adult's point of view. Nonetheless, the Fantasyland area looked quite old and floor was not well maintained, hence failing to give you the wow factor. Characters photo taking at the fantasyland's pavilions was difficult, staff does not promptly advise when would the characters return. We witnessed the characters leave but not the queue, and left us wondering should we exit the queue and return later as we had no idea how long we had to wait for the characters to come back. Most importantly, the experience was dampened whenever you witness people (of a particular nationality) cutting queues. This simply worsen your day.","Neutral"
"July 6   Group of 19 spent a day in Disneyland. What a day, so hot although it rain in between. Everywhere a lot of people, too crowded. You gotta wait for at least 30 minutes for every ride. Wasted a lot of time just waiting.Really enjoyed the fireworks though.","Neutral"
"I took my daughters here off season in March 2014. In many ways it was magical and I am absolutely glad we went. We particularly liked the Peter Pan ride, Big Thunder Mountain, Buzz Lightyear and Dumbo. The parade was fabulous and the Disney Dreams show was truly spectacular. It's worth getting there early for a good seat for both. The queues are awful though. I can't imagine what they are like in the summer holidays. Must be horrific. The food is ridiculously priced and we always took our own. And the smoking in the park is vile. Why aren't there smoking areas? We probably wouldn't go back as we've done it now but for kids aged 5 plus I think its worth one magical out of season visit.","Positive"
"I have just returned from Disneyland Paris and am hugely dissappointed. All of the staff are French and obviously means the service you recieve is poor. They come across rude and not bothered. Everyone smokes in the park so you leave smelling of smoke which cant be good for the children. They even light up in queues for rides so you cant even breath. Some of the rides are soo old and run down you can see the rust. Especially rides like Star Tours and Armaggedon should be closed down as they look like something out of the 90's. The Disney Village is just as bad Planet Hollywood is nothing compared to the London version. Rude waiters and old run down interior. Mcdonalds meals had more taste than Planet Hollywood. I was dissappointed at the overall experience. The queues were crazy and the security at the entrance was a joke. You could easily bypass the bag search by walking around the side and at some times they had no bag search at all. French people have no clue of how to queue and rather than stand in a line at rides and at the entrance they prefer to gather around and push through. The only positive was Val D'Europe the shopping centre near by. Had quite a few shops and resturants which we enjoyed. I would reccomend Disneyland Orlando if you want the real experience. The French have completley lost the idea of Disney.","Negative"
"We've been to Disney land many times so it was the same old thing for us; however, it was fun to watch the experience through the eyes of our grandchildren who had never visited the park. Overall, the day was very nice, albeit crowded, but we had a good time. We returned for the evening at the park and were very disappointed in the crowd control measures used by park employees. Because of fireworks and the Mickey water show, certain areas were cordoned off causing bottlenecks to form as crowds were funnelled through narrow spaces. All the while, park employees are barking orders at the crowd and shouting in people's ears. Many families were upset because kids were crying as they were being pushed along like cattle off to slaughter. With the billions of $$$ that Disney has, you'd think they could come up with a better way to present these evening spectacles so that they didn't have to herd their guests in this way!!","Neutral"
"Going to HK Disneyland for the 1st time was just a breeze. You can take the MTR (yellow line) from central towards sunny bay and transfer to the pink line towards disneyland resort station. Its as simple as following the bright eyed tourists with kids and there's no way you'll miss itAs many other theme parks, there are many spots here that are instagram worthy. They are also famous as backdrops for tv and movie shoots (and i was lucky to see one  fanmode). Rides wise, as an adult I'd say the USS in SG is more exhilarating but hey, Disney is designed for kids afterall and people like me who are kids at heart. If you want the rush, the Space Mountain is a must try. Tarzan's TreeHouse was such a waste of time. You take a short raft ride to the other side, climb the tree house, come down and ride the raft back.. I find it really boring but I still got pics. 2 of the rides in adventureland were under maintenance so that cut our visit short. Buzz Lightyear's ride was also interactive especially designed for kids. Pictures with your favorite Disney characters were also queued on so you have to be quick if you wanted Mickey's pic as its queue could last ages. The place had many restos and shops to choose from... Perhaps the best thing i should say about this trip was the Disney Parades and the fireworks at the end. It sure lived up to expectations and like a kid, i was grinning and smiling and waving like crazy. Make sure you catch the Flights of Fantasy at around 3pm.. but the best one is Mickey's Fantasy of Lights. It was just awesome. Make sure you get a good seat around 5pm and get a good view of Cinderella's Castle as its the best spot to catch the parades as well as the fireworks after. Its an absolute must see.The crowds would be very heavy after the fireworks towards the MTR so its best to stay awhile to maybe get some photos or do some last minute shopping for souvenirs and wait for the crowd to lessen before hitting your way back. Overall, it was a great experience.","Positive"
"I have spent 2 days here one day in each of the parks with my family and we all felt that we could have spent one more day. Get in as early as possible. Both the parks were great. The kids enjoyed all attraction specially California Sceamin,Cars, the miniature world and many other attractions. We deliberately planned it after the new year and in the week when schools were reopening so the crowds were less but still there was no attraction where one could avoid queues. Overall an amazing place for the entire family.","Positive"
"Resort OK'ish' but staff rude and indifferent. Some even pretended not to understand English! ..I'm afraid the French to not know anything about Customer Service and are reluctant to communicate with visitors from the UK. French visitors pushed us aside as if the resort belonged to them and they should have priority. At an ice cream stall it took 5 people to serve 2 tubs of ice cream after a 10 minute wait! Everything was just the poor mans version of Disneyland USA with none of the 'Have a nice Day!' Never again!","Negative"
"Our family enjoys coming here so much. We feel happy and everyone is so friendly. Once in awhile, there is someone not too friendly but that is rare because their service is really top notch.","Positive"
"It's my first time here and all I can say it was absolutely magical and amazing! We had a one day ticket for two parks and I can tell you that one day is not enough. We went to the Disney Park first..A lot to see and do. A long waiting line if you want to hug the different characters. I highly recommend the Pirates of Carribean, Indiana Jones, Big Thunder Mountain and in the Walt Disney Park don't miss the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. I suggests that if you only have one day, go to Walt Disney Studios first and try their rides because they close at 7pm. Go to disneyland park around 4 or 5pm to see the Disney Parade which is really great! after the parade there's only short waiting line to try the different rides so we were able to try a lot more rides in the evening. Last but not the least, end your day with the superb and amazing Disney Dreams  with their fabulous show and fireworks. Be here when the parks open so you can maximise your whole day. Restaurants are expensive but we were able to found a good mexican restaurant in front of the big thunder mountain ride. Their Tacos and Fajitos taste great!","Positive"
"We started out at the haunted mansion and the line went fairly quickly although we waited for an hour. Everywhere you go, the walkways were blocked off because the lines from the rides spilled out. Was there seven hours and got on three rides.  Hyperspace  mountain as it is now called, was the longest line I've waited in my whole life. Two hours pass and we were still only halfway through the line. The people that work there were trying their best to entertain the kids in the center with hopscotch and such so I applaud them for trying. The parade congested things up and we would have to go around the whole park or wait for a break in the parade. Definitely don't want to come back during Christmastime.","Negative"
"We are a diehard Disney family, visiting at least once a year, but this visit was miserable. The park was crowded, producing long waits on all the rides and the weather was unseasonably hot to add to the misery. Crowds and weather cannot be controlled by Disney but their cast members can and should be. I have never had a cast member be anything but pleasant to me and rudeness seems to be the new norm. I am not a fan of the crowd control techniques either. At both the parade and Fantasmic, standing is required to squeeze in more people. A group that had been sitting for almost two hours for the parade was required to stand before the parade start despite the fact that there was no clamor to join the viewing. It was infuriating because eight rows deep, everyone could see perfectly. After standing, only the first two rows could see. Tall people and children on shoulders made viewing from three rows back obstructed at best. After the parade, everyone was sent on a forced march around the trail behind Big Thunder. If Disney is going to force people to make this trek in the dark, they need to install adequate lighting. The Fastpass system for Fantasmic is a nightmare of jostling angry crowds who have no hope of getting a good view. Only those with deep enough pockets to shell out for a dining experience could get a reserved seat with decent viewing. Shade structures or more shade trees and fans are desperately needed on some rides for guests standing in long lines on hot days. New, cool things included the castle decked out for the 60th anniversary and the new light parade. The new Frozen area on the Storybook boat ride is well done as well. None of this made up for being treated poorly by employees at every turn.Oh and be careful about traveling in September and October. Park hours were curtailed on three of our five days for the Halloween party. The number of hours we could be In the park was substantially reduced, although, of course there was no price reduction at gate.","Negative"
"With a week of Paris and sightseeing, we decided to surprise our little one with a day trip to Disneyland Paris. In summary: really not worth the visit, your money, or your time.I was prepared for the cigarette smoke from reading various reviews   there was a lot of smoke (and a lot of smoking stations). What I was not prepared for was the    meh    attitude throughout the park. It certainly didn   t feel like the happiest place on earth and felt more like life was on pause and everything was passing by! From the ride operators, to the restaurant workers, to the gift shop stores... no one smiled, no one greeted you, and certainly no one helped you! There was even a person handing out candy, but he was being selective as to what kids would get it and he was actually being rude! Our child was terrified to ask for the candy. It was the strangest experience I have ever witness at a place that is suppose to be geared towards kids and families and FUN! Then to leave an even more sour taste.... when we got back to our hotel in Paris (45min train ride), we noticed that the 60Euro plushie we bought had a 3inch rip on one of the legs. We reached out to Disney Paris   s twitter help account. They did respond quickly, but with a    fill out this form   . Once you fill out the form, you get an automated response that it will take up to 15  days for them to respond. Here I was thinking Disney is Disney is Disney... and they would courier a replacement to our hotel (and pick up the damaged one) before we leave, but I was SO VERY WRONG. This is not the Disney World service we are used to! It   s been several days since we reported our damaged item and there has been nothing but crickets. We even tried the Disney Store in Paris, but the store said it   s a separate company and they can not help other than give us paperwork to fill out and for us to ship the product back (at our expense) and wait for a refund. Whaaaat? Such a sour taste left our mouths with this crappy experience.Needless to say, those who only know Disneyland Paris and eventually visit make a visit to Florida   s Disney World must have their minds blown because Disney World is a complete 180 from the Paris    meh    park!!","Negative"
"The park was pretty busy as usual, but after 6pm.. the halloween experience was awesome! There are so many great stations and villains for picture taking. The fireworks are crazy good and the parade was cool! Who doesn't want to see a headless horseman? I'd go back for sure!!","Positive"
"they don't have as many rides as other Disneys.  Easy to get to.  Charge a fortune for bag storage but there are cheaper lockers if your bag is not big. Castle is still being built so not great yet.","Negative"
"Ours was a birthday treat, a 50th but to bring the whole family, youngest 4, and some young adults. We started as soon as we go off the train, bags sent to the hotel, we sent to the park for the first ride.It is difficult to keep a 4 year old and young adults amused at exactly the same time, but it worked well for us, splitting up and rendezvous later. The rides are good, but don't take too long, and the queue's are a nightmare. You have to be patient, not mind kids bumping into you, swinging on the bars that separate the lines etc, make sure you have some shade, food and water to keep you going... all just to get to the ride. So queue's, rides, lots and lots of people are all the kind of things you must expect coming to such an attraction, but this is clearly not for everyone. The waiting time can be a killer, the push and shove generally (just lots of people in the same space) can be daunting enough, the cultural differences of 'queue discipline' to endure etc   you really need to be in the right frame of mind to survive....but then there are the prices. : ( You can't come to Disney without some serious money in my opinion. Just as an example for some item prices, your average bottle of cold drink, cola or lemonade is just over    3   there are free water fountains around, so bring a water bottle to fill up. A meal from one of the fast food places will cost a minimum of    10  a head, and these are not huge meals. Some interesting variety but not 'fantastique'   so whatever the exchange rate you need to do the maths, but I just think in   's and compare. For me an 'average' McD's meal deal in the UK is about what you are getting at the fast food outlets, UK price would be about   3.50, Disney price is   10     15 depending on what you order. The cheapest pint (50 cl) of beer I could find was    6.59 (Krone 1664)   the cheapest bottle of wine was    19.99   so what was a 'basic (but nice) meal of good burgers in a proper restaurant (Planet H) for 7 of us was   170. Thats one meal, and we stayed for 5 days. A trick is to eat well at breakfast (stuff yourself) and slip in a extra couple of rolls or croissants in your bag to keep you topped up during the day.We were lucky with the weather, nice hot and sunny, and we had a lot of fun for sure. So prepare your minds and expectations and bring a lot of money and Mickey will take care of the rest.","Positive"
"We went on rides and ate and got character signatures. We did so much, I was exhausted at the end of the day. The kids loved all the different rides, as did I. And we all got hats, some with mouse ears, some not; and t shirts, and stuffed animals as take home mementos. There was so much to do, it was difficult to make a decision of what to do next. The youngest (7 and 10) enrolled in the JEDI TRAINING and part of that was dueling with DARTH VADER and other characters of the dark side. FUN FUN FUN!!","Positive"
"I love Disneyland, but my last experience with my twin, 8 year old nieces was not good. There were way too many people in the park and the lines were too long. We paid over $500 and only got on 3 rides during the entire day. They need to find a solution to this problem during the busy months,","Negative"
"Closed:Pirates, Mr Lincoln, Safari boat ride and Indiana jones.Went to the town hall to complain had to wait in line....they then told me to fill out online.Paid 2 adults 1 child almost $400. To watch obese Americans eat cakes, ice cream, etc.According to my child it was a great day.","Negative"
"Although we had a great time celebrating my baby granddaughter's 1st birthday on Sunday, January 26, most of us developed the Norovirus this week and were very sick. The baby was the first two days later to start the vomiting, fever, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Next, her mom and grandmother got it two more days later. We had lunch at Caf   Orleans and the baby had the apples and carrot sticks (something else with that menu item, maybe pasta). Anyway, we would like to see the resort do a better job of food safety. I had to go to Urgent Care yesterday to rehydrate with an IV. This is the virus that has affected several cruise ship passengers recently. When I called Disneyland to inform them of the incident, the operator put me through to Guest Experience and no one picked up the call. I will be calling the Health Department also.","Negative"
"I get that Disney is a business and is there to make money, however, I feel annoyed by the implementation of the Max Pass. We spend thousands travelling to Disney, pay the entry fee and they are still after more (I understand that Universal are the same). I feel as though Disney has lost some of its shine. Long, long lines and little movement for spontaneity. Whilst I did love Disney, I think it will be a long time before I return to Disneyland Anaheim. The app was useful for checking ride times.","Positive"
"We have 3 daughters aged 5,8 and 10 but the two younger girls made full use of the buggy which we had to dust down from the shed. Very tiring trip for all of us but fun nonetheless. Best ride by far was Thunder mountain, followed by pirates of the Caribbean.","Positive"
"overpriced for what you get... nothing but stores to spend money in. They should include both parks for the price of one. I feel sorry for family with kids","Neutral"
"So had a day to kill after a week in Paris decided to check this out because it was close and it was a nice day. Not sure if this place is seasonal or not but I have to say it seemed like it was extremely short staffed. Waited in line for food and rides. How does the hot dog stand run out of hot dogs. Lucky if we got four rides in. Empty restaurants and told to come back in an hour to check still empty and still no seating. My only thought was not enough food on hand or employees to work. Overall wished I didn't go or spend the money. Would never return.","Negative"
"We booked our 2days pass tickets in UK via the web site before our holiday in HK. It's really for our 3year old daughter as I've been to the one in Paris and Florida and thought it would be nice to spend some family time in a magical place.Good job we got a 2days pass as the following attractions rides were out of order: lion king show, run away mine train and slinky ride at toy story land. Hopefully lion king show will be available on our 2nd visit.Didn't realise you have to obtain some form of token to be able to join the queue to take photos with the Frozen characters so when we arrive at the area at 2pm we were told all token pass for the day have been all given out and we will have to come back another day.Fingers cross we can get a token on our 2nd visit tomorrow. Overall the Disney experience isn't one of my best in HK, and the park isn't big enough to spend a whole day with the family.","Negative"
"My family and I went during the summers and we could not enjoy because of the intense heat. Disney land looked really nice and fun but we were unable to go around enough. What we enjoyed was the small world ride! It was a truly wonderful experience :) For anyone who wants a good experience i recommend not to go during the hot season!!","Neutral"
"Disneyland is always a good place to visit. This is my second time in Paris location and I think overall tenth times in a Disney park. Normally I will give five stars. One star is deducted because one third of the rides are closed for refurbishment. This is to school holiday week and closing almost all top attractions just doesn't make sense. I wonder what they did during winter. A side effect is that a number of roads are also closed and there were not enough signages to direct people. I believe when such a huge part of the park is closed I believe at least a discount in ticket prices or some additional character sightings  other attractions can be good compensation. Instead I believe there was a shortage of staff and character sightings were quite limited and finished early. For this I took off one star. Second star is lost due to official mobile application. Sorry to remind that but Disney is a media company. Maybe you can follow some new technologies and trends in media. Mobile application is not copying the brochure to telephone. The us park applications are much better although still not that good. One final thing. Elsa is your biggest hit. Maybe she deserves her own ride. Instead of refurbishment, I believe kids would enjoy some new stuff.","Neutral"
"Very, very small compared to the other Disney properties.  Still as a Southern Californian from the 50's, It was a bit of nostalgia.  OP is a better choice if your on a tight schedule, but do it if you can.","Neutral"
"Was expecting to find everything failing apart after the scare stories coming out earlier in the year.The only thing I could see that needed some attention is all the bodged looking repairs on the pavements.The castle looked fantastic, and the pirates of the carribean ride, phantom manor and big thunder mountain are all superior to their Florida counterparts.It would be nice to see Disney develop the area over by the pirates side of the park, it feels a bit barren.Overall well worth a visit.","Positive"
"Went to Disneyland with my 2 kids , for them was good... For me a disappointment comparing with Orlando, shops and people who works there weren't friendly at all, games  entertainment looks old and needs upgrade, food in the park is really bad and expensive.,the big show was not what I expect from a Disney show.., that for a 60th anniversary???I will not take the kids again.. Not worth it.","Neutral"
"Having visited Anaheim and Hong Kong parks this is a poor cousin.Rides that don't operate, long lines (even with fast pass), difficult to find places to buy drinks. Very unfriendly staff who can't be bothered to learn English (it is an English tourist attraction so basic words should be mandetory)Save your money and go elsewhere.","Neutral"
"Just got back from Disney land Paris and over all we had a great time. The rides are exhilarating and the night time firework display was lovely, emotional even. However, I want to mention a few things that I feel could do with improving.Firstly, when you arrive by train the Disney station could be any station in the world. nothing special about this place at all. It comes with tramps and weed smokers just like any other train station both parks look and feel tired. They seem too small for the amount of visitors they cram in and it's almost like they have lost their Disney magic.You will be hard pressed to find a ladies toilet that doesn't smell of urine, doesn't have wee all over the toilet seat, isn't blocked up and supplies soap to wash your hands. The toilets are so important yet I'm sorry to say all the ones I used were in poor condition. Cracked tiles and broken locks, disregard for any queue and a real sense of  get me the hell out of her ASAP  was my experience.The lines are big and the queue times can be well over an hour yet some people are not prepared to wait. The amount of pushing in is phenomenal and is totally over looked by staff. It gets annoying. What's also annoying is the food service. You wait in a long line for one server to very slowly take your order. We all know it costs a fortune to eat at these places but why do they only have one person taking the orders? People want to eat and go but getting food was a real ball ache.We saw Tigger and Eeyore and that was it. Characters don't walk around. Again, you have to queue up to meet the ones you want to see.Generally we had a great time, the highlight for me was my boyfriend proposing during the end of the firework display. However, I got the impression that Disney land Paris is the poor relation. Really does need a spruce up and a bit more TLC.","Neutral"
"Visited Disneyland Paris in Oct 2017. Purchased tickets from official Disneyland website 2 weeks beforehand. 1 day, 2 parks. Expensive but worth it. V little queuing on arrival to get through ticket desk at 10am (maybe 10 mins but moved quickly). Recommend using fastpass & booking for fav ride as soon as you get in. (Thunder mountain was ours) and then get into queue for 2nd fav ride which given early time shouldn't be v long wait. You do need to be organised & plan out rides beforehand to get on as many as possible. Fastpass is brilliant (given a ticket & time to return..... but you cant book it for another ride   attraction until 1.5 hrs later...then book your next slot.....in the meantime you have to queue for others). Went at mid term and I think French on hols at that time too. Very busy but Queues were ok. Longest wait was 1 hr (without fastpass) and that was in eve. Spent most of our time in park but did head over to studios later in day. Brilliant rides there too.....haunted hotel & finding nemo rollercoaster .....not enough hours in the day to be honest!! Ate at rainforest cafe (highly recommend) around 8pm and returned for fireworks at 10pm. A brilliant day. Memories to last a lifetime. Stayed 15 min walk away in beautiful airbnb apartment. I would love to return!!","Positive"
"Thought we could sneak in on an off Tuesday evening in October for a nice evening. Arrived around 5:00pm and found lines at the parking garage. First strike, at the security line they were searching ladies purses. I walked past and had a female  cast member  start yelling at me that I needed to get back in line. I pointed out that did not have a purse (I'm a male). She continued to yell at me...even after I had gotten back in line. We paid the entire daily admission $99.00 per person for just 5 hours, but we knew that for the start. The place was packed, it seemed like there was a large number of people leaving, but just about the same number arriving. All of the Fast Passes were already taken and the booths were closed. Wait times: River Cruise   35 minutes, Haunted Mansion   45 minutes (this ride kept breaking down), Pirates of the Caribbean   50 minutes, Space Mountain   50 minutes. Long lines at all of the restaurants and you could barely walk without running into the crowds. Around 7pm we were able to get close to a restaurant and had a very nice sit down dinner. Close time was 10pm and the crowds never died down. Orlando is so much bigger and they seem to do a much better job of crowd control.","Neutral"
"Impressive when you walk in, but that was were it ended, wasted most of the day either walking around trying to find everything or lining up for up to 45 minutes, not impressed.","Negative"
"Many years ago I visited this park and had a great time. No major cues, great normal food and a clean park. Today I returned with my wife. What a change. An extremely expensive entrance fee   110 usd per perspn   and for what? The park was overcrowded from 10.30. Long cues to every attraction (more than one hour   EACH place). Fastpass? Well, you could ask for a fastpass and get a ride many hours later. I tried it twice. First time at 11am   fastpass to 2.45 pm!! Next time at 1.50pm (i was not allowed to as for an earlier pass) this time I got a ride at 11.15 pm!!! Felt so sorry for the many kids ...No decent food was obtainable. The few ordinary restaurants were fully booked the whole day. The rest of  restaurants  were serving junkfood. Filth and garbage was found on the streets everywhere. Greed has overtaken this old gem. Apparently the park lets far too many people in to get a great profit. What a pity   and total loss of a lot of money for the visitors. So sad. Walt Disney must be turning in his grave ...","Negative"
"Please understand this is coming from someone who lived half way between Knott's Berry Farm and Disneyland. I went to Disneyland the day it opened July 15 1955. I've watched grow, live and die. It was called DISNEYland for a reason. It was the dream of Walt Disney, repleat with HIS characters. There was no lilo and stitch, no beauty and the beast. It has become a joke and a not very funny one at that. Stupid comes to mind when I think of all the characters the idiots have come up with to pass off as disney character, And now star wars, that needs to be part of a new theme park, Lucasland, NOT Disneyland. Sorry Walt, they didn't know what they were doing when they crushed your dream.","Negative"
"This is a hard review to write. Being the Disney enthusiast I am. Let me start what I liked.1  Space Mountain 2.... Put Space Mountain and Rockin Roller Coaster together .... Ya.... It's that good ! 2  If the workers had a hard time understanding you, they found someone who did.3  The restaurant staff was accommodating. We didn't have a reservation but they did their best to and did.Ok. The not so good.1. When you walk into WDW, all the cast members are greeting everyone...   Hello Princess, Happy Birthday Princess, Happy Anniversary   .... It's the little things 2. Mickey Waffles, Mickey Pretzels, Mickey Ice Cream, Mickey Rice Krispie treats.... Nowhere to be found ! 3. When Confetti cannons go off in MK, staff is out cleaning up. Not so in Paris.... I found it kind of dirty.The worst one 4. When walking out of the park to the parking lot ....All the peddlers are there selling there cheap tchotchkes. Nothing dumbs down and cheapens the whole entire experience .( and PS, in WDW there are smoking zones. Well in Paris, the whole park is a smoking zone )We did it and we can say we did... But it's very difficult when WDW has set that bar so high.","Neutral"
"Disneyland Paris is getting very tired. On the day we were there several rides broke down, it didn't help that we had been standing in line for quite some time and then told that the ride had been stopped. The staff were sloppily dressed and unenthusiastic. Food was expensive and awful and service slow and unhelpful. I went to Disneyland in America and it was fabulous, rides worked, staff were friendly and helpful and the whole place magical. Disneyland Paris could do with a bit more magic.","Negative"
"If you've been to the USA Disney parks then you will almost certainly be disappointed with Disneyland Paris. Although a lot of the rides are improved versions of the USA ones, the staff are not as welcoming as in the USA and the place just does not have the same atmosphere. There is a distinct lack of 'Disney Magic' which is present in the American Parks. People smoke anywhere and everywhere, including in lines for young kids' rides like Peter Pan. It is a very expensive holiday and with the high cost of food I would consider paying a bit more and go to somewhere like Florida.","Neutral"
"We did not visit the adventure park so i would not know about that, but  disnayland California  was the most disapointing experience of our LA vacation. Everyhing seemed so worn out and the park itself is quite small. Apart from Pirates of the Caribian and Mystery Mansion (which was ok) the main attraction is a Starwars simulator, which dont compare at all to what you will find at Universal Studios 3d simulators. The park does not compare to Eurodisnay (which is great) our own (Denmark's) Tivoli or EuropaPark. The latter is the greatest park i have ever attended. Save your money and stay away from this disapointing last Century theme park.","Negative"
"The Disneyland Park was so awesome. I really enjoyed my dinner at River Belle Terrace and I loved the show Fantasmic!!","Positive"
"The place is simply amazing, just had 4 packed days of superb entertainment. I cant wait to go back. I didn't even mind the long queue's because this is something you would come to expect. I also expected to spend a small fortune on food and merchandise but I was very disappointed with the food in the park, You would expect it to be decent for the price but the hot dogs tasted of supermarket value, the pizzas were like they came out of a microwave and the coffee was un drinkable. The only saving grace was the Earl of the Sandwich located just outside the park but that meant walking outside the park. Although you don't go to Disney for the food, it would be nice to see some food stalls cooking fresh take away food, could only seem to get a tub of popcorn at 9 euros each.","Positive"
"Let me preface this by saying that I've made close to 30 trips to Disneyland and to Walt Disney World. I've always been impressed by the Disney brand and it's dedication to quality. I'm working outisde the US, and when I got a chance to take a trip I thought I'd include Disneyland Paris. Bad idea. What I found out later is that the Disney Corporation does not own the Disney parks outside the US. They rent the names and some of the attraction names. I haven't been to any of the other non US parks, but this park was alrgely an embarrassment to Walt's name. To begin with, the customer service was lousy. When something bad happens in Walt Disney World, they let you know, they give you an idea what to expect, and they try to make it up to you. In PAris, I was in the next batch getting ready to board a ride when it (apparently) broke. They Left us sitting there. After 20 minutes they came and gestured at us to get off the ride, but still didn't explain, even when we asked whether we should wait to reboard. It was almost forty minutes before someone told us that we should leave the building. To make matters worse, when I reported this to Disneyland Paris, their response was  Customer safety is our top priority. In general, the rides are pale versions of what we have in the states, again with mostly the name only intact. For instance, the Indiana Jones ride in California is a state of the art motion simulator with amazing special effects. The Indiana Jones ride in Paris is a cheap roller coaster with painted flats for scenery.Overall, this park is the equivalent of the cheaper theme parks in the US. The Disney name does not belong on it. If you go, be forewarned.","Negative"
"Travelled with my 6 year old and also had a 1 year old toddler on a pram! Luckily, it was a low traffic dya and not to hot too. Here are a few highlights and tips :  * Took the subway and DONT mis the Disney...More","Positive"
"Had we gone when everyone was out of school, would have likely been disappointed overall. The ride waits weren't horrible if you knew how to use Fastpasses. They were changing the system while we were there, so make sure you read up on what's new if you haven't been in a while. The cost is inordinate  from the entrance to the food to the junk (aka souvenirs). Glad my son understands prices and budgets. The one quote on this topic that will stick with me was from some poor dad: I just paid $14 for 4 small bottles of water, and $16 for 4 churos.

"Just got back from a four day trip, we expected it to be busy being the school holidays but it was unbelievable the waits for most rides were more than 100 minutes and when you eventually got to the front of the queue the ride broke down, this happened to us twice on big thunder mountain ! And the tram tour off for a whole morning.The food prices have soared since we were there a few years ago, so take your own food in as the queues for that are unbelievable.Very disappointing trip for us and our 10 year old daughter as we did not manage to do all the rides even in the time we were there.","Negative"
"Except the fact that the kids love seeing Mickey Mouse and friends (it also happens that they are scared to see them in reality) and enjoy the merry go round, everything is amazingly expensive and you are queued for a long time everywhere... only few merry are made for adults, so if you also want to enjoy your day: book a journey at EUROPAPARK it is cheaper all the family will have fun but you won't see the Mickey Mouse...","Neutral"
"Second year in a row i came with my 8 years old and 14 years old and I   m not impressed. First time i thought maybe I   ll give them the benefit of doubt , maybe we came in their off season but this time i realize it   s just the way they do business here. Been to other Disney land and Disney world and it   s a lot different. Lack of staff is surprising. No photographers in sight for family pictures but they still sell you a photo pass for 70   .They close all the bathrooms 1 hour before the fireworks and only 2 are open on each end of the park which is ridiculous. The Disneyland Hotel is suppose to be 4 or 5 stars? More like 3 to me. Needs major revamping. Food is not good but they charge like a 5 star restaurant. Wifi internet doesn   t work 90% of the time and when it does it   s really slow. Not more than 10 tv channels. Staff at the hotel are nice i must say. They really sell on the whole magical thing but if you   re going to pay over 12000    for a 5 day stay with nothing included then I   d rather get the bang for my buck.","Neutral"
"Have just returned from a 3 day visit to disney and i will never be back the previous reviews about short queues here must have had there eyes closed the queuing times is beyond the joke most of which were over 45 to 60 min the fast pass queues on rides like thunder mountain were shorter but still having a 30 min wait. The park was totally chock a block you could hardly get moving with very arrogant people not caring that you walking with a buggy they just walk right in front of you and push in front.If you are thinking of going here to see the characters then i wouldn't waste your money in the 3 days at park we seen 5 characters standing in parts of the park we managed to get pic and autograph from pluto as queue was short rest of them were to long to wait in especially for a 2 year old if you wanted to see mickey you had to go to a building as he was never walking around the park and the wait time was over and hour. We found that we were able to get on some rides like small world and teacups in fantasyland around 9pm as this was when people were starting to wait at the castle to see the light show at the close of park 11pm which i must admit was the only good thing about the park however again you have very rude people that turn up 5 min before start and squeeze in front and block your view it is deinitly a must see but if staying in disney partner hotels i would suggest just skipping the shuttle bus back and walk instead as bus is manic we stayed at the kyriad and this was only a 25 min walk Disney village.The price of food and juice is extortion i thought we were dear in britian but after being here our prices are nothing.3.19 euro for bottle of juice but if you go to rainforest cafe shop there it is 2.50 euro or 2 for 4 euro. There is also a shop in the train station that is a bit better prices.Also if you are a smoker take them with you we were over 8 euro for 20.For being a tourist attraction that has been open for over 20 years you would think the standards and service would be better the staff can hardly understand or speak English, the toilets in the park are disgusting filthy and stinking.I wish i just saved a bit more and went to Florida instead I went before when younger and loved it i just chose to go to dlp as daughter is only 2 and thought with it being smaller and shorter journey wold have been better biggest mistake of my life.","Negative"
"Disneyland Paris was awful. I recommend never going. Lines for anything  Don't Miss  were over 60 minutes and it wasn't a public or school holiday. Many, many things closed including a restaurant that didn't have a sign on it at all and we weren't the only people waiting for it to open at 11:55am. Then had to queue for food and toilets. At 12:30 the children's menu had run out at the Mexican place   it's a children's themepark!!. Our7 year old thought that the tacos that we did eventually get were delicious so that was a minor bonus. The buildings were tired and in need of paint. There was nothing magical about Disney at all! The final insult was just as we were leaving (after having been there for 7 hours and been on 4 rides   total ride time approx 12 minutes and wait time hours   they announced a spectacle on Mainstreet that sounded a like a parade so kids got set up and ready to see at least something spectacular but it was just ONE horse drawn cart with a movie character in it. Kids 14, 10 and 7 didn't enjoy Disneland at all   what a waste of a day!!!","Negative"
"Disney is a terrific place with lots to commend it. Parades, shows, people, organisation all very good. However 6 rides closed in Magical Kingdom and 2 rides in California Adventure park very disappointing. Even worse was that other rides kept breaking down. Yet the ticket prices were the same high prices. Sad to say but despite lots of things to credit the park on this is no longer value for money. Too expensive to have so many rides out of action at the same time and all the other ones including some of the newer rides (like Cars) breaking down and being closed for long periods during the day.Also a hint if you are just going for the fireworks display, then save your money, and go to an Angels game on a Saturday night. Fireworks there are spectacular and beat Disney easily. You can get outfield tickets for about $15 to $20 I think. We paid $30 for semi decent seats but we wanted to see the game too.","Negative"
"I just visited DisneyLand in Ca on 8 3 15. Technology is not the way to go at the front gate. Print your tickets!!!! I tried to use ticket in my email to enter the gate and had multiple problems. The scanner cannot read the bar code and as a result we were penalized. After waiting in line 30 minutes, we were told to go to another line and the attendant yelled at us in front of all the guest for going to the front of the line, which we were told to do, after 45 frustrating minutes finally they let us in even thought are bar code would not work. Also there is a good amount of abuse with people not wanting to wait in the lines and claiming disabilities. So I found the walking people are penalized because of all the fraud and people working the system. The attendants working the line seem to be overwhelmed and frustrated. I think Walt would be disappointed!!!!!","Neutral"
"Having brought a 2 day pass online before travelling, the start of a 3 week tour of cities in Europe we went to the ticket office to pick them up the staff informed us we needed 2 forms of photographic identity they were arrogant and inflexible even showing the paperwork and email on our phone confirming it.The park itself is celebrating its 20th anniversary and it looks like it hasn't been maintained since day one, the rides are old and uninspired, the disney characters were few and far between no Mickey or Minnie.Even though we had no children with us, we had wanted to visit whilst in Paris, the day was sunny and warm and refreshment was needed, a 330ml bottle of coke was    6.50 !!!! 4x the cost of petrol, The soft toys and figures in the shop expensive and everything made in China ??? Come on Disney do us all a favour and STOP Ripping of families.    79 a day entry why?","Negative"
"Really disappointed with the attitude of cast members at this park. I paid $17 to park in one of the car parks, we were directed to Simba at the end of Downtown Disney near the Disneyland Hotel. This is a very long walk to the main entrance to the park in very hot weather. You can access Tomorrowland from the Monorail Station located in Downtown Disney. It was at this point that I noticed a sign saying  No Selfie Sticks  I approached the security bag search area and was informed that I needed to return this to the car or check it in at lost and found property at the Main Gate. The stick is for my Sony Action Camcorder rather than a mobile device. I asked the cast member why they had put up signs at the entrance to the car park and also along the footpath as you exit the car park. At this point another rather rude cast member said haven't you seen it on TV, my reply was obvious no otherwise I wouldn't have brought it. I was then faced with another long walk to the main entrance to the park, where I was met with another cast member who struggled to get me to fill out a label and then attach it to my property. Lots of people were bringing in selfie sticks. Whilst I accept the reason why they are banned from the park, I do take issue with allowing people to walk around the park in queues for rides with umbrellas when it is a really hot day. This is far more dangerous in a very crowded park. In 12 hours we only saw one character, Goofy just before the parade. When I visited the park back in 2009 we saw loads and my boy obtained lots of autographs. Having visited DisneyWorld Florida back in 2013 this was a far better experience.Not sure what is going on California but this park needs some attention.I only met two cast members who were extremely helpful during the visit.Very disappointed!","Negative"
"Getting there was easy as pie, being from another country. Caught the train to Disneyland station and the Park was just a few steps away.I was excited at first, but that soon changed as time went on. It didn't feel like there was magic and it was a lot smaller to what I was expecting.We lined up for a ride, as it said that it was only going to be a 20min wait. We ended up in line for almost an hour and then even before we could get on, the ride had to be closed. We gave up on trying to go on rides after that as the lines were way too long.The only good thing was that we decided to eat lunch early. So we managed to beat the lunch rush.In the end we just took a lot of photos. There were just too many people. You will need more than 1 day if you want to go on all the rides.At least I can say that I had stepped foot in Paris Disneyland.","Negative"
"Having visited Disneyland Paris some 25 years ago we decided to spend the last day of our holiday at Disneyland Hong Kong. The rides were outdated and given HK love of all things electronic we expected more. There was a greater variety of rides in Paris. The parades started late   so we missed the last few minutes of the evening parade as we had a coach pick up to meet. The parades were not a patch on Paris some 25 years agoThe majority of the staff were rude and unhelpful   unlike the Paris staff. Given that English is widely spoken in HK a lot of the staff barely understood English. Putting it mildly it was an utter disappointment from start to finish.","Negative"
"Hi everyone,I am allergic to wheat, and when I went to the Blue Bayou for dinner the chef came out and I ordered what was supposed to be gluten free food.

It was extra sad because my boyfriend proposed that day, but we were not able to stay and celebrate because I was so sick. :(","Negative"
"i went to disneyland france with my 2 kids: ages 13 and 9.we had a great time! i looked for tickets for a long time  and finally decided to purchase online from the disneyland site. they have a great offer  3 days for the price of 2 days for both parks. we were there for 2 days  the first day we went to the park and the second day to the studios.since the studios close at 19:00   we went to the park again.dont miss the parade at the park. amazing! and do not miss the car show in the studios! all the resort is very clean; lots of restaursnts. we had a great time!!! dont forget to use the fast pass  great idea!and if you are travelling with young children  you can rent a stroller :)","Positive"
"it is a real Disneyland park with all the attractions, but unfortunately almost one third of the attractions where out of service due to renovations.... the lines to the existing attractions were too long (for off season period) and you cannot find a descent coffee shop  only Automatic machines, but the parade in the afternoon and the fireworks in the evening are wonderful and exciting","Neutral"
"Attended for short break at end of school holidays. Paid a lot for the break and added extra to have a uprated room in newport hotel and  full board  plus meal plan. The hotel was nice but the room it's self was shocking. Very dated, basic and run down, at a push 2* at most and I'm hardly fussy. Spoke to staff who said theyre all the same! Food plan was far to complicated. Breakfast was a joke, then hard to find somewhere to eat without reservations and no menus to pre plan and with a very fussy child it was impossible! Then the park. So over crowded it was a joke. All about generating revenue rather than an experience. Couldn't see the shows or attractions and ride waiting times of over 70minutes!! A place aimed at children how on earth do they see this as acceptable? My boys are good but like me anything over 30mins takes its toll. First day we achieved around 4 rides!! I know companies like to earn a profit but at the customers cost? I could understand if it was   20 a day but it's well over that!! We were all disappointed about the trip, the boys talk more about the ferry trip over than the holiday!! And to top it off, 4 emails later and still not even an acknowledgement!! Added to this still no response to the two emails I sent before the trip. It's clear they're all about profit and not an experience for customers. Save your cash as make your own entertainment!!","Negative"

"Like each of the Disney Parks around the world, HK Disneyland makes you smile from the time you walk through the gates until the time you leave. Not as big as its US cousins, but a good selection of rides. Modern, clean, easy to get to from HK. And, provided you stay clear of HK and China holidays, MUCH shorted queues than other Disney Parks. Well worth a visit if you are travelling to HK.","Positive"
"Fabulous day at Disneyland. Food and Drinks can be very expensive so pack your own drinks and snacks. When Disneyland is open until midnight please be careful. We were literally at a still at New Orleans area, people were packed in like sardines at 2230hrs. It was very dangerous! They rope of areas for paying people to have front row seats.","Positive"

It is not  5 yrs old little kid friendly at all like the hype would have you believe where Disney Land is for little kids. Long wait times for even the crappy rides!","Negative"
"My husband and I visited Disneyland on a Sunday. It was so crowded. Maybe it   s less crowded during the week, but that   s just the way our schedule landed us. We got there around 10 am. There were lines just to get in line. Security. Tickets. Dining. Rides. And even though we had the fast pass, sometimes the ride would be unavailable (breakdowns)and your time slot disappeared. Oh well. You got to see Disneyland once. I   ll go back to Orlando, but not Anaheim.","Neutral"
"First off, I was disappointed. I love the Disney Parks, having been to Disneyland in CA several times & WDW in FL many, many times I was surprised by my own level of disappointment. I am into Disney's customer service, theme ing, attractions & food. I'm a fan! That said, Disneyland Paris did not meet my expectations in customer service or upkeep. It looked run down in many areas, it was unorganized, in terms of lack of queues for characters, timing for shows & parades(20 mins late, twice). The characters looked a bit shabby, like they get the hand me down character costumes from WDW. If you've never been to WDW, this park may seem acceptable for a Disney fix, but if you've visited Disney Parks in the States you WILL be disappointed. While my family & I did have fun at this park, if we were to return we would make it a day trip from Paris. The attractions were fun to experience, we enjoyed comparing them to the ones we've been on in other parks, most of the attractions were better than the ones in WDW, but again the poor upkeep was distracting from the magic. Phantom Manor, Big Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Space Mountain:Mission 2 were all wonderfully themed and beautiful, except for the lack of upkeep. It was fun to hear British accents on Princesses like, Snow White, Anna, Elsa & Jasmine. My family loved experiencing attractions in French, in fact they preferred that over the English options even though they don't understand French at all.  In regards to Cast Members, I wouldn't say they were rude, I would say that most seemed indifferent to interact with guests, not like WDW at all. So again if you are expecting Disney service like we are used to in the States, forget it! Their attitude may have had something to do with the way they were treated, I saw many guests being rude to Cast Members, acting like they own the place, talking down to them & not trying to speak French at all. Another note on guests, they smoke, they smoke a lot, there are smoking areas but nobody seems to use them. We saw many Europeans smoking around kids without concern & smoking on lines while waiting for the rides. This was hard to get used to since our family tries to live a healthy lifestyle & having to breathe in second hand smoke was not ideal. It was disappointing of Disney & their Cast Members to not make more of an effort to move smokers to their designated smoking area. The only time I heard an attempt was while at the Tower of Terror, when a guest decided to light up at the entrance to the lobby of the ride, a recorded announcement was made over the loud speaker & he extinguished his cigarette after one last puff. To our surprise we enjoyed the food, we weren   t sure what to expect and we were pleased that they were very accommodating with my kids' gluten allergy. We thought food presentation was artistic, the menu's variety sufficient enough to appeal to all 6 of us, the food's quality & taste were all superior to WDW (Sorry, WDW foodies). Transportation was easy enough, with buses running regularly & everything in decent walking distance. My husband & son often walked to & from the parks from our hotel, Newport Bay Resort. On several occasions we walked back & forth to both parks, we likened it to the distance between World Showcase & Future World at EPCOT, except you needed to show your ticket for entrance. Both park layouts were similar enough to MK and HS in FL that we were comfortable with our whereabouts very soon into our 5day stay. We really enjoyed Disneyland Paris' old school ways. They don't use Magic Bands, they still have Fast Passes, there isn't even the index finger ticket technology. It was just a scan of your ticket & you are in, that was refreshing.  All in all, we had an enjoyable time as we were able to experience something new & interesting, had we not been vacationing in Paris already & struck a very affordable package(20% OFF Hotel & Park tickets   FREE Half Board Plus meal plan   FREE Hotel & Park tickets for kids under 7   50    voucher )we might have been more disappointed. We are glad we experienced Disneyland Paris, even with all the negatives, I would just not recommend coming from the US solely for a trip to Disneyland Paris, visit Paris, then if you have time & money visit DP for a day or so. Even though we did not see or do everything((normally we conquer all)we missed CaptainEO, Arcades, Riverboat, Keelboats, Legends of the Wild West)) we felt we didn   t really miss out on anything & that our 5days visiting both parks was more than enough time to visit DP.","Neutral"
"They didn't handle things professionally, it was overall a terrible experience to begin with. the lines took an hour and a half or more, keep in mind it wasn't even a busy day it was a Tuesday. People were very rude, they just didn't deserve the money they got from us and I will never be going back.","Negative"
"Was not what we expected but was still amazing time,some of the rides where closed but that didnt stop us from having fun, the food was over priced but the rides and the atmosphere was great, we went in low season so the rides where easily available","Positive"
"Lots of the park areas are boarded off, many of the cast members only speak French. If I was to sum it up service wise I'd say the American cast members believe in the magic, for the French ones it just seems like a job. It's not as busy as the American one but it just doesn't have the magical feeling.","Neutral"
"Well What a difference to the last time, First attraction broke down, then went to the making of movies set and the tractor or train broke down and yes you are right then the set broke down,Waste of moneyThe food is well over priced and it is dank.The whole place is DIRTY and in a very poor state of repair.POOR MANS FLORIDA, OH YES THE QUE IS JUST AS LONG AND THE TOILETS STINK","Negative"
"Well, well, well, I have visited this place once before and the magic didn't go away so that part was fine and dandy. However, this time around, we came for Electroland music festival and it was not quite there in many areas. Drink VIP was quite strange to say the least, we had to wait to buy 'coupons' then get a drink in the different line but that probably would help if they let us know clearly. No sign no explanation so everybody in the VIP bit was waiting for ages... they really messed that bar up big time and a while later, we wanted to drink water and it ran out so they gave us beer instead... well, I wasn't complaining but what about kids and mum? They couldn't have water and that's bad... the music was very EDM commercial which was okay, not great but it was being played quite quiet so that wasn't great either. We hope there will be the second time and they will improve on these areas. Kiss deserve to have fun.","Neutral"
"Having been to Disney World a few times, Disneyland Park being the original definitely has the more nostalgic feel! The smaller size park is nice with little ones because of all the standing around in line you do   it helps that the rides are so much closer together, less walking. I suggest getting there as early as possible. It   s cooler in the morning and that helps on the hot summer days. Also you can get on a bit more rides before the crowds start getting heavy. Download the Disney wait times app on your phone. If you're close enough to walk to the ride and look at the wait time, do that instead   only open the app to see rides that aren   t close enough to walk to. This will help the battery life on your phone especially if you   ve opted not the bring the DSLR and using the phone to take pictures. There is also an app for the map of the park, but don   t bother with it   the paper map you get at the entrance is much better.In the summer expect to wait in long lines for about every ride. While waiting in line for the Peter Pan ride, we were outside for at least a good 45 minutes and there were a few screaming toddlers in line, just miserably hot from being in the sun too long and not comforted by hats or sips of water. Disney could really put some kind of tent cover put up for the outside lines, especially for the little ones waiting out there so long. Make sure you see the shows too, look at the schedule when you get there. They are great shows and also a nice respite from the sun and being on your feet. If you go to the Frozen show, you need passes to come back so get them early. Despite the heat though, it   s manageable even for me who hates being out all day in it. You do get a breeze and the air is dry. Nothing compared to Disney World in summer, where it   s so much more hot & humid! Just make sure to have hats & sunscreen for the kids. The cast members for the most part are very friendly and helpful. Some of them weren   t though. I found them to be a lot more professional in Disney World. All in all, there is no place more magical than Disney. You become a kid again! We will be back!","Positive"
"There were lots of different activities suitable for my 35 month old. Lots of shows to see. However, we were disappointed that there weren't more characters around for the children to meet.","Neutral"
"We stayed for a few days on the way back from a trip to France. It was lots of fun and we had an excellent time but I think I would have been disappointed had I gone there as my only destination. The rides are pretty good but fairly dated and not nearly as diverse as the ones in Orlando. I have an eight year old who is a roller coaster fanatic but he did not find the coasters here as good as the ones at Alton Towers. The Qs were pretty long although FastPass helps but some of the rides were broken down. If you are planning a trip to Disney   save up and fly to Orlando if you can as the atmosphere, rides and customer service are all much better. Also if you like coffee   don't buy any here, it all comes powdered from a machine and is disgusting as well as expensive.","Neutral"
"Had a family day there for the first time and it was BEAUTIFUL! The Star Wars section was indeed my favorite. Rides were great and I dont even like roller coaters haha! The parade was beautiful aswell! We did go on the weekend so it was PACKED! Would of loved to ride more rides but it was indeed a great trip! ","Positive"

"It is the first theme park located inside the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and is owned and managed by the Hong Kong International Theme Parks. It is, together with Ocean Park Hong Kong, one of the two large theme parks in Hong Kong. Hong Kong Disneyland opened to visitors on Monday, 12 September 2005 at 13:00. Disney attempted to avoid problems of cultural backlash by attempting to incorporate Chinese culture, customs, and traditions when designing and building the resort, including adherence to the rules of feng shui. For instance, a bend was put in a walkway near the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort entrance so good qi energy wouldn't flow into the South China Sea","Positive"
"We visited them in early Jan, and on a weekday. Hence, there was practically no queues at the roller coaster rides. Even though the park was small, and there wasn't long queues, we still didn't manage to take all the rides. Perhaps we were walking too slowly. Since most visitors brought their small children, the kiddie rides such as the jungle cruise, flying dumbo, slinky the dog, and autopia had the longest queues (~15 minutes).","Positive"
"This is the perfect place for young ones and young at hearts to enjoy and just have fun. Just a walk and a picture here and there will make your visit memorable and meaningful. Went here with a toddler to breastfeed and I was so glad that they have a dedicated baby care area. Though long lines are everywhere, it is still worth to queue just to take the ride or have a photo. Photopass is included in our package but wasn   t able to maximize it because of the lines. The spookey parade(halloween time when we visited) was not suitable for toddlers. Perfect if you stay at disneyland hotel.","Positive"

"this is my 2nd time at disneyland hongkong. first of all, if u have been to disneyland orlando u will be severely disappointed since hongkong disneyland is very small. u can walk around it in just an hour. upon entering u will have the option of getting the star pass, if u don't mind paying an extra 100 hongkong dollars per person. ticket is 399 hk dollars for adults and 285 hk dollars for aged 3 to 11 years old. let me tell u about the good stuff first. view is very nice, the parade was fun to watch but it was a short one only around 5pm if i am not mistaken. now to the bad part... oh my! i am going to start my whining. terrible food! i bought an assortment of food like hotdogs, waffles, chicken wings and pizza. waffles was decent, the other selections was horrible. i was left hungry since it galls me to buy overpriced unsavory food. disneyland staff are ill mannered and rude, and to top it off they barely speak english argh! their guttural and incoherent sentences made me stop asking questions. to be fair to them, maybe they seem rude bec they barely speak english so they can't communicate properly but still... i expected better from disneyland staff. some of the staff kept on hurrying small kids that might make them have an accident like falling etc. which in my opinion is not right. queues are very long, u have to wait for an hour per ride and then it will only take 3 to 5 minutes for u to finish the ride :( my son still enjoyed his time in disneyland, he is 7 years old so no surprise there. my tip is this, eat first before u step on disneyland. terrible food!","Negative"
"This place was like mini Disney when compared to DisneyWorld in Florida. Cinderella's castle was about 1 3 the size. The entire park was about 1 4 the size. Less rides, etc. Good news was that the tickets were a lot less as well. I think they were $50 55 compared to $100 in the US. If you've never been to a Disney park, you'll like it. If you are from Florida (ahem) and have been to DisneyWorld, especially more than once, skip it because you'll be disappointed.","Neutral"
"It's Disneyland right so it should be fun! Well it's not that they don't know what their doing its just not quite happening here but things will change soon. For the high price of admission, the park isn't up to standards meaning it's small compared to the others. Combined with overcrowding, long lines for the kids rides and lack of shade in the sweltering heat here equals no fun and probably the main reason they are losing money. Charging the same entrance fee as other Disneylands double the size with twice as much to do also makes no sense. Looks like lots of construction is going on so hopefully in a few years I'll be back to see what has improved.","Neutral"
"We really did love it, but omg the humidity killed us and the kids! It's not their fault as we went in June (don't EVER do that!) so I can't blame anyone but ourselves for this one. The facilities are everything you expect. Hire some strollers as you come into the park   which is super easy to get there via the MKR (about 15 minutes by MKR from Centre of Hong Kong) even if your kids are 7 years old, you will be thankful to have somewhere for them to rest and something to hold all the stuff you will buy. Disney land is the only place even adults can run around with silly things on their heads etc and it's socially acceptable, so knock yourself out. Toilets are super clean   food is expensive as you would expect it to be, so don't complain about it and just enjoy the day for what it is, a life long dream come true.....We would do it again, but in a cooler time of year. Enjoy.","Positive"
"We've just stayed at Disney for the Disney Halloween party and have been left feeling sour. Although the park is beautifully decorated, has attractions for all ages, plenty of photo opportunities and atmospheric, paying additional to stay on the evening of Halloween is not worth it. Firstly staff were not equipped to deal with the crowds that they had and staff were both rude and uncooperative.You couldn't move for people. Queues were bordering 2 hours wait each so you couldn't really do much. Due to the amount of people you couldn't find seats anywhere. You couldn't even find somewhere safe to stand still because of the amount of people pushing you around. What you are paying additional for: a short Disney villains parade, a disco, a Halloween themed light show on the castle and having your photo taken with a Disney villain at the princess pavilions. During the day though security is tight. Airport scanners and bag scanners are mandatory. Prices as usual are high for everything, however you do find the occasional item on sale. Characters and their attendants are fantastic! If you don't book during the French half term you are fine. Half of our break was during their bank holidays, and the place was stacked with people. Now the French are back at work and school you can actually breathe. The park boasts some fantastic rides (Hollywood studio having the best ones) and some unique restaurants, but to fully enjoy the park you need lots of money and a bucket load of patience.","Neutral"
"... we probably just missed the big memory part a trip to Disneyland rovids to many others. So it was more or less a theme park of average quality, although very tidy with overpriced but good food. I was wondering whether you really have to charge an extra 15$ for parking if the entrance fee is 125$ per person. The riding attractions were good, but nobody had introduced to us the fastpass concept which we finally figured out by ourselves.","Neutral"
"NOT as good as we were expecting, way too busy, 2 hours wait for the good rides, no structure to where people walk and when you leave the park its a joke","Neutral"
"Make sure to plan a couple of days for each park. We only had two days and hardly got through Disneyland. Completely missed California Adventure (we managed to squeeze in two rides last minute, we couldn't miss the roller coaster!), may have been able to accomplish more but unknowingly booked our trip during the local  Spring Break . Do NOT go the last week of March, it will be PACKED! Make sure to get fast passes to all the most popular rides (max 2 at a time allowed). By the time you stand in line for one ride you'll be right on the money to make your fast pass slot.Bring a bag backpack along to make your life easier. Kids and family constantly needed me to hold purchased items, having a messenger bag with me made things that much less stressful.We had the Donald Dining plan, it came in handy as they allow you to use the vouchers just like cash. By the end of our stay we were getting food just to use up the remaining vouchers. It's a good way to be  worry free  financially as you can pay for your meals prior to your trip. Also, in regards to character dining, when you have the dining plan they give you a receipt of what your meal WOULD have cost without vouchers.. for 3 adults and 2 children to do a character breakfast it was almost $200!! And we did TWO of them.. it was a no brainer to us, the vouchers saved us big time (alcoholic beverages not included of course). The hotels are amazing! You can't go wrong with any of the options available. By the end of the second day our 8 year olds were worn out, whining about being tired, and we were frankly tired of hearing about it. That being said, there is a stroller rental just outside of the parks, it was well worth the price! The kids were laughing again and we were happy to finally get along at a quicker pace. A win win decision!","Positive"
"My husband and I loved DL! We had a 3 day park hopper ticket which allowed us early entry which we took advantage of. The park was always so clean   we enjoyed ourselves immensely","Positive"
"We traveled from the Magic Castle Hotel in Hollywood for a day in Disneyland at Anaheim. Myself, my 19yo and 16yo sons paid $142 each for transport to Anaheim and entry ($92 included). After we had waited 70 minutes for the first ride we were unimpressed, then 90 minutes for the second one was infuriating. Competing with a slowly moving mass of humanity to get from one attraction to the other was also daunting.There are so called 'quick passes' provided to avoid the queues, but you can only have one at a time   we managed to obtain one at 11am for a 6.30pm ride! So, they are an illusory concession to the queues. The outcome for us was cutting our losses, ' bailing out' at 1pm, and a $140 taxi ride back to LA   the only way to get back there before 9pm (public transport questions were responded to with wide eyed incredulity!)It seems to me that Disney have no compunction about cramming as many people as possible into the park, irrespective of the quality of the experience.Perhaps if you have younger children who are still entranced by the 'Disney Magic' it may be worth considering for the atmospherics. For teenagers   avoid it! It doesn't cater for them.","Negative"
"we went in the park over a few days and some of the big attractions were closed like pirates of the carribian and round the world in 80 days just to name all but a few. this really let the expereince down same again in here everything very expensive remember to go eaither full board or take your own food. they really do pull on the kids heart strings so be were its all about shopping the the main park really and nothing else ques int he main park between 1 to 2 hours and same again not even in season the best parts is the disney dreams at the park closeing time, the disney trains and the day parade","Neutral"
"I have been to Disneyland more times than I can count and it's just within the last year that I have grown to dislike Disneyland. Our last visit in late October did not help. It is so busy and crowded and most of the people that work there seem miserable! For the price we have to pay to get in there it just doesn't seem worth it anymore. ","Neutral"

"Bring comfortable shoes, you'll be doing a LOT of walking! Despite eating all the bad for you foods that people do on vacation, I came home weighing 5 pounds less! We went with our kids, and while the 15 month old will have no memories of it, I'm sure, our nearly 5 year old had himself such a blast. Food is available all over, and while I expected ridiculous prices for it, it wasn't astronomical, and was quite delicious. Souvenirs are pricey though, particularly clothing (t shirts fleeces hats), but mouse ears are a must have. You can find some souvenir shops outside of the park to purchase take home items at much less of the cost, if your souvenir budget is small. There are some long lines, as most people will have heard about by now, and you can get what is called a  Fast Track pass  that gets you first admission. Then after all passholders are in a ride attraction show, they let the general stand by people in. We didn't buy any fast track passes, but the lines weren't too awful in the general stand by lanes (except for the Finding Nemo ride, an hour long!) Overall, we had a great time, and would do it again if we can.","Positive"
"Always fun but so crowded you can hardly move. Only got to go on 2 rides because of the long lines. Not really thaat fun in the heat and with the crowds.","Neutral"
"we like everything but the lines we thought it was their off season but the lines where still long and we were disappointed with the breakfast the last time they did a little show during the breakfast this time they didn't. Then when we were in the park we did not see any of the princess.","Positive"
"Had to queue for everything! And if you don't stay in one of the disney hotels and make use of your 'extra magic hours' in the morning then you don't stand a chance for getting things like photos with Mickey and Minnie together, Donald Duck or get one of the 'all exclusive' queue for hours golden ticket to see a random disney princess   or should i say get allocated a time slot to then queue again to see a random disney princess! Don't expect to get anywhere near a frozen character though because these are gold dust that Disney are milking every penny for!Characters don't walk around the park   they stand somewhere for you to queue to meet them. Oh and when there time is up they just walk away even if they are in the middle of photos with you or signing autograph books! Our children were devastated to have characters walk off before signing their autograph books   HOW RUDE!Several broken down rides and works being carried out on the park that weren't told about until after booking.","Negative"
"We came to Disney Land with high hopes and excitement after been to the one in Japan 4 months ago. However from the minute we first entered the gates we were already let down by the attention of detail compared to Japan! However we continued on with a open mind. A positive were the lines were definitely shorter than Japans as there is alot less people visiting the park. Once we had been on a couple of rides we noticed a huge difference between the parks! its actually disappointing to see that there is a massive difference, wether this is due to the park being older im assuming. The Park is well over due for a major refurb. The food definitely needs attention to as there is limited food options that are at the reasonable price. 60 euros for a steak is beyond a joke! This park is missing the Disney feel we got from Japans park. I think management needs to go check out the difference of quality between these two as we were not the only ones to say this. Two other couples we spoke to said the same thing but with Florida and California being better. Ino people made read this and think this is harsh however its reality. If this is your first disney experience you can only go upwards from here.Likes:All roller coaster ridesoption of two parkschuros stand at the entrance before entering the parkDislikes:Smoking throughout the park especially in lines, when there is dedicated smoking areas. (know one polices this!)Poor food! (Steer clear of there hot dogs) if you want a decent meal you will pay 60 euros for a steak!Fast pass booths close early.Park opening at 10am for people who are not staying in the resort. While resort guests were able to enter at 8:30am! Male staff entering female toilets to clean while females are present making them feel very un easy! More then one lady complained out loud about this! This would have to be the biggest concern we seen!","Negative"
"My 3 1 2 year old and my husband loved it. It was truly magical.","Positive"
"On our recent trip to California, we had one day to spend at Disneyland. Before our trip, I saw that Disney California Adventure was hosting Grad Night. I had no idea that would impact our day as badly as it did. By 2:00 on the day of our park visit, the crowd was unbearable. There was so much that we didn't see at all. When you see a special event advertised at either park, be aware that it will definitely drive up the crowds at both parks. The attractions that we saw were fun. We had a wonderful breakfast with Minnie and friends. The Iron Man 3 exhibit in Innoventions was the favorite of both my kids.","Neutral"
"Disneyland Paris is ideal for a long weekend or midweek stay with young kids. The park is magical and all done very well only real let down is the rude and arrogant staff. Clearly unhappy to be there, even the lady on guest relations was rude so think that sums it up. Ignoring the staff the attractions and park itself are very good. Queues vary depending on the time of year you go, however in November when we went they weren't a problem. Queuing to meet characters or buy merchandise was however a problem mostly due to French and Spanish guests who seem to have no issue with personal space for one and no issue with pushing in front of you. You will have a wonderful time once you get past these minor issues.","Positive"
"So much of the park is closed!! Very disappointing   only a few rides In the park. I do know there is an expansion planned, but so much was closed now, I don't know how they can afford to expand! I knew it was a small park before we went, but it is lacking the 'Disney' in every aspect... other than the cost! It is really easy to get to on the MTR and good for about 3hrs of entertainment If you are looking for something different to do while visiting HK.","Negative"
"It's a smaller park than Florida and it's not really as Christmassy as you would think. Was really busy but died down after 4 and the wait times were only like 10 30mins instead of 60 mins. The lines a fluent . Would recommend single rider if that's possible with your group. You can fast pass but they are only available at certain times. You can get more than one at a time aswell but I think you have to wait an hour or so. The fireworks were okay but nothing compared to Florida. The light parade was amazing! A must see! Was quaint but busy park. Downtown Disney wasn't much to see, city walk was better. Has the lego shop and a big Disney store and lots of food places. If theres a choice between Florida or California,definitely Florida.","Neutral"
"We were there with our family 10 13 16. It was near impossible to get on any rides and we feel like we wasted money just to walk around the park, eat horrible food and bump into other frustrated people. I know the park is for kids and sometimes you just have to deal with crowds to make them happy, but this trip was ridiculous. If they are going to sell that many tickets to get into the park they should have a way for people to track it and decide if they want to try another day.Another disappointing thing was the characters that used to be found walking around the park were nowhere to be found. This was very disappointing. We waited in lines to get pictures with the characters only to get to the front of the line in time for breaks. This added to the frustration of an already frustrating day. The lady asking for feedback in the park was given. This same information. Hopefully they can come up with some way to truly make this the happiest place on earth, because it wasn't for us.","Negative"
"Crowded. Lines on top of lines. We went on a Monday in the pouring rain, not a holiday, after spring break season ended. It was about 50 degrees. Within 5 minutes of the park opening Peter Pan had a 70 minute wait. Of course, an average Disney park is still a Disney Park, so don't avoid it because of lines. Just know that Disneyland desperately needs to extend its operating hours to accommodate the crowds. This park could easily be open 7am     1am every day and still feel crowded.","Neutral"
"Went to Disney for a couple of days in order to break the drive down to Chamonix for a weeks skiing at Easter. Been to Disneyland in California at Easter before and to Disneyworld in Florida 4 times in the last 5 years. The French version seems to lack atmosphere, had far fewer staff, poor sign posting, French people who didn't seems to feel that they had to wait in line like everyone else for a ride and infact 2 of the rides broke down whilst we were in the queue. We made the best of the place but I'd rather save my money and go to USA instead given that several of the main rides were also closed. Love Disney but felt very disappointed by this experience.","Neutral"

"A large proportion of the Disneyland Park is currently being rebuilt   so when we visited in first week of April there was not a single attraction open in Frontier Land and four other major attractions were closed in the rest of the park (Peter Pan, Robinson Crusoe Tree, Adventure Isle, Star Tours)   playgrounds, 2 of the train stations & Roller Coaster in Disney Studios. This, of course, put even more pressure on the rides that were open and the wait times during the school holidays are horrendous ... even with fast pass expect to wait up to half hour on popular rides ...","Negative"

"Fulfilled parental obligations by engaging in two days of 'busy ness'. The crowds aren't our scenes, and as our children aren't fans of thrilling rides, the crowds simply became overbearing.

One women tried to up sell my daughter when she wanted a brioche and a drink for the offer price of 5.59   , she tried telling her she couldn't do it and she had to buy the expensive cup! We haven't been for ten years and it still felt like 'same old' no wow factor for us anymore even after so long. I think the quality of the food is disappointing. The French in my opinion just 'can't do Disney' Attitudes are poor, unenthusiastic, miserable! This is definitely our last time here, wouldn't waste our money. That said, for a 'first time experience'. It will still be ok. As long as you haven't experienced Florida, the true home of Disney! In my opinion.... Save up and go there!","Neutral"

"We are from the Midwest so a trip to Disneyland was a much anticipated event. We have been to Disney World many times but this was our first visit as a family to Disneyland. We went to the park at opening which allowed us to be one of the first riders on several of the rides. My husband had the foresight to buy the max pass. Which made our wait times much less for the popular rides. We had pre planned our lunch at Cafe Orleans. Our lunch was superb! The Monte Cristo was the best I had ever eaten. The service was very good and even though we were sitting outside we felt it was shaded and restful. We made sure to stop by the Tiki Room and grabbed a Dole Whip Float to enjoy during the show. Both are always a family favorite. The weather was perfect unlike the heat of Orlando, which made our day very comfortable. The highlight of our day was definately seeing our son meet and have his picture taken with Chewbacca at the Star Port in Tomorrowland. We all decided that Disneyland was a definite do again on our bucket list of family fun!","Positive"

"0. Just FYI: Disney park is the one with attractions that are  cute  and more for young kids (so probably exactly what you picture as disney park) while the walt disney studios are more  hardcore  rollercoasters. Disney is big enough for one day visit, so if you want to visit two parks, I would recommend two days (however, if you are not a big fan of amusement parks, maybe just pick one instead).1. Car parking costs about 20 Euros, and to get to the parking, there will be traffic jam. I was at Disney during March, when there is less people, and still we stand in trafic to get to parking for about 15 min or more.2. From parking to park it's a quite long walk, so prepare for that.3. To get to park there will be queue (again!). We were standing at least 40 min (again, this wasn't during the high season!).4. Yes, once you are inside, for most of the attractions there is queue as well. It varies from 30 to 90 min depending on the attraction. The aplication with waiting times is useful   the waiting tickets. However, closer to the evening (about 20h) many places are less crowded.5. It is better to target restaurants somewhere further as to the ones closer to popular attractions, you guessed it, there is queue ;) The food, in comparison to everything else, it not that super overpriced   you can buy a hamburger and salad for 10 euro which is a not so terrible price.6. Everything is super overpriced. Like, really, really overpriced. Most of cheaper toys are super low quality, and everything that is about decent quality usually starts from 25 euros. There are really a lot of junk sold for amazingly high prices, so if you are with a kid, prepare for that. And there are a lot of shops everywhere. 7. As for standing in queues, most of places have some rooftop in case of rain, however, if the queue is long, usualy there is not enough of roof for everybody. Also, most places are only heated inside, so you can get super cold while standing outside.All in all, I am not big fan of the amusement parks, and I find my one trip to disney enough for (probably) a life time, or at least looong time. It is nicely done and cute, however the overall prices and queues do not make me want to come back.","Neutral"
"I have been going to Disneyland since I was a kid 50 years ago, so I've seen a few changes. I now live out of state but still visit the park 1 2 times a year, but this year, because of the crazy crowds, ride closures, costs corporate greed, I we've decided to move on. We figured the day after MLK would be ok,...um, no. 3 long lines before we even get into the park! Main Street and the front of the castle have ugly plywood, Mansion and Splah Mntn closed...no reduction in price, but increase in crowds. Perhaps a cap on local passes? The smaller size of Disneyland (compared to World) can't handle the crowds at all. its obvious that the Disney  corporates  haven't experienced  The Happiest Place  like the rest of us.","Negative"
"Where do I begin? On ariving to the park there wasn't alot of explaining where to go or what to do. II would say that there wasn't very much advertising for the events that were happening in the park. I think also that the fireworks are far to late. We had a two hour drive home so to have to wait around until 22.00 to see the fireworks then was too late. Also alot of the rides shut at 17.00 so you have along period to wait with nothing to do.I was also very dissapointed that the characters weren't around to have photos with. That is all part of the experience and they weren't there : (Although there were a few things that were dissapointing we still had a good day. Merry Christmas all  ","Neutral"
"If you have ever been to Tokyo Disneyland, you will definitely feel very disappointed while visiting Hong Kong Disneyland!Food atmosphere souvenir are no good and no surprising.

"My wife and I only have one day at each park. So I booked us this tour for the morning of our Disneyland Park day.We did not have a magical time. We had a pretty slow group and we only got to go on 3 rides during our tour. The tour went from 9:45 (people showed up late and we we told to be there at 9:15) until after 2pm. Over four hours and only three rides.I knew most of the history already so the tour itself wasn't that great for me. When this would be worth it:*If you have at LEAST 3 days in the parks OR come here regularly throughout the year.*If you come regularly and want a SE Disney Pin*If you want a relaxing day and don't care about rides or waiting for things.*You REALLY want to see inside the dream suiteWhen this is not worth it:*If you only have one day per park. We missed out on a bunch of rides because the length of the tour.*If you LOVE rides and don't really care that much about history*If you have kids. Kids we were with HATED is and were so bored.We did not even go near Club 33 and didn't see Walt's apt or ride in the train.Long Story Short...I liked the tour in general (because I LOVE all things Disney) but it wasted a lot of our day and we missed a bunch of rides because of it...oh, and we went in early Nov when the crowds are much lighter...","Negative"
"Disneyland Paris is nothing like the American parks. The staff are less friendly, there are queues stretching out of fast food restaurants and there are far fewer activities than the Anaheim or Orlando parks.The parks close quite early in October (8pm). Smoking is permitted all over the park and the restrooms are not always at their cleanest.","Neutral"
"We got to the park at 8:00. It was quiet & cool. 1 hour later it was packed & hot! We still had a great time (how could you not???) but if there is a next time, we'll go in the late fall to avoid the heat & crowds.","Positive"
"I've been to Disneyland many times since it's only 90 miles from San Diego where I lived. I've been to Disney world in Orlando too and much prefer Disneyland. It's not nearly as hot and muggy and the attractions are closer together so you can see more in less time. At christmas, Downtown Disney decorates and at the end of the night,  snow  falls in the town square and puts you in the Christmas spirit.I took my kids when they got old enough to enjoy it and they were both taken by all the attractions. Especially my daughter who thought she was in heaven with all the real life princesses walking around.I would recommend the fast pass to plan your day and shorten line time waits and if you stay overnight, choose a hotel a few miles away if you want to save money.","Positive"
"It's the smallest of the Disney parks so if you've been to the others it's a little disappointing. I have a 13 year old daughter and there wasn't enough for her age level. Sadly Space Mountain was closed due to renovations. The Hollywood Hotel was lovely. Everything you expect from Disney. If you have never been to a Disney park it's a good introduction. It's also better for young kids. ","Positive"
"We really enjoyed the park, went there with our 19 month old daughter, she loved it, we went to the park early in the morning on Friday not too busy, went to toon town took character photos and then went for the rides, stayed until 2, it was great not too busy, after resting a bit went back again at night and it was too busy long lines for the rides and overall too much for a toddler so had to leave. Bottom line make sure to be there before opening and enjoy the park while not too busy. We ate at carnation restaurant and it was great.","Positive"
"We booked DLP for a short trip for our son's 11th birthday and took advantage of Kids under 12 stay and play for free. We have done DLP in 2000 with our oldest, so that park had obviously increased in size. The park offered what we expected but we did not get the  Disney Magic  we get when we go to Walt Disney World in Florida. The food was OK but was expensive. The merchandise was also very expensive. As we had booked a Disney Hotel we took advantage of the extra magic hours. It seems they have half the park closed and only open some rides to half capacity so your extra magic hours are spent in line for about and hour at a time waitiing to get on the rides. I suppose the holiday was OK but next time we will certainly be keeping our money for Florida where you get mcuh more for your money.","Neutral"
"We are passholders and love Disneyland we go 2 to 3 times a year but the the crowds seem to get bigger everytime and the staff far less sincere and flat out rude! This is the second straight visit cast members have talked about some highly inappropriate things right in front of our kids and tons of other kids while we wait for fireworks. The guests making out in line you cannot do much about but the staff working should be a little more aware of the little kids around them. I've also noticed that a lot of the little details that Disney has always been so famous for seem to be neglected..paint, tattered flags, dirty tables, bathrooms etc. We rarely go in the summer so we always expect some sort of work to be done but lately a lot of things seem to be forgotten about. We will always love Disney and continue to visit but we may let our passes go.","Neutral"
"Oh Dear , from my visit to Euro Disney in 2010 to June 2012 what a deline in standards and attractions at Euro Disney.Hardly any characters about , rides closed or breaking down in mid flight and very very dirty .

"My family and I were so excited to revisit Disneyland. I have always felt it was more quaint, magical and less commercialized than Disney world. However, on this trip, the staff seemedGrumpy and frankly over it. The ticket window lady was super annoyed with our transaction. Several rides were down for refurbishment, which we knew ahead of time. Fast passes are lacking and the wait times begin to become too long. We love Disneyland but felt the original idea and concept is becoming lost.","Neutral"

"Great atmosphere, bueatiful set up and surroundings and staff helpful & happy. If you have children ages 5 to 12 its a must visit. Not many thrill seeker rides for the seasoned theme park veteran though you will find the lines shortest on the most fun of rides (my daughter and i loved the runaway mine cars the most). Even on a weekday average lines are over 30 minutes though setting is nice and time waiting passes quickly. Getting to and from the park is quick & easy. A few rides seem very short in ride time for the length of the wait getting on. I also think the characters could come out to see the kids more, we managed 1 photo session in our 7 our visit and saw only 2 others with the lines already closed.","Positive"
"What can I say ... we all know it's Disney, there was queues for everything. The place it's very clean and tidy and the staff polite, from security, to ticket sales and rides staff.The rides are feeling a bit aged ... but it's fun if you like to queue for 50 mins for 5 mins fun.The worst thing ..... everything it's stupidly expensive. They have a monopoly, but why rip off people and families who want to have a fun day. Bag of crisps 5 euro, burger meals for 2 adults, two tots over 50 euros !!!!!!Have fun ... but hey it won't be cheap.","Neutral"

Day 1 of our 3 day park hopper tickets, due to long wait lines we only rode 3 ride ALL DAY! We had special event tickets for Trick or Treat with Mickey for a different day. While the actual trick or treat was done quite well, we took advantage of the lack of lines for the rides and managed to get on some with very little wait then.This is not the Disneyland of the past. We will not be back.","Neutral"
"What a bad disney experience it was everything from rude cast members to broken rides to guests smoking everywhere in the park, even in rides! Cutting lines and CM smiling and not doing anything about it!What a beautiful disney design gone into decay lack of maintenance funding perhaps? Never saw cast members walking around the park with windex bottles or reception at rainforest cafe being rude and refusing to give seats because section is closed and 2 mins later put next customers there while looking at us with an angry face. Is this what Walt Disney created or a sad broken version, the latter I think. M. Iger should go visit Paris and compare with his florida parks. It shows that Disney only owns 40% of the Park vs 100% in Florida. A disney park without Disney Magic should't be called Disneyland.","Negative"
"This park is certainly not up to the standards of the Disney resorts I visited in Florida and California (FL as a Child, CA as a child and adult). Disney is a company that prides itself on excellent service, and you don't find it here. Yes, I realize it is Disney, yes, I realize it is Paris, so yes I realize it's going to be expensive. However, what goes on here is over the top, bordering on extortion. Hot water and a Tea Bag (not a good brand, either), well over 3 EUR, Bottle of Diet Coke for 4, Beer for 7? Not to mention the food options and quality are just not there. At other Disney locations you can get a wide array of culinary options, the food choices were limited here and they were expensive. Toilets were not clearly marked. Yes, they give you a map, but when you've got a 5 year old and 2.5 year old who need to go immediately, it's not always conducive to check the map. The restrooms were unsanitary in many cases and baby changing facilities were poor non existent, which I found odd for a park that caters to children. I only found changing facilities in a few men's rooms and it was a cold metal slab, luckily we had a blanket. Smoking is not limited to designated areas like it is at theme parks in the UK and US: Smokers can light up anywhere and they are rather rude about doing so. Even areas where smoking was not supposed to be allowed, such as in queues for rides or shows, the staff did not enforce the smoking ban. All in all, this Disney park has a long way to go before it is worthy of the name Disney.","Negative"
"I was absolutely appalled with how poorly this place is managed! They oversell their tickets resulting in the park being so beyond overcrowded to the point of it being a health and safety risk of suffocating! The density of the crowds was a particular nightmare for me as I am a highly sensitive person who gets really panic stricken being in crowds usually, but this was on a whole new level from the usual crowds I've had to suffer with before! They clearily oversell their tickets instead of setting a limit to the amount of people that enter the park and controlling it, as like I mention crowds are beyond abysmal and you wait in queues for rides for 1 hour and a half, so long that by the time you're done there you've only gotten round 2 or 3 rides. Not only that but literally whenever we went to one of the restaurants there to eat there were endless queues which were moving verly slowly, which was also the same for whenever you wanted to get a drink from a cart truck or something, which is so impractical and wrong when it's something essential like food and drink that you need. I mean yes it was peak season being the end of August but I still think there should of been some control over the crowds queues to make things more accessible, like not overselling their tickets.Something that really infuriated and disgusted me was when we were in the studio park and there was a sudden rainstorm, we were queuing outside the theatre place to see a show there where there was such a dense crowd to say the least, mostly due to the fact it was raining and people were trying to shelter, that there was an actual risk of suffocating as there was not control or structure of this crowd. I was infuriated and disgusted by the fact that there were no staff controlling this crowd, to say for instance that there were too many people and this crowd was all too unstructured and out of control and getting rid of lots of the people nearer the back, but instead they made the crowd worse by asking people who were just sitting down out of the queue to shelter from the rain to get up and join the queue, not the back of it but beside the people who were already at the front, despite the fact they were outside the barrier and people outside the barrier are not allowed to join the queue, so they were basically breaking their own rules! It was disgusting, they didn't do anything to control the extremely dense crowd, instead making it worse, and just stood there apathetically, letting the crowd go denser and denser making people wait for ages. We left the crowd eventually ofcourse.Just overall appalling.","Negative"
"To say disneyland is for kids is nothing short of a wrong statement. It is a place where young or old , you cherish your childhood, love to go back into the world of make believe and enjoy unspoilt, uncomplicated fun.The disney parade and fireworks are outstanding. The evening parade is more better. It is difficult to complete in 1 day however, selecting the attractions does no harm. The themed attractions and rides are worth. The place is also friendly to wheel chair and senior citizens and the washrooms, drinking water is well spaced and plenty of places to rest. The best part was to see my 75 year old have the joy of a child in his eyes. Maybe that is where the success of Disneyland lies.The main street reminds of the old world West Charm. A day well spent","Positive"
"I am a Disneyland lover but the tickets for the park were sold via the hotel we stayed at and at no time from the sale to getting into the gate at the park were we informed that most of rides in a third of the park areas, food carts and stall close at 6pm. The park is advertised as open til 9pm.In addition the parade takes place in total darkness and you can't move around freely for fear of falling in the dark or being robbed. This is a danger for both older and younger people.We did approach the Disneyland staff to complain about the price of the tickets   given they were charged at a full rate  with no after 5pm rate applicable and only portion of the park available to access. So I am not sure I would say rush off to this park if you are in Hing Kong. It's expensive and not nearly as fun as Disneyland Los Angles   Anaheim park.","Neutral"
"To reach the place by MTR, drop on Sunny Bay which is just one stop before Tung Chung station.From there you need to look for Disneyland train. Expect to spend a whole day here. Lots of walking, and will be hard due to humid and hot weather on the area. Make sure you bring umbrella and drink plenty of water, the drink here are expensive.First thing to do is to go to Tomorrowland and try Space Mountain   mini roller coaster. Skip the rest of Tomorrowland and go straight to Toy Story land and ride the RC racer. And then the last one is Adventureland with the Jungle River Cruise. That is folks...","Negative"
"On arriving at the park after travelling overnight by coach and ferry had to queue over half an hour for toilets as only four available outside the park. Spent most of our day queuing for rides which broke down before we got on them and when I complained they just shrugged their shoulders. There were no Disney characters wandering about, you had to queue to see them. The parade was the best part of the day but only lasted 20 minutes. There was no character to the park, you could of been any where. You are better off going to one of the theme parks in England. Toilet facilities were smelly and food vastly overpriced. The kids were very disappointed as they have been wanting to go for years. It was also very tired looking and shabby, shops all sold the same thing and were very expensive. Never again!!","Negative"
"A total waste of money not enough rides for the amount of people visiting that goe`s for kids & adult rides the wait to get on a ride was well over an hour, to many merchandise outlets & restaurants,no disney characters walking round there were two main points that pleased the kids Elsa & friend drove round in a carriage & then the grand parade both had more security than Barack Obama!!!","Negative"
"Just back. An HOUR AND A HALF queue just to get in the Park. Queues to rides ranged between two hours and at least 45 minutes. We queued for 45 minutes to hire a stroller. We walked for ages to get to the ice cream parlour and it was SHUT. We went to another ice cream kiosk and queued for an hour to get an ice cream   only to be told that the flavours we wanted were sold out. Four major rides NOT working. Apart from parades, hardly any characters just walking around the Park. Prices exorbitant. . It cost 74 euro,   57 to get in the Park and because of all the queuing we only ended up with SIX rides all day   this works out at nearly   10 per ride. No Fast Passes were working. Disneyland was obviously built to accommodate only half of the visitors that were there. We were told by our shuttle driver,  You should see it in the summer, just awful   so overcrowded ! Not the happy, carefree place shown in the adverts. Very disappointed. Looks like Disneyland will be a victim of its own success. We have been to Florida Disneyland twice and this was our third visit to Disneyland Paris. Possibly our last (?!)","Negative"
"Visited Disneyland Hong Kong today March 15, 2019. Poor experience. Very little there in the first place in terms of rides and other experiences. But most of it was closed for renovations (including the main Disney castle) or lots of stuff just not open anyway. Kids couldn't get pics with their fav characters as they kept disappearing for a break every 20 mins and queues were long already. All this missing and not even a reduction in the already expensive price. Pretty crappy day outSmall park, half open. Not worth the money.","Negative"
"However I am not a Disney fans but I need to say that this place is full of excitement for me!! I enjoy the name of machine is Space Mountain(I am not sure). It's a indoor roller coaster which you need to wear a ''image'' glasses and played. In the evening they have fantasy firework and parade!! I've really enjoyed my vacation in Hong Kong Disneyland.","Positive"
"We couldn't have loved our Disney experience more! The cast members, the shows, the rides, the decorations, the cleanliness, the feeling of safety for my whole family, the fun, the attractions, everything was wonderful, but more healthy food options for meals would be wonderful, although it wasn't awful, it was fine. We really did love every part of our experience!","Positive"
"We are visiting Paris from the US. We decided to take our 4 and 6 year old to Disneyland Paris for the day. Short feedback: This was the WORST experience we have ever had bar none at a park and it was 10X the price of some of the regional parks we visit all the time in the DC area. For starters there are really on 7 8 rides in the WHOLE place. The rides are super short   the merry go round went for 2 minutes!!!!!!!! We timed it. Took 1 hour to get on, 5 minutes for them to load us and in 2 minutes we were off! Second everything has a LONG line ... at least 90 minutes. The rides also suck! They are not that interesting... On top of all this the staff is rude and the place is dirty!Honestly this was a complete waste of time and money. Will never go again .. much better to go to the children's museum in Paris or go cart riding or sticking a fork in your eye!","Negative"
"Went to Cars first week it opened.  Lines were 4 hrs long, but it was great and Disney spared no expense.  We spent 12 hrs at the Park, hopping between parks, and loved every minute of it.","Positive"
"I visited disney on 24 July 2012 as a birthday treat for my 3 year old.The day started ok, and after a lengthy queue she was able to have some 1:1 time with Mickey, following which she was really keen to see some more of her Disney 'friends'. She was placated by the discussion that she would see them all at the parade later. The day progressed relatively successfully, if in a somewhat wallet draining manner (   10 for 3 bottles of drink, the same for 3 ice creams, and    33 for lunch for 3... On a hot day, that's    70 in food and drinks alone)At 630, we went to find a space for the parade which was to start at 7... So my daughter would have a good view of the parade... We barely managed to get a space as it was already heavy populated even at that time..Nearing 7, it was heavily overcast, but we all waited on for the parade... It did not, at any point rain...At 7pm exactly, when the parade was due to start, and expectation was built in the crowd, an announcement was made that said the parade was cancelled due to inclement weather.. I thought it was a joke t first, until the crowd started jeering and then started getting up and walking off...Surely enough.. It was all cancelled.. The staff started collecting the barriers etc and that was that.. At no point did it rain, and by 720 the cloud had largely broken up and I have a photo of the blue sky that was showing by this point.This was massively upsetting for my daughter and was to my mind an appalling piece of event management and a massive misjudgement given that it didn't rain and was blown over 15 minutes later! Somebody should be fired as a result of it and I'm sure my complaint will be lost in a sea of others as MANY people were equally disappointed by this ridiculous management call, which is made much worse by the fact that they did not notify the gathered crowd, many whom had been waiting 30 60 minutes, until the event was actually due to start... The weather was no better worse at 7pm than it was at 645, and the fact that they had waited until 7 to cancel it added insult to injury. If this is an typical example of Disney parks, it may well be the last one I ever take my family too!","Negative"
"Bought entry and parking online before we went. Thought & read it is easier & cheaper  WRONG! Could it find the parking, many others had to take a U turn to find it too. Not labeled well at all! Finally found something and parked. Disneyland was great, 1st time for the kids, came out to pay for parking & we were in the wrong lot for the pass we had, had to pay again! Ugh! They need much better signage for just getting there once on Disney property!","Negative"
"The trip was great after we left this hotel the carpet and furniture was filthy. The drapes and walls were filthy as well. Once we checked into the Double Tree things began to look up. The Hotel was booked by Travel Agent we voiced all concerns to the agent and advised he should remove the Hotel from his list, asked if he had indeed stayed there before and the answer was no. He thanked us for letting him know. Disney was Great. The hotel was horrific.","Positive"
"My friend and I (we are both in our mid to late 20s) have visited Disneyland Paris three times in the past 3 years.. The magic of this place is still going strong! I love the way it's laid out and decorated   it's so lovely to glance around and see that everyone's smiling and having an amazing time! There are loads of rides to suit everyone.. I'm obsessed with them all! Only negative that we noted is that the 'it's a small world' ride would really benefit from having some work done on it's ceiling to mask the standard grey roof panelling   it really shatters the illusion & the magic when you look up and you are instantly brought back to earth with a bang when you're reminded that you're just floating around a huge warehouse filled with dolls.. Then it starts to take on a creepy feel! Other than that, I didn't feel the rides required updating & reallyenjoyed everything!Food in the park is wildly expensive & avoid the weekends as the queues are a killer! We just returned from our trip there (Tuesday & Wednesday) and the longest we had to queue was probably 20 minutes   that's absolutely nothing!!! Tip: bring good shoes   you'll do a LOT of walking! And I mean a lot... Potentially 8hrs  each day. Rest regularly. You don't want to be crippled with sore feet by the end of the first day.. & you will unless you take good footwear. Such a boring point to end on haha but honestly, it could ruin your experience otherwise!Overall   Disneyland Paris is still mighty magical & i'd definitely go a fourth time!","Positive"
"Queues too long 100 minutes! Unfriendly staff who do not smile and welcome you. Some restaurants and attractions that close down too early, 17h00 when the park is still open until 11.00pm leaving less choice and greater crowding in concentrated areas. Burgers and nuggets sold nearly everywhere now   hardly any variety in the different themed take aways unless you want to spend a fortune in the extortionately priced restaurants. The same goes for the shops   the same items for sale in almost all of the shops. The excellent tea with the Disney characters has now been eliminated. Halloween is only on one night now and you have to pay for certain things within the park such as face painting and the shooting range when you have already paid rising entry fees to get in in the first place. Sooo disappointed at this business mentality, which is killing the spirit of what Disney is all about. Walt would be turning in his ice pack!","Negative"
"We visited this park in july and it was far too overcrowded. You just could not walk anywere at any kind of pace because there was far too many prams and buggies. I know Disney is for children but why take babies aged from 6months to 12 months into a park and the tempratures were burning hot. These children are far too young to know what is going on.We left after 2 hours as the crowds and traffic jams with prams and buggies became ridiculous","Neutral"
"Booked a trip to Disney for a week for my 4 year old daughters b day. We have 3 other children. Bought 3 day hopper online only to spend an hour at the ticket booth since staff could not find the tickets in    the system    conformation email apparently was not sufficient. Upon standing in line dealing with a cantankerous female booth worker we were told sorry can   t find them..... So, a not so quick phone call for refund followed and we paid a premium at the booth for same tickets. Finally got in mid day whooo hooo. Met with crowds long waits, over priced food and more unfriendly staff. Mind you this was the off season too. Ordered some food screwed it up, oh well ate it anyway. Several rides closed and Arielle   s Grotto closed. Daughter wanted a meal with the princesses as far as I could research there are no other establishments that offer this. Disney without princesses nice. Furthermore, parking. We made mistake of parking in the shopping area, downtown Disney. For a mere 48$ a day you can park here. We found out later after asking multiple people that you can validate it by spending money in the shopping district. Of course after we   d paid 48$ twice for two days. Booth employee said bring receipt, so ate a 130$ meal for six, brought receipt only to be told nope stamp on ticket only. Asked for a supervisor to plead our case. Brian, the apparent supervisor came told us what you can   t read the sign it   s been there all day since 7:30. The one that says validate you see, wow. Hmmm we are morons perhaps but explained what we   d been told, he said you can   t read? Wow ultimately paid 96$ in one day to park since we left for naps and came back. Ticket from earlier didn   t matter either. It   s down right criminal. Happiest place on earth Nope just look at all the other over paying suckers and ask yourself is it? Problem is putting a price on a child   s happiness a parents weakness of which Disney is the authority of exploitation. This was not our first trip been to Aulani and Disneyworld as well the service here in Anaheim fell far far short it   s become an unfriendly corporate corrupt world with disgruntled unfriendly employees.","Negative"
"Visited here not so long after it opened, in my late teens. Have since been to the Florida parks a couple of times, and now, looking at Paris, it needs an injection of staff training, repair and something new to bring into 2014 onwards. I was there in June of this year, just as the summer season was starting. The staff could do with some training from their American counterparts on acting their roles. After all, they have to audition to get them in the first place. The various cafes I experienced seem inadequately staffed. Considering they had had all of the quieter winter and spring months to get their maintenance up to scratch, there were too many instances of peeling, or missing paint, cracked pavements and broken railings. The place seemed dirty, tired and had a huge lack of atmosphere. I love Disney, I love their theme parks, and I'd definitely go back to Florida, but I'll give Paris a swerve unless I hear things have improved.","Neutral"

"I loved it as I loved to see Disneyland : ) I did not do much of the rides as I hate to wait in line and do not like the roller coasters : ) But it is worth a visit for sure! Avoid the holidays of course! Get a fast pass!","Positive"
"As per what the title states.. Compared to the other Disney parks (I have been to the Cali and Florida ones numerous times), this Hong Kong location is very small.It does have some good rides.. both classic and new different ones. But my experience was completely ruined by the mass amounts of mainland china tourists who are not only rude, poor mannered but are constantly finding ways to cut the queue. It has been a nuisance being around them all day to the point where my family and I decided to leave early. Disney should really step up their staff and security in ensuring ALL guests have a good experience. I have visited once a few years back, once again this year.. But based on my my most recent experience.. It's better off saving your money and go to any of the other disneys instead.","Neutral"
"We love Disney. And have visited so many times that I cannot keep track of how many times we have visited. But this was probably the most disappointing trip. The park was fairly full with long lines. The parades and the way the employees handled the roping off was beyond annoying. At times we felt trapped in certain locations. The cast members waving orange sticks were so annoying and confusing. I get it, some people like the parades, but many do not. There has got to be a better way or perhaps Disneyland is too small to handle a parade. There was just no where to walk. And after paying $600 for the four of us to get in, we felt very ripped off that we couldn't get to where we needed to easily and quickly. At one point a lady on one of those carts started screaming. Literally screaming.The Disney Card meet and greet was a joke. 30  minute wait for one character which was Minnie Mouse. We didn't wait and got a pic with Minnie later in the day in about 10 minutes.","Neutral"
"All I have to say is that our theme parks in the UK are better than here. My expectations were high and I just found it ok. Nothing too spectacular...except for the parade. That was decent.","Neutral"
"We Spent a week in the Euro Disney resort which after USA was a HUGE letdown. But I dont think it was totally Disneys fault.. Anyway Buffalo Bills......... Not what it says on the tin!!!!I went there as a birthday treat with my 12 yr old daughter, The build up to the show was electric and I must say the promise of  Endless BEER  was a plus...(it was my birthday). The waiters seemed like they had seen 1 show to many and just wanted the end of the night to come.. We got split into 4 RANCHES and all each team got a captain who's job it was to get there section of the crowd all YEHARRRED up. My half pint glass was filled with a random beer(lager) which went down a treat and I managed to catch the waiter as he made his way back to the service area for a topup (2 x half pint glases). The light went down and the show started Then a lot of horses with riders holding flags going round and round the arena for 5 mins while we all claped to the music. My glass was empty but there was no sign of the waiters. Enter BUFFALO BILL.. spouted on about the wild west and how much he loved france.. (playing to the crowd I would think). Enter annie oakley (the best shot in     well eurodisney maybe.. As all the  SHOOTING DEMONSTRATIONS  were blanks and nifty electronics. And before you say.... NO im not stupid I wasn't expecting some special ops markswomen... During this time the waiter turned up!!!!! oh joy my glass was begining to get dry.. but NO he had a metal pot of chili and in true wild west fashion was SLOPPING it into our bowls Table Laps  as it was so dark You could not see what you were eating and most of the people sitting around me didn't touch it for this reason including me and daughter. Enter the grand SITTING BULL..(Who's name should really be   STANDING AROUND DOING NOTHING BULL) Who chanted a few phrases then went and stood on a makeshift mountain for 10 mins... YES 10 MINS... still chanting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can only assume he need to fill a gap in the show. YEHAAAAAA   the waiter was back.. But only to clear the still full bowls of chili. This time I asked for a re fill of my drink!!!! A blank look later and he was gone. Another ten minuets past while Chief BULL'S gang were screaming and chasing half a dozen buffalo's around the arena. All of this stampeading in the dust didnt help our already very dry mouths. And still no sign of the waiter. Along came the main  TEXAS STYLE BARBECUE  meal of the night:  quoteSausage with herbs,Roasted ChickenRanch house smoked ribs, Texan vegetablesOld fashioned potatoesWarm apple cobbler with vanilla ice creamA Garlic sausage......A chicken leg with a dolop of barbecue sauceA rib (bone with fat)peas and sweatcornboiled pottatoeswarm apple (with all the bits) cobbler and ice cream.OH and a re fill.......... (3 x half pint glases).Soon this was all cleared away and again the suspect food was left on the plate by alot of people inc us. (why would you eat chicken thats been mass cooked, in the dark???)coffe cups were offered in replace for the glasses which I declined and again asked for a re fill. He went and returned with the words.....  NO MORE  and carried on to clear all the glasses away.. SHOCKED wasn't the word.Team games took place duing the clean up which was the highlight of the night and team pride became a must..(and it took your mind of the fact the glasses had gone forever) Alot of hat swinging and YEEEHAARRRRING later and it was Buffalo Bill's turn to say goodbye and to ask us all to clap yeehaaar etc, for the team of rough riders, Annie (use a real gun) Oakley and Chief (I want to wave my feathers around and chant) Bull. So in a nutshell: 59euro's, A Poor meal, A show that doesnt match the leaflet but not THAT bad, and NOT all the beer you want. You do get to keep your hat and the kids will prob love it. Go in a large group and I would guess you also would have a great time as long as the meal wasnt an issue.","Negative"
"Compared to the US parks, this is just not the same. Staff often seemed disinterested and lacked the sparkle of their american colleagues. My main issue was smoking in public areas. While this is the cultural norm in France, it is banned in the park with designated smoking areas in place. However, the rule is not enforced at all so expect to have people smoking all over the place which is uncomfortable when you are crowded together in queues or when watching parades. I saw people smoking right in front of other peoples children and cast members who did nothing to enforce the no smoking policy. When I mentioned it to guest relations they told me that they has been instructed not to enforce the policy so as not to upset their majority smoker customer base.","Negative"
"My husband and I visited Disneyland Paris together as part of our honeymoon. The setting is wonderful   the attention to detail in the props and decorations around the park is really wonderful. They were preparing for halloween when we visited and the pumpkin statues of Disney characters dotted around the park were great. The rides we went on were great (particularly the Phantom Manor and the Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast) although the queues were very long at points. The line for the Disney railroad was probably close to an hour at one point! The main disappointment was the food   vegetarian choices were poor. There were a few fast good areas for things like burgers but when we looked at the actual restaurants they were very expensive   some were around    50 . Another aspect with the food was that we decided to wait until after the 5.30pm parade (which was brilliant) to get dinner but all of the food places were closing at 6pm. A slightly later opening would have been helpful. Overall though it's a lovely experience and all of the children in particular seemed to be having a blast. I'd recommend visiting. ","Positive"
"We've spent here two days with 3 kids (ages 1 , 4  and 7) sleeping at a nearby Best WesternWe've been to both parks   first day to Disneyland, second day to the Adventure parkEach day we split into two heading back to the motel for a noon nap   rest   regain energydoing this was really great as it allowed us to maximize the experience and have the kids up till late to see the parade & night events, which are amazing!The parade (at Disneyland) was by far more unique and impressiveTransport   at first we used the shuttle with a day pass (5$ per adult, 2$ per child). It wasn't efficient. We spent 20  minutes for each shuttle (as it happened 3 times I wouldn't say it's just our bad luck...) and it was more of a hustle than anything else. One time, for the sake of discussion, I even headed to the motel by foot, and guess what... I got there 10 minutes ahead of them!The second day we took the car into the parking lot (Mickey) and from there the tram to downtown Disney   was way more efficient and this is my recommendation to you, just take the car, pay the 18$ day pass for the parking lot and head in   out as much as you'd like. BTW   the load on the tram at night, after the show, was lower compared with the load of passengers awaiting the shuttlesFood   damn, what a rip off... At least at the adventure park there was good beer!Undersized portions with a crappy (pardon my french) nutrition contribution. And lousy taste, making any other fast food feel like an upscale restaurantThe adventure park is cool, smaller, we could fit all in one day (2 parts as mentioned above) with no problem. The cars race was amazing!!!! Highly recommended, we did it twice, and it is always packed, so make sure to have the fastness asap. It is near the entrance, right at the bugs' land gate. This park is also not as crowded as the Disneyland one.In Disneyland, do note that after the show it's a looooong way out. And slowYet, it is damn fun and kids loved it. So did we. We've got enough of this for the decadeSee ya next time!","Neutral"
"We visited for 2 days over Easter 2015 and visited both parks in that time.By stopping at a Disney hotel we were blessed with the perk of getting into the park 2 hours before the general public. Although only Main Street, Discoveryland and Fantasyland are open early we were able to do Buzz's Laser Blast, Star Tours and Pinocchio in that time, as well as get near the front of the queue for Frontierland's opening to get on Big Thunder for a 30 min queue only.As the Studio's park did not open early, we chose to use the early morning perk on day 2 to get a photo with Mickey and Minnie on Main Street. Donald and Goofy were also available, but we left them to queue for the Studios park after our 45 min queue for Mickey & Minnie.Food and drink is expensive, so we took water and snacks in our rucksacks, although we did eat and Pizza Planet buffet on day 2 (   19.99 per adult for an all you can eat pizza and pasta buffet   reasonabley filling and recommended). We also had some cheesey hot dogs for about    7 from Casey's on the top of main street, which were very nice.On day 1 we were happy to escape the park at 11.30 and head to Planet Hollywood in Disney Village ahead of the rush.I was a little disappointed with it being the Easter holidays that so many rides were closed for renovation including Dumbo, Space Mountain and the entrance to Adventureland.Also having been to both Florida and California Disney's some of the counterpart rides are not quite as good (Phantom Manor being a good example). Big Thunder is on a par and it's good to be set on it's own island reached underground. When we went on it for the 2nd time on day 1 it broke down 3 4 through. We had to be rescued and taken off the ride, but were given a free fastpass to use next day. It was very exciting to see behind the scenes of the ride as we were led in single file off the ride.The 5.30pm parade was excellent, however queues soon build up and some people are prone to push in. The Disney Dreams end of the day show is also a first class spectacular. I found all staff to be happy and polite at all times.Next visit I think I would prefer to spend more time in the Studios park, as it has more thrill rides. This park is more aimed for the younger audiance, but still great for all ages and Disney lovers.","Positive"

"We have been coming to Disney for Fifteen years now, we have taken our children and now our Granchildren. Euro Disney Paris is easy to get to, and amazing when you arrive to the moment you leave. The Disney staff are brilliant with both adults and children alike. It can prove to be a little expensive when taking your family to the shops or restaurants, however it is truly worthwhile to see your families faces when they are in the parks. Enjoy your trip to Disney, we go back every year it is that good.","Positive"
"Not brilliant, attractions are standard and expect queues. Given that a lot of English visit, McDonalds serve tea but NO milk and typically dismissive if you ask for some. May be a minor point but sort of sums up the French attitude to British tourists. Wouldn't rush back to visit either the centre or the country to be honest.","Neutral"
"I think Disneyland is for kids. The most of attraction are not made me excited. But I really like the  fireworks huge show at castle. It's very marvelous. Some food in Disneyland is not delicious.","Neutral"
"We have been to Disney in the past. Many years ago, it was so clean. People were constantly picking trash up and you never saw any on the ground. We were so disappointed this time with the amount of trash and food laying around. Rides were continuously breaking. The crowds were horrible. The food, which I thought used to be good, was awful. We tried several meals and none of them were good. Overall, very disappointed with Disneyland this trip. We spent almost $2000 for 3 days. Too expensive and the young people working at Disney don't seem to care as much as employees used to years ago. Also, I always remember employees being happy, almost to the point of being too happy. This time there were many unhappy employees. Not an enjoyable experience.","Neutral"
"Our 4th time in 4 years. We are from PA but travel to CA because we find this Disney so much easier to navigate than Florida. Our kids are 5 & 8. We usually come mid Sept. Perfect. The weather is hot but not boiling, you can still swim, and ride water rides but not be too hot. The park is all decorated for Fall Halloween   fun! It was busy but not over whelming crowded. We love it! Cast members wonderful. Do Fast Pass, its worth it. Food was good. We did Big Thunder Bar b que for lunch; a little more money but its all decorated for fall and its nice to take a break and sit down, food was good, all you can eat. Must do rides are NEW STAR Tours (do first), Space Mountain, Big Thunder railroad, Jungle Cruise, Pirates was closed (Bummer!), Splash Mountain, Matterhorn. My only 2 complaints are this: Park opened at 10:00 and closed at 8:00. I wish it would have opened maybe at 9:00 and closed more like 10:00. A few more hours would have been nice and not as rushed. Also watch if you are in park at dark. The main street area is well lighted but all others are DARK. My son fell on a curb that was very hard to see. They need to lighten up the rest of park after dark. Ate also at Mexican restaurant (great food and nice atmopshere!) Stayed on site for first time this year at Paradise Pier   great stay (see seperate review for that). Didnt have problems with line cutting, everyone friendly and happy to be there! (As we all should be!) Enjoy and have fun!","Positive"
"We were visiting from out of state. Several rides were closed. It would have been nice to know this ahead of time. Very crowded. It also would have been nice to have the website mention Grad Nite   had the mentioned it along with the closed rides we would have scheduled our visit at a different time. There were several issues with fast passes as well.","Neutral"
"This was second visit to this park and definately my last. I expected large crowds but the queues for everything from the rides, to the food outlets, toilets, tickets, left luggage was so tiring and endlessly frustrating that my 7 year old grand daughter started to say, well that will be 60 mins of my life I wont get back! Even the fast track ticket system failed to deliver with rides breaking down and a faulty magnetic strip. Many of the shows attractions where we thought there would be chance to give the legs a rest, you could not enjoy because they were designed for standing only giving a very restricted view for both children and adults. eg Peter Pan Show, and others were only memorable by our aching muscles. However the Parades continue to deliver the disney magic but the park itself was a huge disappointment.","Negative"
"Unfortunately our expectations were to high. We thought that we will have a wonderful time in such a great park. I can say that it was waist of money 288 euro for entrance and had to wait hours in long queues to meet Micky or to have a ride. My opinion is that the park is a shopping market with huge prices. ","Negative"
"I'm glad I visited this park! One of my dreams is to visit all the Disney Resorts. I wish this park made me feel the same magic that the American parks do. You can defiantly tell that this park isn't run by Disney. The cast members don't have the same Disney spirit that they do in the states & the park is kinda run down. What I enjoyed about the park(s) is the different attractions and experiences it had to offer. I especially enjoyed seeing star tours in it's original state (even though it was in French). You can also use the glow with the show ears.","Neutral"
"We've been to Orlando and Anaheim...we weren't looking to compare, necessarily, but you can't help but notice what's lacking. First of all, a couple of attractions we were looking forward to most (Phantom Manor, Pirates of the Caribbean) were closed for renovation (understandable they'd want to do that in the off season), so I won't hold that against them. Thoughts: there seemed to be a little lack of  branding.  We ate lunch at Fuente del Oro Restaurante  the food was pretty good, but there was nothing Disney about it. No Mickey, no nothing. The park staff was not Disney friendly or attentive. I know Disneyland Paris started out as EuroDisney, but now it is French  you'd think there'd be more integration of French Disney: Beauty and the Beast, Aristocats, Ratatouille (I think there might be a restaurant). The Buzz Lightyear ride is sadly inferior to the one in Florida (?)  same laser shooting concept, with no feel of excitement or accomplishment  also, it stopped several times! The Snow White ride was crazy fast, and not in an exciting way  it felt very rushed. The only ride that I found to be superior to Orlando was It's a Small World  it was very fresh looking and very pretty and well done. Loved that the train dropped us off right at the entrance. Did not love that you could not go directly back to the train  had to wander through downtown Disney a bit before reaching the station. Those are just my thoughts.","Neutral"
"I visited the park in july 2010 with my younger sister. We found it easy to get to, using the RER. The parks howver, i found overpriced and poorly managed. It seemed a lot smaller and poorly organised than its Floridian counterpart. If you have never been to any disney parks before then maybe you will be impressed but overall I found it to be just ok and wouldnt rush back. We arrived at 9am and left at 4pm including time to go to Planet Hollywood, which again, was just OK.","Neutral"
"The price to get in here was pretty steep for what you get for it. The Gulch mine cart ride was well worth it and the boat trip around the island at adventure land (I think) was entertaining. The Star Wars ride was thrilling through pitch darkness but the wait for this ride was ridiculous and no fans or coolers to keep such a large number of people cool in high heat and humidity while they wait. We just waited for long periods of time in line after line for short rides. There weren't too many spots to sit down to rest and you could only buy the designated branded items on sale at their high prices for food and drinks. The family were pretty frazzled by early afternoon and we pulled the pin only to have to wait in lines for the train to stand all the way back to the hotel. ","Negative"
"They are rude and loud. Eat anything anywhere. I am a Chinese too but just can not understand how they can be this bad. If you have young kid then it is not a place for your family. You really don't want your kid to see or learn anything there.","Negative"
"I was so excited to be going to Disney, its not just for kids after all!Its really easy to get to (and relatively cheap in a taxi too), we got there early, as it was opening and I was bursting to get in.Have to say, we left after 4 hours, you can't blame Disney for the heat  humidity but its hard going. There is not as much to see  do as you would expect, Oblivion was shut and overall I left dissapointed. Euro Disney is far better.","Neutral"
"First time ever going to Disneyland and I guess I was expecting big things. The place was pretty but it lacked the    magic    that it had promised. I felt like I spent the whole 5 days in a queue. Queue for food, for entry, the toilet, the rides, the autographs of the characters. The queues for the rides and the characters were around 45 minutes unless you did the fast pass. It zapped out the fun and excitement for the kids too. They were frustrated and fed up of having the queue for everything. Better planning is needed. I understand they are limited for what they can do for the rides but the autographs could be better managed. And lets be honest you could have more than one character in one place.... i am sure the children wouldn   t notice!","Neutral"
"it was a great experience for 1st timer to visit the Disneyland in HK. The lion king musical show and the golden mickey show are a MUST watch in Disneyland. Souvenirs all are pretty enough as for me is not too expensive even I didn't not buy much. Not encourage to bring kids that below age3 years old as it is not so convenient. Some food price is expensive but there are food with affordable price as well. Not to bring any outside food. can bring empty drinking bottle as there are water refillable nearby each of the washroom. Bring umbrella or caps and sunglasses. handicap people got priority. suggest to visit on weekday to avoid crowd. May is a bad day as raining heavily and the fireworks show was cancelled in the end. what's a pity!","Positive"
"We took our 3 and half year old to Disneyland on the first Friday after the Chinese New Year. As most people were still on their holidays we were expecting it to be packed out. It was very crowded with queues at all the attractions....More","Negative"
"We went to disney hong kong as a lot of people say is very nice. We went on monday which was a good choice because it was not busy. When we came in and arrived at main street i excpected that this where real buildings but most of them are just front panels with on top plastic printed canvas looked cheap. As we are a family of 3 and our kid is 11 years old he looks for rides but all in all there where maybe 8 or 10 rides which he likes or are fun for him. We Walked all the park and within 4 hours you seen every thing. You would think the disney figures would walk the park but no. Also most of the buildings are either food kiosk, restaurants or souvinier shops. The best area is adventure land which is setup nicely. If you are in hong kong and you want to go to attraction go to ocean park much better. For the price 499 for adult it was a disapointment","Negative"
"Have just been back to Disneyland in Paris and it is still a great place to visit.You do need to plan and be organised and realise if you don't watch it you can spend a lot of money. We stayed off sight this time which was good. When we drove in we didn't park in the main car park (I do think 15 euros is a ripoff just to park your car) but parked at the station   worked out a bit cheaper and if youre not planning on staying the full day could be fair bit cheaper. It's also closer to walk to the parks too. We used to bring in some sandwiches and snacks each day   although they searched your bags they didn't mind. A lot of people did this and as long as you didn't sit in the cafes and restaurants eating your sandwiches they didn't seem to mind. We also kept water and coke in the freezer at our accommodation and this defrosted during the day but meant we had a good supply of ice cold water and coke.We spent a total of 2 days in the park and although both bank holidays in France did everything except Dumbo. Made good use of fastpass and the staff were very organised at getting people on and off the rides to keep the queues moving often quicker than the wait times. Staff very friendly and attentive, rides still great and pleanty of characters milling around for photos. Souvenirs and food generally expensive but there are some things to buy which aren't too badly priced but most toys you'll find cheaper in the Disney Store in the UK. Park really clean and tidy and I still say that out of all the Disney Parks we have been to this one is the best themed and most picturesque. Definatley recommend but plan ahead to ensure you have a great time.","Positive"
"So, we planned to visit Disneyland Paris, and because my wife and kid were eager to spend quality time, we booked a hotel in the area, not in Paris. First day we went to the village, it was ok but we were not impressed by the shops or restaurants. The airship and little boats were closed because of  strong wind  and it wasn't windy at all. We wish it was because the weather was hot. Next day we went early morning to the studio and the park. Few things1  you cant tell much about each ride before you go into. Difficult to know which ones you like. My kid didn't want scary stuff and by mistake we went into 2, not knowing till too late2  I bought Gopro specifically to take videos of the rids. That wasn't allowed and although it was easy to still do so, I respected the law but was deeply disappointed3  The rids themselves are like 3 10 in terms of attractiveness. If you take the characters out, I am sure non of the rids will be attractive by itself4  the worst thing that happened was at night. We specifically wanted to attend the show at 11:00 pm. We went back to the hotel and came back 10:50pm, not realizing that we forgot the tickets. So I quickly jumped into the car, brought the tickets and arrived around 11:08. And guess what, we were not allowed to enter. You can have rules and regulation, but this business is about full experience of mostly  one time  visitors . It was us and an other family trying hard to enter, but no luck. That was the most important item in my wife's  to do  list and we could have at least seen the last part of the show. We wouldn't have made any difference in the closing time because we would for sure go out once the show finishes. It might be few minutes late from the closing time, but it meant 50% of someones vacation. Anyway, i share part of the responsibility, but the staff could have done better to put a smile in my kid's face without causing anyone any tribble","Neutral"
"Got on an RER train from Paris and was an easy ride. Took only an hour and the train ticket price wasn't that bad. (7.50 euros one way).Got there at around 10.30am. There already was a good crowd.There were lots of rides and it only took an average of 10 15 mins wait. Not enough rides though, in my opinion.I went with my partner and a 2 year old. There was nothing much interesting for my Disney Cars fan 2 year old son. The closest was Autopia (which we enjoyed). We didn't realise that Cars was in the other park. It was too late, we were already in Disneyland Park.We got on a few rides and looked around. We enjoyed the train that went around the park. We spent most of our time in Adventureland as it was better for boys. We had lunch there and it was so expensive.The projector screen in the lunch area was terrible. Our tv was a lot better quality than that. You wouldn't expect less from Disney! The short clips were entertaining but the screen quality was crap. The Nescafe vending machines were also horrible. 3 euros for a teeny tiny cup. One out of the two machines was broken. The toilets were horrible. It was as if nobody bothered to clean it. The mirrors were disgusting, they looked like they haven't been cleaned since the park opened. The toilets were smelly. The hand driers were dirty. And none of them were themed.There weren't enough customer service attendants either. It wasn't easy looking for someone for directions. There weren't enough signs to tell you where to go (directions to toilets and different areas of the park). The worst part is that we didn't see a single character mascot. Oh, we did. Belle. At 10.30am with the security guard going to her post. Looked like she just woke up. And also, when we left the park, we went to the restaurant areas and found the Mickey Cafe way at the end of the walk, and there were Pluto, Goofy and Hook inside. That was it.The grand finale was great but not as great as Florida. Paris' finale was all just projection based. (Impressive projector though). No actual characters singing and dancing live. Although there were great water  and fireworks.The park was packed but it was not too bad. It was bearable. (Apart from the rude Parisiens).There were also more Disney stores than rides. The prices of items were double that of Disney Stores in London! What a scam.My son was bored most of the time. We weren't really impressed. Although we could say that we had a good day overall. I wouldn't really go back again. But it's good to experience it at least once.","Neutral"
"We love Disneyland. We go appx once every two years. We've noticed more and more areas getting roped off for Fantasmic, fireworks, parades, bands, etc. Although we love these features, we HATE the chaos the roped off areas creates. Last night, the crowd was forced behind Pirates in New Orleans square, along where Indiana Jones & the Jungle Cruise are. This was an absolute zoo with the crowd. Claustrophobic. I don't freak out with crowds, but this was ridiculous. I'll avoid those areas during show times in the future.But as always, staff was friendly and helpful. Food is better than expected. Fast pass is awesome (if you get a good system with it), and the magic is there. The castle looks cool with the 60th anniversary decorations! And the new light parade is fantastic!!","Positive"
"The hotel is nice, although not many activities for children, you simply stay there and enjoy the room. You have to eat in the hotel, which is very expensive. Went swimming with the kids, and get bitten by fleas in the garden (about 50 bites). It took me 2 weeks to heal. I had a week of unbearable suffering of itchiness.","Neutral"
"A very lovely, a very, very, hot Disney visit! Had a great day here. Firstly, it is so easy to get to from either Hing Kong Centre or Kowloon, taking the MTR. Got here upon opening and were able to get in a number of rides with minimal wait times. The park has many familiarities of the US sites, similar    lands    so it   s very easy to navigate, although The Hing Kong park seems smaller and more walkable. Rides my kid loved: Space Mountain (a different name), the Toy Story Hot Wheels ride was awesome, and of course we rode the Grizzly Mine Cars about three times. Food: prices approximate to other parks. If it is warm out, bring as much water as you can. If you only want Western food there are some spots to get this. Overall, I would go again. I was thrilled by wait times, but maybe this was just luck. There were a number of characters we didn   t recognize because they are popular with Disney Japan, but this had no impact on us. The castle was very small and undergoing renovations so it   s too bad we missed that. Parade was great. Check for weather, bring water, enjoy!","Positive"
"It's pretty obvious that this place is not 100 percent owned by Disney. It's more like a mid class local theme park. Many areas were closed. Hardly a character to be seen on site.Definitely not enough employees walking around working. Almost every ride we were on had to stop unexpectedly for some reason or another. Definitely don't consider this a standard Disney park. It's not.The family had fun day with the rides and activities we did, but as we compared it to Disney World in Orlando, it didn't come close.","Neutral"
"We loved Disneyland, but we didn't use the app. Many friends said, use the app. We didn't. Regrets. We had to search for characters. They are all on a limited schedule, spread out over the park and many leave as early as 330 pm. Chasing prevented us from being able to go on more rides. Park is always crowded. Fast pass is way to go. Absolutely loved Soaring Around the World. Adventure land and Frontier land need updating.","Positive"
"After paying for 3 days at the park and 3 nights In an associated nearby hotel, we left after 1 day. Awful awful.75minute queues for 2 minute rides. Rides were old and rough. Fast pass option hardly worth the effort as you can only have 1 active at a time. We did 3 rides by 3.30pm. Awful. So so disappointing. We skipped the hotel and headed back to paris for an extra few nights . I felt sad for all the families who had saved hard to be there and promised their kids a good time. I did not see anyone smiling all day.","Negative"
"Just returned from a family trip, not impressed, been going to dlrp for 12 years, even had honeymoon there but i wont be going back. Took my daughter,partner and grandson, me and daughter been before and rest had not. So upsetting, rides closed, hardly any characters n parades...once upon a disney you couldnt breathe without characters at your feet n parades every hour ish...no more! It really disappointed me after so many years and much money spent that the magic has left the once magical place.","Negative"
"Big park. Not near as big as the original. But very good size. Very long ques at all attractions. The most popular over 1h 2,5h waiting time. And you have to be there before opening time to get fast pass :(. Food... Normal park standard.. Service is bad. So few park people to help. Not all cassiers were open in the store. Few signs and informasion places. Waiting time at the entrance to the attraction was often very wrong....","Neutral"
"Having visited Florida twice and Disneyland Paris twice before I kind of knew what to expect but this was the first Disney trip with my 3 year old daughter and I think I forgot how horrendous queuing with a toddler is! We spent 3 nights and 4 days at the parks and managed to cover most attractions in this time. I will break my review into positive and negative points as I want people to have a good idea of what it's like there.Positives:* Character meet and greets due to the rain we found quite a few characters with no queue which was a bonus!* Cafe Mickey meal with characters  my 3 year old thought she was in heaven when Mickey came to our table, no dinner will ever be the same again for her!* Buffalo Bill's wild west show amazing live action show featuring real cowboys, Native Americans, buffalo, cattle and lots of horses!* The 20th anniversary light show was amazing, I have never seen anything like it before and it was well worth a visit.* Fastpass well worth doing if you plan your rides ahead of time.* Parades  my daughters face lit up when we saw the stars with cars parade. Negatives:* The state of the toilets in the parks  at times they were dirty and at other times disgusting. I do not think Walt Disney would approve of faeces smeared all over them!* The prices of food and drink take your own or buy in the station shop outside the park.* The rudeness of the French  I know that may be contraversial but when they blow cigarette smoke in your childs face whilst waiting for a queue and proceed to queue jump and barge you out of the way it begins to grate on you!* The overhyped security, long queues just to get into the park as bags are xrayed through one tired looking machine and french police wandering about with big guns just outside the park!* Queues everywhere, wouldn't be so bad but as one previous reviewer noted many are uncovered which in the rain is not much fun!Overall it was a good experience with some drawbacks but my 3 year old had the time of her life and that's all that matters, after all if your kids are happy then i'm happy!","Neutral"
"Fellow travellers. I write as a guide to my experience with HK Disneyland. Some 3 months ago I contacted Disneyland Reservation Centre via email and I told them we are coming to Hong Hong and visiting Disneyland on May 21st especially because it was my granddaughter's 4th birthday and if there is anything we can do to make her birthday a little more special. Reservation wrote back to me a week later and said if I order a cake with them Mickey Mouse and friends will bring it to our table for a sing along, as we are having our lunch at the Enchanted Garden Restaurant. When we got to HK on 14 05 12 I rang them to order the cake I was then told all the above were not true because the Enchanted Garden Restaurant does not open on weekdays and Mickey cannot enter into any of the other restaurants. Is this the normal functioning Disneyland? Was the promise a mere attracting for us to go to HK? I could not think of anything else.While we were there we noticed a little, perhaps 5 years old Chinese girl who was too frighten to get on the Flying Dumbo ride so her mother took her off the ride. On their return to the rest of the family I noticed the little girls father really gave her a few hard slaps on her face. I approached the father and told him he had no rights to hit her like that. The whole family obvious couldn't understand English because they just ignored me. I approached a ground staff and I asked him to call security. He asked me why so I told him of what I have seen and pointed the father out to him. He, unbelievably, told me that there is nothing he could or will do about it. I can understand that Hong Kong now rely more on the rich tourism from mainland China more so than from the European countries but this is unthinkable. Disneyland is suppose to be a place for all children to enjoy themselves without fear of anything but yet the employers within cannot offer them the slightest protection. Hong Kong for me again? Not in this life time. By the way, I was born there.","Neutral"
"the Disneyland in Hong Kong is so small if you compare with the one in Japan and the United States. You could pretty much only need 3 hours to visit the whole theme park when there are not many visitors around. The facilities are relatively new comparing the other Disneyland in other countries but there are not much surprise as it is considered a very standard  Disneyland . Hotel is not too bad but not necessary since it will not take too much time to go around the whole park. food is not as great as expected!!","Neutral"
"It's ok. It's really expensive for not that much. You can walk around the park in about an hour. Lines are way too long. The rides are very cool, if you have the patience to wait on the lines. If you don't go, you didn't miss out.","Negative"
"I have visited Disneyland Paris twice before   and both times had a very enjoyable experience. However, my most recent visit (over the last weekend in May 2016) was very disappointing. A few rides were shut for refurbishment, including a couple of the bigger attractions, which pushed up queue times on other rides; additionally, some further rides shut for a portion of our visit or experienced technical difficulties which led to even longer queues. On one occasion, we queued for over an hour for one ride to then be told that it was being closed   without any further information given to us either whilst we queued or after we were told to leave.Access to the Princesses is very limited   either you have to pay for the most expensive restaurant on the site (which I have done previously) or queue an extraordinary amount of time at the Princess Pavilion. We queued for over three hours (despite being told the queue only lasted for two hours, after we joined it 10 minutes from the park opening) to spend a couple of minutes with one Disney Princess. Again, there was no communication given whilst we queued. Following this we couldn't even eat at the park as the queues for restaurants were out of the door at every establishment. I suspect this was due to the bad weather but, being based in France, you think this would be accommodated for.I am a huge Disney fan so it saddens me to be so negative but I did find my experience lacking compared to previous visits.","Negative"
"We had spent two days in Disneyland Paris and it was fantastic. The rides are superb, although many are more for teenagers and adults rather then kids, but that   s ok. Literally all staff members are extremely friendly and the landscaping and the conditions of the park is immaculate. Too and that some of the attractions are closed for renovation, but how else would they do it. The waiting times are an issue, although we had a so called Disney greencard that enables you to enter all attractions with almost no waiting through the exit, but you only get these cards of one of the family or group members is handicapped. The only downside are the prices. I didn   t expect Disney to be cheap, but that is too much: 289    for 2 days just for the tickets, 40    for each day parking, 25    for a stroller, 15    for a hotdog menu (hotdog, fries and beverage) etc etc etc. but at the end of the day we and our son loved it and would go back in no time!","Positive"
"Ok, we spent 3 days walking around the park. It's just way too populated to actual enjoy it. For 2 days it was fairly busy but the 3rd day was hurrendous. You have people pushing in front of others trying to get on rubbish rides like there lives depended on it!We went with our disabled son. The thing they don't advertise is that if you go to the town hall they give you a disabled badge so you can skip the queues. This was a life saver BUT we were only lucky to get the info to obtain it on the second day by chance.My main issue is that they CHARGE to use a stroller or wheel chair! Never known anyone do this for a disabled child. This is morally wrong and the park needs to sort this out! Oh not only is it    15 per day but if you want to take it to your hotel you have to fork out a further    50 deposit. Plus every single time you take it past the gate you have to produce the letter...a nightmare when you have 4 children to hold onto. The toilets on the 3rd day in the park were disgusting. Not cleaned nearly enough. The show held in the park was great the first time...but very repetitive.Take my word for it....1 whole day and evening is all you need. Anymore and u get fed up of bumping into people, constantly waiting in queues for rides which last less than a minute.Best part is disabled access to the rides...worsed is paying to use a wheel chair. All in all it was ok, will we go back? Nope.","Negative"
"It's so small if there was no line up you can finish the whole place in a few hours. The worse part of this place are the visitors. Many of them are from mainland china. They will elbow the hell out of you to budge in line and argue till there's no tomorrow and ruin your day. You will get stepped on, pushed, spat on, and disrespected every way possible. This place can't be any worse. Don't go with your family if you have any young or elderly. Someone will get hurt. I was full of bruises after a day a the park. One of the most strenuous day of my life for sure.","Negative"
"When it comes to Disney, you expect wonderful things, but we were very disappointed with our overall experience here on our recent visit. The park is very small and doesn't have the magical vibe that Anaheim Disneyland exhibits. The majority of staff that we encountered had the personalities of bricks and showed no happiness or excitement. Food options were very average and opportunities for photos with characters were limited. With the park closing at approx 8:45pm on the day we visited, photos with Mickey and Minnie were closed off at 4pm, causing much disappointment from numerous visitors. The general upkeep of the park also seemed quite poor, with overgrown gardens and dirty grounds in some areas. While there was the advantage of much shorter queues for rides, this Disneyland just feels like another average theme park and doesn't even come close to comparing with the original in Anaheim. I wouldn't recommend visiting this theme park.","Negative"
"We visited here in February 2016 on a day when the locals should be in school ! What a joke ! There were so many children here on the Tuesday we went, it was inbelievable. The queues for the characters was ridiculous and very badly organised. We queued on a very hot day outside for well over an hour just to get a photo with Minnie ! Several rides were closed. In Florida Disney Park, they have covered or sheltered walk ways for queues   this place has NOTHING. You have to stand in the sweltering heat. The evening was a nightmare, when the locals, who buy cheap 'yearly' tickets for this place bombard it. The place gets dangerously crowded and we simply could not move when the electric light parade and fireworks were on. I was travelling with a disabled person with a wheelchair, and the evening was really frightening trying to get through the crowds. The staff are not very helpful   even at one time being told to take the wheelchair to an enclosure, just to be told by another to leave !! There is NO CROWD control at all. They let in far too many people. This place should be about FUN. They make it about MONEY. I would definitely NOT recommend this park   go to Hollywood Universal Studios instead.Visited February 2016","Negative"
"We are Disney fanatics. One of the big reasons for going to Paris was to see DLP! And we were, I am sad to say, disappointed. Although there are some very cool rides, and the Disneyland Park itself is very pretty, it lacks the magic of the US parks. Staff are not at all friendly (such a stereotype, but it is true), the Studios park is quite ugly and poorly themed, and crowd control is zero. There are several rides that are certainly worth going to  and really, they DO make the trip worthwhile, just be prepared for an experience where guests are viewed as some sort of irritating nuisance. NO ONE will tell you to have a magical day here. We had seasons passes  and I had to FIGHT to get them because I kept my maiden name, my husband hadn't joined us, and the staff refused to believe that my children were mine. It was a nightmare experience.GREAT RIDES AT STUDIOS: Ratatouille is well worth it! IT is a very innovative dark ride. We ate at the restaurant and it was very poor, and we waited for two hours beyond our reservation... but the d  cor is very very well done. The ride makes you feel that you actually are a tiny mouse in a French kitchen! The queue is breathtaking... you wait on the rooftops of Paris. I would return to Disneyland just for this queue.CRUSHES COASTER: the lines are terrible, even at rope drop expect to wait up to an hour. but.. the ride is astonishing! It blends a dark ride with an indoor coaster and my kids couldn't get enough. Rude ride operators questioned my daughter if she was 7 every time we rode, but other than that we loved this ride. Even the queue is cool, you wait on a pier in Sydney. It perfectly simulates the experience of riding the current with the turtles from Finding Nemo.TOWER OF TERROR: my kids hated the one in Orlando... this is an abbreviated version, and just right for my kids... it has the drop thrill but less of the ghost story.ATTRACTIONS WORTH SEEING AT DISNEYLAND PARK:Big Thunder Mountain Railroad: this is the longest version of this ride at any Disney park... and you can tell! three lift hills of awesome family fun! We rode this 50 times last summer. Pirates of the Caribbean: this blends the gorgeous queue of the Orlando park with the long ride of the California park... and it includes a few big surprises! Our favorite version of this ride.Disney Dreams: the nighttime show is great... but we waited 2 hours to see it and still didn't have the best seats. Disney needs to improve viewing for this show and perhaps introduce a fastpass for a viewing area. It was not fun to wait 2 hours... one night we showed up a mere 90 minutes early and there was no hope that we would get a spot to sit to see the show.Walk Throughs: there are some cool ones here  Jules Verne's submarine, Aladdin, an Alice in Wonderland walk through... neat stuff.It is super easy to get to from Paris  there is one train that goes directly to the entrance, it was never crowded and always air conditioned. I would never stay at this resort  the staff are far too unfriendly, and the access from the city of Paris is just too convenient (you are deposited from the train very few steps from the front gate)","Neutral"
"Well what a disappointment. We have just finished a 3 day visit to Disneyland Paris and have come away very disappointed and deflated. So what went wrong. Firstly we picked the wrong week. You would think that booking in May June you would have had some decent weather but no 3 days of heavy rain with the occasional thunderstorm nothing Disney could have done about that really but what was annoying is the profit they must have made on the sales of poncho rain coats at 10 euros a throw. Nearly everyone had to buy one as the weather was so bad. The most annoying thing was on our arrival 19 of the 45 attractions were closed for refurbishment. This included Star tours our favourite ride in Orlando , big Thunder mountain , the dragon ride , autopia, adventure island , Aladdin, Peter Pan,pirate beach Pocahontas village,rock and roll coaster to name a few. It just felt like everything good was closed. Why oh why could they have not planned this better and just had 1 or maybe 2 attractions closed at a time. Walking round and seeing everything boarded up was heartbreaking for my little boy. Well and truly disappointed especially after spending well over   2000 of our hard earned money on a 5 day getaway.","Negative"
"Disney hotel is very worn, long queues at all the attractions, and all the serving places, acidic or indifferent service staff, and much construction mess, not a place I would recommend to others","Negative"
"We purchased our tickets from a great website attractiontix we got a better deal than purchasing from disney online it was quick and easy you get an instant voucher by email and print it out take it to the ticket booth at disney they scan it and give you your tickets we purchased multi park tickets 4 days for the price of 3 but they do many offers I would recommend anyone to check this site.","Positive"
"Disneyland very crowded with long waits for rides . Also prices are ridiculous for food and also entry.  In saying that everyone needs to visit Disneyland once in their life.  The night time parade and fireworks was brilliant.","Neutral"
"A Saturday in August was not the best time to visit. This whole place was full of queues and hardly any of the staff had a smile on their face. Sightings of the characters were few and far between. My little girl was so excited to see Mickey Mouse for two minutes after a nearly 90 minute wait. We saw daisy while we were making our way to a ride. She was making her way to the dressing rooms just behind us and was with a minder. There were very few people around and my daughter was so excited to see her. She wanted to go up and say hello but the minder just ignored her and escorted Daisy off. What an horrible and arrogant thing to do to an excited 3 year old. It's somewhere I had to go, and will again, because the little one loves everything Disney. Clearly, everything Disney does not love the little ones back   just the big ones' wallets.","Negative"
"Firstly, We've found a way of buying cheaper tickets at Disneyland Paris but you'll have to find the Ticket Page and then on the left, drop down menu, you'll find current offers and after some searching around you'll see Tickets that can be pre booked for 33% Less and the Tickets are valid for a Year from the purchase date which is an amazing saving! I would like to say that Disneyland Paris was amazing this year and the Parade was one of the Best with Elsa & Anna being added from Frozen which my Daughter loved even the fact that it was raining didn't stop us waiting almost an extra 40 minutes for the parade to start but it was well worth the wait in the end! We met with Mickey & Minnie and had our pictures taken which was great but even after all of this, there are a few things that need to be addressed by the management and I would say, it is very difficult to find any characters to have your picture taken with and if by chance, you find one, you've arrived to late and they are whisked off in the blink of an eye which seems a little unfair on all the children that want nothing more than to have a memory of their childhood cartoon character even if only for a brief second but theres more, we arrived at the park very early as we understand how long you must wait to see the Princesses so after queuing for over an hour just for a ticket we were told that the earliest show was 18:40pm and considering that it was only 10:00am that seemed a very long wait with a 3 Year old but regardless we waited and it was fantastic. I would highly recommend that you take a Backpack with Lunch (We Didn't) as the food is so highly overpriced it will make you feel sick that you are paying about 60 Euros for a small meal with 1 drink each and its no better than food from a service station so my advise would be to prepare for a long day ahead so include plenty of Water and some decent Sandwiches and snacks. I would drive here once a month if I could as its truly magical and the second park is getting better and better, the Motor show is a must for any petrol head and has a real Lightning McQueen in the show and apart from that the stunt drivers were amazing. The merchandise is cheaper shopping on the online official Disney Store but take the magic away of buying at the Park but you'll pay 35% More so keep this in mind as you can get carried away with the amount of shops!","Positive"
"Wherever I go, I consider the entrance fees and I can say paying 510 HKD ($65) is worth it as every attractions were amazing. The queues aren't that bad in every attractions and if you spend the whole day here, you'll come home satisfied. I advise, come as early as you could.","Positive"
"We stayed at the recommended Disney Hotel the Dreamcastle Hotel from December 22nd to 29th and visited the parks for 6 days. As a family of four with a 5 and 2 year old we were going to Disney for the magic of the Disney Characters and the parades. We found these to be very good and my 5 year old daughter was enraptured when she got to cuddle Minnie, her favourite character. Fake snow down Main Street was lovely.Overall, however the park was very busy and hence the queues for most rides ridiculous. In Fantasyland we queued for 90 minutes for the Dumbo ride and instead of enjoying the ride the children were in tears by the time they got on. The Peter Pan ride was also a disappointment   no special effects and jerky movement. It's a Small World did not disappoint and we only queued for 20 minutes to get on this. We saw most of the shows our favourites being Cinemagic and the Stunt Show. The shows with the characters were good but confusing for our 5 year old as they were half in French, half in English even the songs. The Legend of the Lion King Show had specific shows for English or French which is a better idea. We found the rides in the Disney Studios to be good   esp the Aerosmith Rollercoaster, (don't even bother with Space Mountain   this one is much better and queues are less), and the Hollywood Tower. We also thought the Babyswitch system was excellent. This enabled my husband and daughter to queue to go on a ride and when they had been on it I could get on within 5 mins by going through the Fast pass entrance. People with little ones   use this service. We found the French people very friendly and there was not much shoving and if someone did step in front of you in a queue then we stepped straight back in front of them   livens up the wait anyway! I do think the park looks a little tired. It was a lot to pay for a bit of Disney magic at Christmas and this is all that was worth it really. Fast rides can be found at Alton Towers in the UK   no need to go all the way to France, especially seeing as most could do with updating. Finally the food costs as we expected were terrible. Also the quality of food, (which is mostly burgers and chips) is dreadful. My husband queued for 20 mins to get these for lunch in Disney Studios and when we took a bite the burgers were stone cold resulting in having to go and get replacements all round. Coffee and hot chocolate is 3 euros a cup. I would not return to Disneyland Paris in a hurry. Characters aside, it needs to be updated and the food outlets need improving. Florida here we come.","Neutral"
"I have been to Disneyland countless times but have to say I've been disappointed with the higher ticket prices and annual passes. Disneyland has always been clean and efficient and have top notch rides and shows but is it really worth $125 per person when it is extremely crowded and they continue to gouge you for money once you are inside the park? I don't think so. Be prepared to spend a lot of money if you are visiting the parks and make sure this won't break your budget. Once you are there, enjoy the fun and try not to get upset with the crowds. Disneyland is really the best for amusement parks. It is just the price to enjoy the day with your family that must be taken into account. Have a magical day!","Positive"
"My Daughter had been wanting to go to Disneyland for quite some time so this year we decided to celebrate her birthday at Disneyland. We went in the month of June and it was Super hot. We were literally burning. It's all in the open, there are no shaded areas. Thus we were so tired in just 2 3 hours. Could not really enjoy anything. Except for the princess show which was in the auditorium, I didn't really like anything over there. It's not worth the price we have to pay. My kids also didn't really enjoy much.","Negative"
"All of the rides start from the minimum at very small heights. Space Mountain and Big Grizzly Bear are my favourite rides, but I don't want to ruin the suprise!","Positive"
"Whether you come to this magical place with your significant other, family or friends, one thing you can be sure of is that you will have fun! I have been here countless time, and I think the must  dos  is definitely eating the churro and clam chowder bread bowl and riding the Space Mountain!","Positive"
"We all loved Disneyland, what a great place to have some great family fun. So much to see and do, even if a ride was busy there was always something to keep the kids happy. We will definitely be coming back when Starwars opens, can   t waut to see what they come up with. So much detail in the park now, so my expectations are pretty high for this coming attraction! Simply, the happiest place on earth!","Positive"
"For the price of the ticket we expect a bit more warm and friendly welcome from the park esp the employees. I understand generally people in HK move fast lane but that is not an excuse to be such dry and to some extend snobbish with us the guests. Be more helpful and precise in giving directions and help us understand the park guide even though they are not in charge at customer service section.Weather was almost completely wet thoughout the season and we would expect the park to be more proactive in arranging schedule for parade and fireworks such as early information. Delay and cancellation of fireworks were stressful for children who could have left in happiness to watch it. The least we expect is to give info for us to be prepared with season like now or give little discount as people travel across the world for this, end up fireworks cancel. Yesterday it delayed almost 45 minutes and informed only after 20 minutes pass the schedule time, it cause huge distress to most young children.","Neutral"
"What would a trip to Paris be without a trip to Disneyland. We had been looking forward to this for so long to feel some of that magic but it was just not there. We were two family   s with 4 kids aged between 2 and 14. A number of rides were closed which was disappointing and wait times for most rides were 45 60 mins. Even our pre teen kids were getting annoyed with that but how do you tell a toddler that he has to wait 45mins to get on a dumbo ride so most of the time we gave up. Even the train ride one of the stations was closed with no signage so had to walk all the way back to find a 60 min wait but closing in 30???Not that rides are the main attraction for us but there were no characters wandering around etc. We found navigating the park with the map and app difficult and many times the wifi dropped out so the wait times would not show. Even just finding a place to sit and eat was a challenge. To me it felt like one big gift shop.Am I glad we did Disneyland, yes, would I return, probably not.","Neutral"
"We have been to Disneyland in Anaheim and it is much bigger than this one. That said the parade that they have in the afternoon was spectacular and there has been no expense spared. The best rides are Space Mountain and the RC racer in Toy Story Land.I expected the food to be expensive but $105HK ( which is $21AUD) for 3 Mickey Mouse ice creams is ridiculous. The gifts in the gift stores didn't seem too overly priced. We got the 2 day pass and we went back on the second day in the afternoon thinking it may be quieter   it wasn't. The longest we waited was 30 minutes in a line but most of the wait time was 5 to 10 minutes. My daughter is 11 and she really enjoyed the day and that is what we all go to Disneyland for. ","Neutral"
"Very expensive Disney park, expect to pay and pay for everything. Much made in China toys everywhere to buy. The food places were nothing extra  but I recommend buying autograph book before entering cafe mickey where one then can collect all autographs in short time. The western show was also nice, but have to be there in advance then you'll meet mickey and friends while waiting. Otherwise the attraction queues were like 1 h each, and the rides were a bit slow and some even not perhaps worth the wait. I recommend thinking twice about queueing a long time  there is much to be seen and experienced also beside the rides. The best rides were ratatouille and small world. Other; bring your rain poncho with you. the single time used costs up to 10 euros in the park. Pick nicks are allowed in areas, but we managed with just small snacks while walking. Many brought their food in the queue combining the waiting and the eating  a brilliant idea since the time was so long. There are security checks at the gates, so leave sharp objects such as selfie sticks at home. The parade and the ending show is worth to be seen. Note the ending show also consist all villains at the end and might be frightening for children at that part  they collected all villains in a 5 min long tribute. Noteworthy; it might be good to put on your children an id band with name and telephone of parents if you think the child is too small to remember themselves numbers. This is because there is a lot of people and children and much to be seen  and if the child do get lost its easier to reconnect. The park does offer a lot of made in China Taiwan  Bangladesh but does not offer any Id bands nor stickers nor any other piece of reconnection for the children. Even to be bought. We had one just in case; a multiuse band which we bought at legoland. This could be a development idea for Disney park? Some children might loose their parents and be too frightened or panicked to remember numbers or names. I would gladly bought one more with Donald Duck etc.","Neutral"

"So, DisneyLand. I admit I haven   t been since I was eight and was returning in my mid 30   s with no children of my own. The crowds were overwhelming, even though this was supposed to be the slow season, and so much was under renovation that you hoped the exorbitant ticket price you paid had been discounted a bit considering how many things had been closed down or altered for construction. Still, it   s Disney and you   ve got to do this for the niece and nephew you never see as you all live in different states. It was all pretty exciting seeing it through a child   s eyes, although I   ll admit I was too busy watching out for caffeine crazed, buggy pushing moms on a mission to do much seeing from their point of view. Actually, I   d imagine things would be more terrifying at their height, but they seemed happy enough with thoughts of Mickey and Minnie dancing around in their heads. There were too many moments of real life Frogger (for all you old people) to count. We made a valiant effort in Frontierland and Tomorrowland, but there   s so much of the park and only so much you can do with such ridiculously long lines (again, this was the slow season) that I have no idea how much we missed. With the incredible push to get to the park as early as possible to try and beat the crowds, then the lengthy wait because everyone else had the same idea you did, and then the need to shut down the park 12 hours later in order to squeeze out every possible experience because the price of those tickets was no joke     I saw more crying children and grim faced parents than I saw happy ones. We were all tired and certain we were being taken advantage of, but you have to do this for the kids  right? We bought a $4 bottle of water (16oz), which I began to fill up from bathroom faucets because the water fountains were few and far between. Isn   t that a safety risk? Maybe they assume water IS readily available, just for $4 at your nearest souvenir shop. Ridiculous. We bought tiny $12 chicken sandwiches in the Winnie the Pooh area and honestly asked ourselves what we were doing there. We headed over to The Blue Bayou for dinner, as it was my sister in law   s birthday and this was her favorite place. Unfortunately, we encountered one of Disney   s villains while there   a host who was over being a decent human being. We couldn   t get a table because they require reservations, although my brother apparently got different information when he   d called earlier to make said reservation, and this rude host made things far worse with his horrible attitude. I   ve never encountered any one so awful in the service industry and I   m from the service industry. It was shocking. It was cool to meet Chewbacca and Darth Vader and see my niece and nephew light up when meeting Tigger and Pooh   those memories are priceless, but I   m still not certain they   re worth what we ended up parting with by the end of the day. We ached all over for days afterwards and tried not to think about all the money spent. At some point, one has to wonder why we do these things to ourselves. Why do we let these companies take such advantage?","Neutral"
"We visited from the 2nd of August for 5 days with half of europe. I knew it would be busy but the staff could not cope with the demand. All rides said they had a min of 30 mins queue, most were 70 80 mins but these were not accurate timings, it normally took longer. Rock and Roll Space Mountain and thunder mountain broke down a few times a day. Ratatouille didn't get going until 10.30 am (after we had queued since 9.30 it took another 40 mins to get on the ride). Fast track tickets are better but you are not straight on the ride, you had to queue. On the last day we gave up after a couple of hours.To get a drink with the half board vouchers it took half an hour. Fast food was 40 mins. I will never visit this place again. If you are going in August then I wish you good luck.","Negative"
"Having visited Disneyworld in Florida several times we thought we would try Disneyland whilst in California.We found the whole experience rather underwhelming ,rides closed ,rides breaking down whilst on them, and some long waits even for fast pass.The electric parade and late night fireworks were very good, but we think that the admission prices are far to high for this theme park.,Walt Disney world not be impressed ! This might be the original Disney but it falls way short of the Disneyworld Florida.","Negative"

"We have been to Disneyland 6 times. It always busy especially during Spring Break and Summer times. Plan ahead to avoid long line ups. We always go for the hopper tickets so we can go between the 2 parks on the same day. For first time visitor, I recommend a 3 5 day hopper. Go early to avoid long line ups. Take advantage of the Magic Morning access. Download the Disneyland app to view wait times and show times for the events. Buy the MaxPass ($10 per ticket) to get your FastPass using your phone without going to each distribution location, and you get all the photos from the Disney photographers. Get your FastPass early. Populate rides in California Adventure are Radiator Springs Racers (Cars Land), Guardians of the Galaxy, and Soarin' Around World. If you don't want to get wet on the Grizzly River Run, ensure to bring a poncho. Populate rides in Disneyland park include Space Mountain and Indiana Jones. Disneyland allows you to bring your own food and drink if you want to save money. You can ask for a cup of water at any food outlets without buying a bottle of water. If you want to save some money on Disneyland merchandise, you can get some products from the Targets store nearby.","Positive"
"I have been to Disneyland in Anaheim many times and have always enjoyed the experience.I am not sure what happened when I visited it last week. We firstly visited the haunted house, and waited over an hour in line, then 20 minutes in the elevator which takes us down to the cars. I thought , well it is summer and this is to be expected.We then found that ride was not the only broken one. The Tower of terror was nearly a 2 hour wait, as 2 of the elevators of 4 were broken, space mountain had a longer wait than normal another hour and a half, and I saw the theme reoccurring. I felt sorry for the parents and children on Roger rabbit ride, it too has some issues with equipment and times were longer than usual. The children behind me in line had waited over an hour and were bored and restless, as were other children around me and I am sure their experience was not a positive one. I heard their parents complaining and not wanting to return. I am not sure if they were having problems in the hot weather or crowds were larger than normal.Sadly it means that the longer you wait the less rides you are able to particpate on. Of course there are the express passes, but you can only use them within a set timeframe.By the the end of the day we were fairly tired, and it was a hot day, we had decided to visit the California Adventure Park section and go and eat at the Alfresco Tasting terrace. Surprisingly the reception area girl told us the place was full, or in their words, their commitment compliment had reached optimum quota numbers. We were told we could go and try the fast food places opposite. Firstly if we had wanted that style of food we would not be trying their establishment and secondly its a strange thing to be pushing other places which do not attempt to serve the same style food. She did not seem to see the problem. Finally after explaining our options she offered their restaurant terrace??? Which apparently had not reached the commitment quota compliment, as had the downstairs section. Why was this the last option?? We happily accepted this as we could choose a glass of wine and have some local cheeses etc. We were perplexed as to why this option was LAST.Inexperience on her part??? She had another person working with her who did not say anything to us about it either. Maybe they were both inexperienced in hospitality.As much as I enjoy Disneyland, this experience was not the best one I have had.","Negative"

"Bought a two day two park ticket and went to studios park first, we were there for 10 in the morning, wow, the queues for rides are just incredible, most things are at least 30 to 60 mins, ordered a fast pass for ratatouille, went on maybe three or four rides for the rest of the day due to queues, went to the car stunt show in the afternoon which was excellent.Tried a few more rides and by that time it was 7 at night and we had had enough!Decided to change tack on day two, went to the park mid afternoon (well 1630), everyone was starting to wait on Main Street for the parade. We decided to give that a miss and carried on up to fantasy land, as everyone else was watching the parade the rides were slightly less busy, maybe 15 min wait, we then waited 30 mins for Peter Pan and by that time it was maybe 1830 and the park was getting quieter, we were actually able for most of the rest of the night to walk straight onto some rides, including pirates of the Caribbean!By 2130 we had been on probably double the amount of rides than the day before in half the time!We then got comfortable for the fireworks and light show at 2300, I have to say it was spectacular and well worth waiting for.So overall, we had a fantastic night, but found it very, very frustrating during the day. Our tip, go at night, but each to their own.","Positive"
"spent 2 days in park all i can say is too may people too few rides and everything is so over priced complete rip off, went to get fast passes que for that was about 100 deep and machines not working properly so long wait for fast pass only to join another que about 40 mins long when your time arrived. Drinks are so expensive 8 euro for pint and 5 for half 3.75 euro for kids cokeGo to florida","Negative"

"Hong Kong Disneyland shouldn't really be advertised as Disneyland haha. It's super small and while it is very cute, it was just a little sad. Tomorrow land isn't really tomorrow land, more like tomorrow corner. Space mountain isn't as cool. No splash mountain, no Haunted Mansion :( Staff weren't really friendly, a bit cold. Just kinda strange experience. You can't go into the castle, no Peter Pan ride! Haha other than that it's not really as expensive to get in, and it is very fun to go to Disneyland in another country right? So go and have fun, but be prepared. Hope this helps!! :)","Neutral"
"Just returned from four days in EuroDisney. Wow! The prices are AMAZING! 17.95 Euros for a burger (cold) and chips lunch per person after a long queue. Stayed at the Vienna Dream castle Hotel   great but a small beer was 6.96 Euros and tea or coffee in room an extra 6 Euros. Had a VERY Small lasagne in Rainforest cafe and it cost 21 Euros. What planet are they on?? Merchandise pricey too. 10 Euros for a mug! Kids loved it but then they didn't have to pay. Don't go unless you have loads of money and enjoy queing. On Sundays the Parisiennes arrive in droves and queues were 90 minutes. A fastpass at 3.00 p.m. gave a time of 8.15 p.m.!","Negative"
"Unless you're a big fan of Disney, this HK Disney park is not really that fun.The shows are quite good, but the rides and other things to do are not really something worth spending money and half a day for. Fireworks were good, but not that amazing.It's not that terrible, we just felt that we should've stayed in the city proper and explored there instead, afterall, we came to HK for the uniques HK culture, sights and food. The park did not really show the uniqueness of Hong Kong, so you can just go to other amusement parks, especially if you're not travelling with kids. Enjoyed Ocean Park way more.Don't think I'm coming back here.","Negative"
"Spent the whole day there from 11.00 am and caught the train there. Bought my ticket on Klook app and received a discount which made a difference. You are not allowed to bring in food or drink but they let me have a small water bottle that I filled at rest stations through out the park. Food was ordinary and some outlets not open. Food stands were better and cheaper,...I ate before I got there so only snacked. Every ride and theatricals are included in your entry price and at the end of every ride you walk out into a shop of souvenirs but save your buying until the end otherwise you have to carry it around and the shops stay open for a short while after the fireworks. The parade in the day was fun and the night one was fabulous. The fireworks at the end was worth the wait and a good tip is is to position yourself straight after the night parade for the best view. Avoid weekends and I went on a Tuesday and it was not overcrowded. All staff were excellent.","Positive"

"Disneyland is a special place for us because it has been kept mostly as Walt created it. We can feel his impact in the design and attractions, and some of the staff. We travel 3000 miles to go here every few years. The original feel of the park and maintaining it as Walt would have kept us coming back. Great moments with Abraham Lincoln is newly redone and great. It is an inspirational experience. We should require our politicians to attend regularly! Our other favorite show is Billy Hill and the Hillbillies. The park is well maintained and clean. A big difference between here an WDW is attitude. It is noticeably different, and WDW seems to have the edge. Both places have appreciable differences and should be seen by Disney fans. If you just want roller coasters go to 6 flags, etc.","Positive"
"If you are thinking of visiting Disneyland Paris this year I would wait, if you could until next year.There are a lot of rides closed and building work going on,starting from your approach to the park ,boarding's up to the garden  fountain area,again around the Disneyland station so you do not get any view until you have got around them.These boarding's are a familiar sight throughout every area of the park,and it is the big rides closed Thunder mountain,Peter pan,Rock n Rollercoaster,The Riverboat,,in fact frontierland is near non existent,in all on our visit 13 rides where closed for long term whilst the refurbishment programme is going on,We where informed a lot of the work will be completed in time for it's 25 years in 2017,but that did not mean anything to us we where there then and when we booked in Sept for a May trip there was no mention of this work.The ticket prices remain the same,and with so many closures the queues where up to 2 hours.We did this que to meet the Disney princesses or so we thought.No it was one princess,we had to que again to meet another one etc etc,we managed three,same to meet mickey mouse,but couldn't. Get near Minnie she was only in the park for an hour and the que had already been closed at 10 am the parks opening time to the general public.Of course we would go back again,but we would have given this trip a miss if we had known about the vast amount of building work going on,and Disney should reflect this in their ticket pricing","Neutral"
"This park is a huge merchandise operation with some dated rides spotted around. We arrived at 10 am for the park opening and the crowds were already huge. There were times when the crowds were so think we were gridlocked. That meant waiting in line for a minimum of 90 minutes even with fast pass. We were there all day and one child only went on four rides and the other went on six. The lines to the rides were one thing but the lines for the restaurants were equally daunting with up to 30 minutes wait for really bad food. Then there were the lines for the characters which were on a schedule. So my kids didn't get a photo with any because we're always too late for the timings. 25% of the rides were under repair and some of them broke down and had to be closed momentarily. The parades were ok but the park needs refurbishing. Save your money and go to the Disney in Florida.","Negative"
"Visited half term June 2012, parks are small & few rides. You can easily do both parks in one day if you get to studios at 10 and Disneyland parc late afternoon so save your money if you must go just get the one day ticket. Staff unfriendly and miserable (so not the Disney ethos) toilets stink and no atmosphere. Only decent rides Hollywood tower, aerosmith and indiana jones and at least 3 main rides were closed. Car stunt show was entertaining but 2 hour wait horrendous and 3000 people crammed into grandstand like sardines. Disney village very poor and expensive we ate at annette's (food cold) and earl of sandwich (revolting) shops were rubbish. Best entertainment was buffalo bills wild west show (food was ok seating good & show entertaining) suggest anyone considering going to Disneyland paris saves up & heads to Florida instead for the real disney experience.","Negative"
"Magic Mornings are a joke. Disneyland does not open all security checks so lines back up. They cannot move the people in the entrance gates quickly. Long waits to enter sets a bad tone for the day in  February, which has fewer visitors than other months.The happiest place on earth, has cast members yelling at a 2 year old pulling on the rope that he is holding to end the line to visit Buzz. What does one expect from a two year old who is waiting in yet another line.A very nasty cast member in city hall refused to discussed disability access when asked questions based on written material that disney publishes on their website.So much for the happiest place on earth.","Negative"
"This was our third trip to Disneyland Paris (previous, magical visits in 2008 and 2009) and I'm sorry to say it will be our last. I was shocked at how 'tired' everything looked and more than a little surprised that a fair number of the rides were closed for refurbishment (during the Easter Holidays, of all times)?! The queues for the (functioning) rides were unforgivably long, with nothing to occupy the kids' time whilst we were waiting. We saw probably three Disney characters in the park during the three days we were there, (excluding those in the parade) and the children were completely disheartened by the lengths of the queues to have their photos taken with them.... needless to say we didn't bother. I didn't really see the point of the Fast Pass system as you can only really use it for one ride per day (possibly two if you can actually find more than one Fast Pass system open at any one time) and on numerous occasions, rides were suddenly closed due to faults and or malfunctions. We actually witnessed people being led down the side of 'Thunder Mountain' as their coaster had broken down halfway through the ride! Hardly the 'Magical Disney Experience' they were expecting, I'm sure. We found eating at lunchtime to be a complete nightmare. One day we actually queued, in an average burger restaurant, for over an hour, only to find the lady who had served us had got our order completely wrong, but hardly surprising considering she was having to contend with dozens of frustrated and angry customers and was clearly feeling more than a little out of her depth. I actually felt sorry for her and was more angered at Disney's utter incompetence towards basic customer requirements.I'm so very sorry to say this time our Disney experience certainly didn't meet our expectations and I won't be recommending it to anybody anytime soon. Very disappointing.","Neutral"
"Huge place to explore with many interesting spot. Have great memories in this place. Do purchase your ticket earlier because you wont want to line up with long queue at the ticket counter.","Neutral"
"Park is amazing! There is a park for children to do at least three days, but recommends avoiding long queues and buy the Express cards. To make the experience complete, you may want to stay in a hotel of the park, where children can enjoy the characters walking around the hotel. An enchanting experience for children.","Positive"
"Recently took our family of 9 to San Diego and took a day trip to Disneyland. It was definitely the low light of the trip. $840 for $105 dollar one day park hopper tickets for very little enjoyment. The lines were awful! Fastpass was 4 hours later??!!! some fast pass! Got on 2 rides, spacemountain and Tower of Terror in a four hour period. Not worth it. Only enjoyment was seeing our granddaughter's excitement seeing the castle but no characters anywhere to be found. Very disappointing. Go to the San Diego Zoo.....worth every penny!","Negative"
"Oh where to start, I will admit I am not a theme park enthusiast, but I am a team player and the husband and small boys love them, so I play along. But to say I loathe this place after our latest visit would be an understatement.This is our fourth visit in three years....I have never been a fan but my distaste is strong.Our biggest change and disappointment was the discontinuation of the former DAS program while there are still minor accommodations for those wanting to enjoy the park with disabilities it is a far reach one size fits all pass, that only applies to rides with current fast pass availability. Many of those rides are not the ones young children would seek out. We end up riding Astro Blasters all day because it's the most accommodating. This program could be better suited as a tiered program where the adjustments are made based on need. Physical disabilities require different accommodations than mental disabilities.The overall line durations were in the 45 90 minute range this is unacceptable in my opinion when paying over $100 per ticket per person per day. If at the park for 10 hours and you stop to eat overpriced, close to expired food twice in that day you might luck out and hit 7 rides that last less than 2 minutes each.The food is lousy, (excluding the fried chicken) they have no refillable drink cups despite the fact other theme parks in California do (they cite health regulations when I asked), so your spending $3 $4 minimum per drink. Food line ups are long and you can bank on $60 to feed a family of 4.Then there is my biggest peeve of all, rude staff and that damned parade! I take huge issue with Disney encouraging people to line up 2.5 hours Before the Parade. They rope off huge areas and drive the masses through 6' pathways that include wheelchairs, strollers, excited kids and grumpy grown ups. I think this dangerous, annoying and catering to the minority. Trying to move around once these ropes (barricades) are in place is like threading needles. It's painful!I'm not a fan, it's not the happiest place on earth and to say I despise their business model would be an understatement.Hope to say I'm never coming back!","Negative"
"It's always packed here with long lines for everything   especially the rides. The rides are all very short and not very thrilling   I know Disney is meant to be for all ages but the rides feel like they are made exclusively for kids under 10. Add that with the crowds and I'd rather wait the several years it'll take me to go to the real DisneyWorld.","Negative"
"Been here a few times and it is full of Disney magic. Went once at Christmas time and it was excellent with ice shows and all sorts of things going on  Under 12s especially will love it here","Positive"
"Yeah it's expensive and pretty much all the food offerings are  eh  but it is uber clean with consistently friendly  cast members , and a clear devotion to what Disney is about   the kids. I personally enjoy Disneyland way over Disneyworld. Disneyworld just has too much going on for me. Disneyland is more managable and feels more intimate especially for the young kids. The Disney characters are always accessible, friendly, and abundant all over the park....in fact, I don't think I'd ever do Disneyworld again...next time we go, it will be Disneyland   there is no topping the original. Tip: if you have an iphone, get the MediaLab   s Walkee Disneyland iGuide app....it is awesome! It provides a map of all attractions with wait times, upcoming shows, and even displays where the characters are around the park. I think it was $4 or $5 bucks but it was well worth it   we used it constantly; I don't think we ever used the park map that they hand out when you enter. The app also includes DCA.","Positive"
"This park looked good but when we experienced it,it was terrible!What you would expect is not here at all.The 1st time we experienced it was as soon as we got to the resort and we waited in a queue for a small plane ride for 2 hours.This is unacceptable for a big place such as the Disneyland park.I understand that it attracts many people but the reason for these long queues are rides continuously breaking down and carriages on the rides being left empty.Something should have been done about this as this continued to happen over the 4 days that we stayed.The worst example was the Indiana Jones ride which we queued an hour for,only to be told it was closed when we got to the front.They must waste the time of so many visitors!As well as the long queues,we had rude people pushing in from all angles and going under barriers and the staff doing nothing to stop this.What's the point in queuing if you can just push your way to the front!With an average waiting time of 2 hours (sometimes longer) this was very time consuming,not good for small children.As well as this,the fast passes we were given with the booking weren't accepted at certain times of the day which in my opinion is just stupid.This meant I wasn't able to go on the Hollywood Tower Hotel ride as I was turned away twice!We were let into the park an hour early as we stayed at the Disneyland Hotel but we weren't allowed on the rides until the actual opening time,meaning this advantage was pointless!When the rides did open some were actually very good,it showed that Disneyland does have it's thrills.Space Mountain was incredible and I wish more rides would have been like this. Another thing that should be mentioned is the food.They have plenty of themed restaurants but we found that they all served the exact same poor quality food!We ended up living off chicken burgers for 4 days as everything else was disgusting!The meals were ridiculously overpriced,it would have been acceptable had the food been nice but it was truly appalling!In the 5 park restaurants that we dined in,the menus were hard to understand with unhelpful staff.At one of restaurants we even got food poisoning from eating underprepared chicken which is totally unacceptable for Disneyland Parks.They should be ashamed!However we weren't even offered an apology by the company and it was 2 months until we heard a reply which was  we have found no hygiene problems with the kitchen the meals were prepared in Overall this park is disappointing and I would advise you to not go here,it's not magical and you are just wasting your time!","Negative"
"Actually Hong Kong Disney is one of the smaller Disney parks. Biggest advantage, there are no waiting times (max 5 Mins) if you come during weekdays. The park is not that big, usually you should be through in half a day (I only took the adult rides and shows). For children might be ok, for adults who have been to other parks like Paris it  s dissapointing. Everyday there  s a fireworks show around 20:00 which is worth watching.","Negative"
"overpriced and overrated, hardly any attractions and full of shops that sell the same goods ( at least twice the cost of goods in the UK )long waits everywhere","Negative"
"Half term at Disneyland Paris is not for the feint hearted, a birthday treat for the kids it may have been, but definitely became an exercise in maintaining parental boundaries and discipline. I honestly don   t think I have seen so many chastised kids in one place! Basically this is a total retail experience with a few fairground attractions thrown in. Granted the kids loved seeing the characters and it certainly toughened them up to a more continental approach to the notion of queuing and taking your turn but increasingly as the days passed the whole experience became clearly over priced enticement to buy Disney products. Both Disneyland and Walt Disney Studios have limited rides for toddlers & younger children and all have long queues for a very short ride. The birthday tea party with the characters cost   17 per person (Kids & Adults alike) for that we got coffee, juice and a selection of pastries & marshmallows. The additional Birthday cake cost a further   31 (Booked through Disneydirect). It was a perfectly nice chocolate cake but certainly not a   31 cake! We put all that aside and accepted that like everything else the Disney mark up and increased costs in France played there part. The parks themselves were not fully open and many areas were being repaired or constructed, this certainly didn   t promote the magical experience promised. Our youngest was very confused that all the characters spoke French first and then English this was slightly distracting when trying to suspend his disbelief. While the hotel Cheyenne that we stayed in was comfortable and clean, the dinning arrangements were not an enjoyable experience. The Chuck Wagon cafe provided a buffet style arrangement that involved long queues again despite the laughable encouragement to reserve a table????. Once in the buffet area a free for all ensued which trying to navigate with two kids was a complete nightmare, then locate a free and cleared table to settle everyone to finally eat. Breakfasts were much the same. Oh and If you want a coffee in your room you will need to buy the  tea basket  7e for two tea bags, two coffee sachets, 4 UHT milk pots, 4 sugars and 4 Disney biscuits. I wasn   t naive enough to think that the magic kingdom was really as glossy and wonderful as its adverts would have you believe, however I wasn   t quite prepared to feel as though I'd been totally fleeced by a mouse.My advice if you really want the kids to experience Disney, then go to Florida, at least there   s less chance it will be cold and rainy.","Neutral"
"Having enjoyed a magical trip to Disneyland Paris in 2002 I couldn't wait to return. Boy was I disappointed. 8 of us, 3 under 9yo returned last night from 5 day 4 night trip staying in Sante Fe hotel. (Separate review!) Toilets are disgusting, they used to be spotless on previous visit. Casey Jr train, princess boats, buzz light year ride and Pinocchio all broke down when we were on them. Indiana jones, caption eo, and autopia were all closed for our trip. The litter is appalling, it's everywhere. Food is expensive and sub standard. Queuing time for  interrupted  rides was ridiculous. We tried to voice our disappointment at  City Hall  only to be told to return the next day! The kids loved the parades, the 5.30, the late one at 10pm and especially the special swing into spring show but the late night show didn't compare with the fireworks show in previous years. It's such a pity to see standards have slipped so much. The park needs a major shake up and clean up to be in the same league as the American Disney parks. Tinkerbell had better sprinkle some magic dust here quickly!","Neutral"
"yes this is the smallest of the disney parks, do you need a fully day here, well no. It was busy and hot and several rides had broken down including the rollercoaster and also the car racer in toy story land. They also closed 3 lands at 5pm for a private function, if i knew that I would not have booked as this was not on the website!","Negative"
"Went there with some friends. I was hugely disappointed. Having been to the one in Tokyo, which was great, I was not expecting this to be better. But it was worse than I thought. Long lines everywhere. Yes, I know this is Disney Land. The worse is the locals seem to think it is OK to cut lines anywhere they want. Even worse is the park authorities allow it! Also, it is not clean. Would not come back again.","Negative"
"If you love your children please don't let Disneyland Paris be their first  Disney  experience. I go to a Disney park at least once a year and I always LOVE them. I do not understand why Disney even has their name on this park. The service at Disneyland Paris is deplorable even for French standards. Additionally, if you want your children to get a large dose of second hand smoke take them to Disneyland Paris.The only positive thing about Disneyland Paris is they sell alcohol in the park. You do have to buy food with it so expect to buy a round of beers with a single donut. Additionally, it was nice that the train goes straight to Disneyland from Paris. This has been on my bucket list for years and it certainly is not worth the money even for the biggest Disney fans.","Negative"

"It was in a beautiful location, and convenient to reach via subway.  It only seemed to have a few rides, and all of the stores carried the same merchandise.  It was a fraction of the size of the original Disneyland, but the staff were very...More","Neutral"
"It's 30 years since I last visited and I wouldn't be bothered if it was another 30 before I return.Very expensive $708 for 4 one day park hopper tickets with Maxipass.The WiFi coverage was VERY poor and this made using the app difficult & you needed it for the Maxipass.The staff 'crew members ' looked very shoddy and untidy and some areas of the park looked tired and in need of updating.It was also very crowded.The restaurant we chose to eat in refused my 23 year old daughters driving licence as ID, for her to have an alcoholic drink, sayng their policy was only to accept Passports for foreigners!Overall Disney is now a money making machine and has certainly lost the family centered fun provider of years past.","Neutral"
"We only had 6 hours to do both parks of Disneyland Paris. I have been to both Disneyworld in Florida and Disneyland in California. Disneyland Paris is laid out very similar to Disneyland in California as it has 2 parks. The main park has your more traditional Disney rides (Haunted House, Autotopia, Main street, and Space Mountain) and the other park as tower of terror, Rockin Rollercoaster and Ratatouille. Because we had such a limited amount of time we tried to do things we couldn't do anywhere else. Unfortunately Pirates of the Caribbean was closed and when it started to rain, they close ALL the outdoor rides (which is about 90% of the rides). Our favorite ride was Space Mountain....BEST DISNEY RIDE ANYWHERE!! It is in the dark, but it was like flying through a Star War movie. We loved it!!! Tower of terror is the same and Rockin Rollercoaster is similar. Ratatouille probably was good, but I get motion sickness on simulators and this was like being on a moving simulator the whole time so I closed my eyes! Only 1 in our party loved it, I didn't even see it, and the 4 girls said it was okay. There were so many places to eat! We tried the beignets filled with hazelnut chocolate....Oh my were these good. It doesn't have the Disney polish and people can smoke anywhere and everywhere, which we didn't like. I wouldn't make it a destination vacation, but worth stopping by if you have time while in Paris.","Neutral"
"Magic mornings don't mean anything anymore. You get in a hour early to find out that you only get half the park and out of those rides they didnt have the big rides open like space mountain. Most of the rides are out dated unlike universal. I brought 4 kids ages from 5 to 10 that all liked universal studios better than Disneyland . Will never come here again.","Negative"
"First time being to the Cars Land, the racing was very fun and did it as many times as we could, when the lines were short(early in the morning or late at night.) We had been to DL in November before and it was slow, however, the park hours are based on what size of crowds they expect and the hours were long for most of our visit Nov 19 Nov 26 and YES the CROWDS were BIG, line ups for popular rides 45 120 minutes? We made good use of the lockers located between the two parks, but if you don't get one early, they may all be taken. The staff was very friendly, was suggested to take a photo of your DL ticket, if you should lose it, it  may  help. Our hotel was a bit far away from DL but we gladly paid the $5.00 day person to use the ART shuttle.","Positive"
"This was our 4th visit to Euro Disney and although we had a fantastic break it was definitely not what it used to be in that;People were smoking all over the park including while waiting in queues.Many rides with the same carriages were broken day after day causing longer queues than necessary.No ghosts on the back of the Haunted House Ride?Both times Screen Studio Tram Tours the commentary screens were not working.Music was not always working on the Aero Smith Roller Coaster. Pirates water ride and Crush ride both broke down while we were at the park.Very limited number of rides operating during the parks early opening hours.Lots of restaurants and food stalls were not open for the duration of our visit, therefore massive queues at the ones that were.Captain EO   awful   not a patch on the fantastic 'Honey I shrunk the kids' previously showing.Food unbelievably expensive.","Neutral"

"I had been to WDW florida 3 times previous and decided to go to euro disney instead and have a couple of holidays in europe instead. What a mistake!Even though the parks were OK, the disorganisation in the parks, and the downright rude attitudes of europeans will ensure I never visit Paris again.. Don't get me wrong I am not against the French or europeans in general, I get on with anyone, but it was like the world was going to end as everyone was pushing and shoving, and people were so arrogant ignorant. When I stopped to let someone through they looked at me strange.Disney staff were helpful, but thought they could have done more. I did not try to compare with Florida, but it is clear somethings that are done in Florida would actually work in Paris and give everyone a chance to meet characters and enjoy the disney experience.A very disappointed Disney fan. Will be going to Florida next time...","Negative"
"Too many attractions were closed, so it was hard to find things to do. The show at night is impressive.","Negative"
"Cast members are very friendly.  Best customer service of any theme park that I have been to.  The lines are long but they do have fast pass.  The shows were fantastic.  Highly recommend light show at night at the lake.","Positive"
"It may look the same on a smaller scale, but I found that it just didn't have the same atmosphere. We were there with our 6 year old grandson and he enjoyed it nether the less, one consolation is the queues for rides are not as long and therefore the wait time is considerably less, in my opinion it's not worth buying a fast pass.I think the restaurants could be a little better and offer a wider variety of food, personally I was looking for something a little more healthy and ended up with a burger.The train around the park was not running when we were there which was a disappointment however it is due to renovations and could not be helped.The highlight for me was to be the fireworks and due to the weather it was cancelled at the last minute, obviously they are not in control of the weather but it would be nice if we were issued a special pass to enter just for the fireworks on another night without having to purchase another one day pass.","Neutral"
"Coming here for the first time after being at DisneyWorld more than 10 times. The wonderful compact location makes getting around much faster and easier, however the crowds in summer are crazy. Line wait times never die down so you must do your favorite rides right when the park opens.","Positive"
"We aren't really Disneyphiles but we have been to all of them by default since we have a child. Seeing we were going to be in Paris, we figured we might as well hit up the local Disneyland, even if it was cold and rainy. We were able to see the park when it wasn't so crowded so that was a relief....all Disneys become nightmares in busy season.There were local touches that were appreciated since you are in France vs. the US. It is nice to see the regional influences and the differences between the parks. This park isn't one of our favorite Disney's but still worth a visit.","Positive"
"A four night, five day Christmas treat. Apart from the cold (December, what do you expect, so no complaints there) we generally enjoyed the parks. The rides are good on the whole, Space Mountain and Thunder mountain both better than Florida, and the hotel (New York) again pretty good, but not my idea of a 4* hotel (other then the price!!).If you stay in a Disney hotel, don't get fooled by the 'Extra Disney Hours', i.e. from 08.00 to 09.30 or 10.00 depending on the park   great, you get in two hours early and most of the rides don't open until 09.30 or 10.00. Space Mountain was open, but not working as 'it had to warm up', well who would have expected it to be cold in December eh!As for 'Crushes Coaster', one of our favourite rides but an 85 minute queue at 08.30 in the morning, at least our breakfast had plenty of time to go down.The two things that put me off gong again (this was our second time), one was the smoking, just about every other person is smoking   in a children's theme park, can you not give up the cigs for a few hours, after a few days I feel I have smoked about 100 cigs worth of other peoples smoke. I realise that people have the right to smoke outdoors, but in queues where you can't move away, with kids everywhere   be fair!!The other is the extortionate cost of food in the parks and hotel, around 40 45 Euros each per meal, for a family of 3 or 4 over a few days that really bites. If you can bear to walk to the Val d'Europe shopping centre or can taxi or drive, lots of decent restaurants where we ate for around 50 60 Euros for a family of three, much better value and gets you out of the park hotel captivity for a while.New York hotel was OK, the lobby, restaurants bars are fine, the bedrooms leave a bit to be desired. The bedrooms could do with an update, although clean and spacious, they are tired, peeling wallpaper, ancient TV (a whole 2 3 channels in English (2 news and the Disney Channel), as i said, for a 4* you should expect more.Overall we enjoyed the stay but wont be going again, we will save and go back to Florida where you can hire a good villa for 2 3 weeks for the same cost as 5 nights in the New York and there is just so much more to do and enjoy.Rod F (December 14)","Neutral"

"We just got home from our first trip to Disneyland and I had heard all the horror stories of lines and people. They do have those, but we covered the whole park in a day. We had a 3 day park hopper pass and did Disney the first day, California Adventure the second day. By the third day, we did half a day in Disney and half a day at California Adventure, and we just repeated the rides we enjoyed the most. Get the fast pass for the busier rides and then go do one or two others in the areas your fast pass ride is in. You can wipe out the park in a day that way. We did every ride there besides the kiddie type rides and we even did a few of those. Matterhorn is fun, hyperspace mountain, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribean and Splash mountain were our favorites. Disneyland seems very compact, but one thing I can say is they can move those lines. They have the best crowd control and as someone is getting off the ride, your getting on. It flows nicely. We did not take kids thankfully because a lot of people with little kids and strollers were not having as much fun. Kids get bored standing in line. We had the Disneyland APP which gives you a layout of the park and wait times. Some of the times would say 45 min wait and we waited no more than 20 min. So use it as a guide, since the times are a bit inaccurate. You can take in water and some food in a backpack which we did. They easily can go on all the rides. Glad we went and if we did it again, it would definitely be in the off season again.","Positive"
"We finally took our 3 year old for the first time and of course we had a good time but it was very crowded and we went mid week, we had to wait in lines for a long time which is hard with a toddler the tickets are pricey but worth to go here and there and the passes keep going up and up but if they stopped offering monthly payments less people would get them and that may solve the problem with crowding not raising thier prices. We paid $35 for autograph book and pen so get one ahead of time for characters and line up for parades early cus you want a good seat. you can also bring in your own food so that will save you expecially when food places close so early in the evening.","Neutral"

"Really enjoyed our family trip to Disneyland Paris, our Grandson aged 5 years had a wonderful time, even though quite a few rides were too old for him or too scary! he particularly enjoyed the Frozen show and meeting the characters' and the Casey Junior train ride. Buzz Lightyear was a hit too. We will be back in a few years when our other grandchildren are old enough to enjoy it!","Positive"
"If you have been to Disneyland 15 years ago or more, be sure you'll find more or less the same thing today. It's not bad, much smaller than Magic Kingdom in Orlando, but they don't improve, they don't create anything new. Same rides since ever (95% of them for children) and that's it. When new characters and movies are launched, they simple redecorate old rides with new style and that's it (Haunted Mansion a good example   or the old Pirates of Caribbean with some Johnny Deep included as well).OK, I totally understand it's all about  living a dream in Disneyland  and bla bla bla, but even so I think the park needs to be improved and upgraded.","Negative"
